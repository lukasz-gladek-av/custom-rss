<p>Start your engines...</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section></header><section><p>A couple of months ago, Sega released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> for the Switch 1, bringing a generally solid kart racer that gave Mario Kart a run for its money. Yet, what held it back from greatness was the overall poor performance, whether you played it on Switch 1 or via backwards compatibility on Switch 2, with each system having its own visual quirks that led to a generally subpar experience. Fortunately, Sega has now put out a native <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> that comfortably fixes the graphical and performance problems.</p>
<p>So, what exactly does the new version bring? Along with a slew of post-launch balance adjustments, some new Gadgets, and an online ranking leaderboard for the truly elite players, the headlining new feature is improved performance across the board: 1440p resolution docked and 1080p resolution portable, with a smooth 60fps for either mode when playing single player or two-player split-screen. This all comes in addition to the mix of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-gets-another-free-guest-character-today">free</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-spongebob-squarepants-dlc-now-available">paid updates</a> that have been steadily releasing, adding new characters like SpongeBob and Joker to the lineup.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:188438 @ 1765458004 -->
<p>As you’d expect, the resolution and frame bumps make this feel like a new game in certain respects, as the whimsical art style and madcap action now pop in a way that the choppy frame rate and blurry resolution couldn’t do justice. Sega clearly did more than just a simple up-res job, too. I noticed many textures have been replaced with more detailed variants and there are more environmental details like foliage that help to liven up the area around the main road.</p>
<p>With this version, I’d honestly say that Nintendo has a competitor on Switch 2 that is at the very least equal to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> if not better in certain respects. Though there’s no half-baked open-world mode to really drive home the comparison, the tight mechanics, smartly designed tracks, and a wealth of content all come together to make for a pretty compelling alternative, even if there’s a certain classic quality to Nintendo’s evergreen kart racer that’s hard for any other company to emulate. And also, it’s <em>really</em> weird that SpongeBob and Patrick don’t have any voices.</p>
<p>All told, I’d say that this version is certainly worth the punt if you’re invested in playing this on Nintendo platforms - the Switch 2 Edition fixes the issues that were holding this game back from being truly great. Unfortunately, owners of just the Nintendo Switch won’t benefit from these optimisation improvements, but if you already own this game and have a Switch 2, the $10 upgrade feels like a reasonable price to pay for such a notable leap over the old version. I’d suggest picking this up, if only to experience what a great kart racer <em>not</em> made by Nintendo can be like.</p></section></article><div><p>Mitch has been a fan of Nintendo ever since he got his start on the GBA in 2005.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-6tb-external-hard-drive-hits-0-02-per-gb-after-falling-even-lower-than-black-friday-in-an-early-christmas-deal-2000652312</link>
            <guid>1379476</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage problems are common, but they don’t have to hold you back. If your current devices are overflowing with files, media content, and projects, it’s high time you grab a spacious external hard drive to get things moving again.</p>
<p>Depending on the capacity you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but not today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">The WD 6TB portable external hard drive for PC and Mac is going for $137 at Amazon right now, after a sweet $33 discount</a>. It’s spacious enough to house all your important data, and the compact size makes it easy to carry your entire library with you, wherever you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stores All Your Important Files</h2>
<p>This portable drive works with both Windows and Mac. It comes formatted for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.1, meaning you can just plug it into the USB 3.0/2.0 port of your device using the included cable to start transferring your files; no additional drivers needed. Users of Mac and other operating systems will need to reformat it manually, but the process is fairly straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Once all is set, you’re going to enjoy fast transfers, even when moving large files around.</p>
<p>It’s great for both work professionals and creatives looking to offload heavy stuff that’s taking up a lot of space on the internal drive. The 6TB capacity is quite spacious, and easily capable of housing thousands of high-resolution photos, hundreds of old and new videos, massive creative projects, long research papers, large office documents, and even your favorite gaming titles. We won’t say it’s a forever storage solution, because our needs will grow faster than you think, but it’ll still take you a long way before you need to upgrade again. Think at least a couple of years, unless you’re trying to create an unusually large creative or gaming library.</p>



<p>Its compact size and portability are another strong selling point. It sits nicely on your desk without taking up a lot of space, and slides into any backpack easily, without bulking things up. You’ll be able to take all your important stuff with you on the go; just plug it into your laptop or a remote desktop when you’re out and about, and access whatever you need instantly!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">On a regular day, this drive would run you around $170, but the current 19% discount drops it to just $137.</a> It’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in the last 30 days. If 6TB is more than what you need, there are several other configurations available, all of which are discounted. For instance, the 1TB version is sitting at just $59. You can also grab the 2TB model for $70, or the 4TB option for $114. Additionally, if you’re someone who deals with large chunks of data for different tasks on a regular basis, it’s also a good time to pick up a couple of these!</p>

              <p>Nintendo has just added a new game to its collection of GameCube Classics for the Switch 2’s Online + Expansion Pack subscription: 3D platform game <em>Wario World</em>.</p> <p>I’ve always loved the very existence of Wario. Antithesis villain characters are woefully underused in the realm of video games, despite those that we’re familiar with being so bloody brilliant. Wario, Shadow the Hedgehog…um… See! Oh wait, there was that Evil Crash Bandicoot that one time, right? But where’s a goatee-wearing Joel Miller who sides with the infected? Or a mirror world of mustachioed Pokémon, looking to capture human trainers in silver, spiky balls? (You know what the real problem is? In trying to think of examples for this dumb joke, I realized that nearly all video game leads these days are already antiheroes, which sucks.)</p> <p>Wario is the perfect platonic example of an antithesis character, the result of flipping an ‘M’ upside down and the pure evil that results. Yes, I have enormous love for Waluigi, but Wario is the OG. And let’s be honest, “Waluigi” is a semantic stretch. “Wario” is so clever not just because it invokes a Mario from the Upside Down, but because <i>warui</i> (悪い) literally means “bad.” No notes.</p>

 <p><em>Wario World</em> was the gold-loving monster’s first outing that wasn’t on a handheld. (Wario jokes at the start of the game that “I’ve always been stuck in those liquid crystal displays, but not anymore!”) While not made in-house at Nintendo—instead by Treasure, the team that brought us&nbsp;<em>Gunstar Heroes</em> and <em>Bangai-O</em>—it was clearly inspired by the design of <em>Mario 64</em>, albeit with a fixed camera, but with a much greater focus on combat.</p>

  <p>And it was good! Not great, not a <em>Mario</em>-like game-changing event, but a good, solid and extremely busy action-platformer. However, the concerns on its original 2003 release are somewhat lessened with the passing of time, not least the contentious nature of its brevity and price.&nbsp;<em>Wario World</em> was a premium game, but over in eight hours, and that sucked. But in 2025, when it’s the latest addition in a subscription pack you most likely pay for so you can play Switch games online, that issue becomes far less important. The retracing your steps and over-reliance on boss fights will still irk, but hey, it&nbsp;<em>feels</em> like it was free.</p> <p><em>Wario World</em> joins <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-ZERO GX</em>, <em>Soulcalibur II</em>, <em>Mario Smash Football</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo!</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> in the GameCube Classics collection. Still to be added but said to be coming soon are <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em> and&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Colosseum</em>.</p>

The D-pad sports a healthy radioactive glow, and several other design elements replicate the Valued-Added Targeting System from Fallout. Beyond that, this is a standard Xbox wireless controller.</p><p>It's still the same design that was introduced five years ago, with textured triggers, tactile face buttons, and a very clicky D-pad. These controllers can be powered by AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack sold separately; they're equipped with an audio jack for wired headphones, and their ergonomic design still makes them very comfortable to use for long stretches.

            <p>Last night, Japanese singer Koda Kumi gave us all a live performance of Real Emotion from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy 10</a>-2, and immediately transported me back to 2003.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 10-2 was the first mainline game in the series to receive a sequel, and its opening song - performed by protagonist Yuna along with returning character Rikku and new face Paine - has proven popular ever since.</p>

<p>I have always found great enjoyment in the Final Fantasy series, with 8, 9 and 10 especially playing a key part into my early video game education (I wanted a dog called Angelo for quite a long time when I was little. I also dyed my hair dark with a blonde steak a la Rinoa once).</p>
<p>But one Final Fantasy game that will always remember playing is 10-2, which opens with Yuna transforming from the relatively reserved summoner we first met in 2001 into a fully fledged pop star. The song she sings at the start of 10-2 quickly became my backing track for the year, and I can still recite the lyrics (in English, at least) at the drop of a hat over two decades later.</p><p>So, when I saw a post yesterday saying that Koda Kumi would be performing Real Emotion from Final Fantasy 10-2 on Japanese TV that night, I was flooded with a sense of nostalgia and the desire to have a little bop in my kitchen. For those unaware, Koda Kumi performed the Japanese version and did the motion capture for the Real Emotion full motion video shown at the start of Final Fantasy 10-2.</p>
<p>I hunted the performance down on YouTube this morning, and even 20 plus years later, Koda Kumi has still got it. Watching it made me feel like I was a pre-teen once again (which is no small feat given that these days I regularly crick my back just by getting out of bed).</p>
<p>You can check out Koda Kumi's live performance of Real Emotion in the video below.</p>

<p>More recently in Final Fantasy news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi revealed that the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-team-almost-downsized-clouds-humongous-buster-sword-to-make-it-more-realistic">once considered downsizing Cloud's iconic Buster Sword</a>.</p>
<p>"How Cloud swings it around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know," the developer explained. "So at the time, when we were making Remake, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword."</p>
<p>Personally, I am glad they decided against this idea.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Starts Offloading AMD Ryzen 7 at an All-Time Low in CPU Clearance Push]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-starts-offloading-amd-ryzen-7-at-an-all-time-low-in-cpu-clearance-push-2000652290</link>
            <guid>1379449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers know that the hunt for the best processors for their rigs usually boils down to speed and cores, and they also know an unlocked processor can be pushed beyond its factory-set limits for maximum performance. A sneaky-good unlocked gaming processor just hit Amazon’s sale shelf — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">the AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT, an unlocked chip ready to be overclocked, is just $183 after a 27% price drop.</a></p>
<p>The next-gen chips bring fatter spec sheets and sexier reviews, but the 5800XT’s 8 cores and 16 threads built on AMD’s proven-winner Zen 3 platform brings a base clock speed of 3.8GHz which can be boosted all the way to 4.8GHz. It’s loaded with 32MB of L3 cache and 4MB of L2, with PCIe 4.0 support, DDR4-3200 memory compatibility, and — very important for a chip that’s going to get a ton of overclocking — AMD’s Wraith Prism cooler to prevent heat-related failure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Second Life</h2>
<p>If you’re building your own rig from scratch, the 5800XT is a solid midrange choice to build around, and this Amazon deal makes its price virtually unbeatable. You’ll be saving hundreds of dollars by skipping the next-gen chip and still enjoying power and speed suitable for online gaming.</p>
<p>The ideal shopper for this deal, however, might be anyone with an older and slower PC who’s caught between gutting out another year or two with a subpar machine, or biting the budgetary bullet and going all-in on an all-new machine. The latter choice could run you well into the high hundreds or even low four figures. But by opting for the 5800XT for just $183 and doing a quick, easy swapout, that older machine probably gains years of new life as a much faster and more efficient gaming rig.</p>



<h2>More Than Gaming</h2>
<p>The 5800XT is listed as a gaming processor, and it definitely lives up to that label. But the 36MB of cache is impressively generous, and the 5800XT also supports DDR4-3200 memory, which means it will be able to transder data with the same great speed it games with. Data access speeds are also well above average, so whatever PC you add the 5800XT to will also be more than capable of being a productivity workhorse or media center for streaming and storage.</p>
<p>PCIe 4.0 compatibility on X570 and B550 motherboards is the final piece if the puzzle for this great Amazon deal on the Ryzen 7 5800XT processor, because it future-proofs your new build or revamped PC by giving it compatibility with next-gen components without forcing you to overspend on an entirely new machine or a next-gen processor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6341/">This deal is the best $187 brain transplant you can perform on an older PC</a>, or the best $187 nerve center around which to build an entirely new machine from scratch.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Bethesda announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-switch-2-edition-announced-so-yes-you-can-play-bethesdas-rpg-yet-another-way-before-elder-scrolls-6">Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition would be arriving on Switch 2</a>, complete with faster load times and enhanced resolution. Along with a gameplay trailer, the developer also shared a playful live-action trailer which focused on Santa's elves getting ready for the festive season.</p>
<p>One of these elves, unfortunately, messes up a bit, and loses Santa's all important list. So, in a bid to save Christmas, another elf suggests giving everyone Skyrim on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. Santa is pleased with this idea, proclaiming "you son of a cup of cocoa", as the elf's speech increases to 27.</p>

<p>Anyway, some online have now suggested that this moment in the live-action Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition Switch 2 trailer is actually a little clue for Elder Scrolls 6. "Speech increased to 27… Elder Scrolls 6 confirmed for 2027?" reads one reply on the trailer. "RELEASE DATE CONFIRMED FOR TES VI    20+27 = 2027 " another exclaims.</p>
<p>Some have since said this theory "isn't too far fetched.. because.. why would they [choose] those numbers in particular for level and speech skill level". Why indeed…?</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself below. Do you think it is teasing a 2027 release date for Elder Scrolls 6?</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls 6 has certainly been a long time coming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">having first been announced back in 2018</a>. Last month, Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off"</a>, though its development is now an "everyday thing". Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Howard didn't rule out the possibility of adapting The Elder Scrolls for TV</a>, though the studio exec added he was "willing to say 'no' for a decade", like he did with Fallout.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2e02f1b572090"><a title="Jaws LRG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e02f1b572090/jaws-lrg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Limited Run Games has announced a <em>very exciting</em> enhanced version of 1987's NES "classic", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/jaws">Jaws</a> - and they've got their signature offering of flashy physical editions ready to devour and everything.</p>
<p>These new physical editions of the game come complete with the 8-bit original, now with modern conveniences such as quick save. But, of course, the star turn is a "massively expanded" Jaws Enhanced Edition that embiggens the adventure to incorporate aspects from four (!) of the Jaws movies, rather than just the good one.</p>
<p>With pre-orders opening on 19th December and ending on 18th January 2026 over on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/jaws-retro-edition-bigger-boat-edition-switch-ps5?variant=44839204585525">official Limited Run Games site</a>, the game is set to be released as part of celebrations "culminating in the 50th anniversary of the blockbuster Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg film, and this time there’s no escape." We'll see about that, chief. We'll also update you folks with a solid release date when we have one.</p>

<p>Originally published by LJN back in 1987, you commandeer a boat (don't worry, it's plenty big enough) in order to hunt down a selection of nasty sea-dwelling enemies, including, of course, that great big rubber shark that terrified audiences so badly back in the days when this writer was still rocking a shark-repellent nappy (bet Batman doesn't have one of those).</p>
<p>Here are some more details on both physical versions that will be up for pre-order, alongside some screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jaws Retro Edition Features:<br></strong>Save Anywhere<br>
Rewind<br>
Achievements/Trophies<br>
Music Player<br>
Gallery</p>
<p><strong>Jaws Enhanced Version Features:</strong><br>
Massively expanded, multi-chapter adventure filled with nods and homages to all four Jaws films<br>
New quests and objectives<br>
New abilities and weapons for your boat and diver alike<br>
More challenging enemies, and more ways to deal with them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard version is $34.99, while $99.99 will get you that bigger boat with a "NES-inspired box", a CD (game) soundtrack, a shark lamp, and a couple of other bits.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the original NES game, the excellent Jeremy Parish (who happens to work at Limited Run these days) covered it in his excellent NES Works series several years ago.</p>

            <p>Reader, I must apologise for the intolerably wholesome nature of RPS of late. My last couple of reviews were of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">a laidback farming sim</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/routine-review">showcase of nostalgic hardware</a>. Glancing down the news feed, I note with outrage that Oisin has recently been writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/match-delightfully-silly-hand-drawn-dogs-in-dogpile-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-take-on-suika-game">Very Good Doggos</a> (being thrown into pits), while Mark has been spilling ink over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">that least offensive of politicians, Keir Starmer</a>. Time to consign Starmer, the doggos, and those fetching Macintosh-me-dos to the waste bin along with my lingering fondness for Dreamcast-era platformers. Let's cleanse our palates of sugar with a post about stinking murderous zealots. For you see, there is now a demo available for Band Of Crusaders, the new tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Polish developers Virtual Alchemy and publishers NCSoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
These aren't the crusaders your great-great-etc grandparents hopefully neither joined nor had to run away from back in the 12th century. They live in a very Witchery France that is being consumed from within by many-armed abominations, towering arch-demons, sigil-ridden cultists and... bandits. 
</p>
<p>
I did get a chuckle out of <a href="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kxu4xg5fx3gi6dwjlgfws5hw/bafkreianzgimybybt7reciurxievyfirm3ltldyada3hpnlelzobqirty4@jpeg">this image</a>'s casual equivocation of the likes of Beelzebub with ordinary human thieves. We all remember that line from Revelations, right? "And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. Also there were some guys in hoods who stole my favourite cow. The crowned beast I can live with tbh, but I'm in the cheesemaking trade and I really needed that cow."
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. You stroll around a real-time overworld in tabletop figurine form, steadily consuming resources and periodically entering your campsite to re-equip your hairy devil-dingers, level them up, and send them off to the infirmary as needed. There are quests with fairly extravagant historical fantasy writing. These take you between cities with trading facilities and a range of smaller locations, such as monasteries. While sallying forth to the latter, you will likely encounter another, opposing figurine, plunging you into a separately loading smaller real-time battlefield, where men in metal hats bellow and belabour each other with clubs and greatswords. Or sickles and pitchforks if that's all you can afford.
</p>

<p>
Thing I like: the impression of a world steadily succumbing to a demon blight. Cities have cult activity bars; I imagine you'll have a hard time buying more grain and furnace parts if the major hubs are totally overrun. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-mode-is-out-now-and-its-got-its-red-hooks-in-me-already">Kingdoms mode in Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, with your party striving to prop up farflung settlements. Thing I'm indifferent on: the real-time combat seems fine, with much seemingly depending on choice of weapon: a sword won't bust up plate armour like a hammer. The weapon categories accompany a pinwheel of unlockables that skew towards roles such as tanking, DPS, etcetera. It's sturdy enough, but nothing mindblowing.
</p><p>
Things I dislike: the repetitive combat barks and the fact that all the French-accented English voice staff sound like hastily recruited exchange students. Also, I don't get the sense that this is particularly mindful of the mayhem associated with real-life Crusades; based on 30 minutes, anyway, it seems pretty free and lemon-squeezy with the "deus vult" stuff that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">has proven popular among the latter-day alt-righteous</a>. The choice of otherworldly opponents can naturally be read as dodging the association with religious pogroms and persecution.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, because I could really go for a horror tactics game that investigates the ugliness of the crusader worldview, and/or leans into the garishness a la Red Hook's work. Perhaps that's where the full version of Band Of Crusaders will take us? It's not impossible. I'm not sure all of my Brothers in Fiend-Bashing are the saintly sort. My hooded advisor gives off a certain brimstone vibe. I don't like the way he looks at my cows. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526570/Band_of_Crusaders/">Steam</a>.

              <p>Jim Ward, sometimes know as James Kevin Ward, was a voice actor and radio host, best known for providing the wonderful voice of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>‘s buffoonish antihero Captain Qwark. It was <a href="https://x.com/StephMillerShow/status/1998881395167604759">announced</a> last night (via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/jim-ward-voice-of-ratchet-and-clanks-captain-qwark-has-passed-away"><em>PushSquare</em></a>)&nbsp;that he has died at the age of 66.</p> <p>Jim Ward was perhaps more recently most recognized as a co-host on the nationally syndicated talk radio program,&nbsp;<em>The Stephanie Miller Show</em>, but to video games players it’s almost certainly Captain Qwark who would first come to mind. The hilarious character, all bravado and little talent, was so deftly performed by Ward such that he was<em>&nbsp;just</em> likable enough to be both a glorious antagonist, then later a hilariously useless ally, across most of the series of games.</p>

 <p>However, Ward was recognizable in so many other games, as well as his many TV and movie roles (especially as Doug Dimmadome and Chet Ubetcha in&nbsp;<em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>). In 1998 he was the voice of Hector LeMans in&nbsp;<em>Grim Fandango</em>, became a regular in multiple <em>Star Wars</em> games, appeared as <em>FEAR</em>‘s Rodney Betters,&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>‘s Belial, as well as roles in&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2</em>, among many dozens of others.</p>

 <p>Ward had retired in 2021, due to a combination of precocious Alzheimer’s and an extremely serious case of covid-19 that had left him paralyzed for months. After a slow recovery from the sickness, he had entirely lost his memory. (Rather wonderfully, despite this, he apparently would still perform voices and entertain his family.) This obviously meant <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/05/12/ratchet-clank-jim-ward/">he was unable to reprise his role</a> for 2021’s <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, where he was replaced by <span data-testid="hero__primary-text">Scott Whyte, but his voice has continued appearing in more recent games such as&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Gold Road</em> expansion and last year’s remaster of <em>The Thing</em>.</span></p> <p>Ward’s death was publicly announced by his former radio colleague Stephanie Miller, who quoted from an email sent to her by Ward’s wife on December 10. “One of the saddest messages I have ever received,” she began, quoting, “<span>Our wonderful ‘voice deity’ as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know? Thanks, Janice.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the saddest messages I have ever received from the amazing Mrs Jim Ward:<br> Our wonderful “voice deity” as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM.

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Free Title Update 4 lands on December 16, 2025, introducing a new Elder Dragon, new equipment, features, events, and more. </p>



<p>Capcom had announced a Monster Hunter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase</a> earlier this week, which was not only going to take us through the details of title update 4 for MH Wilds, but also new information on MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. The showcase was delayed to December 11 due to a tsunami warning in Japan, and is now available as a VOD. </p>

There’s new Armor Transcendence as well, allowing hunters to upgrade their HR 100+ armours even further.</p>

            <p>Annapurna has released another trailer for musical RPG People of Note, giving us a full listen to its big musical number, as well as a fresh look at its turn-based combat.</p>
<p>Yes, this is an RPG with rhythmic turn-based combat and big musical numbers, and I can't wait to play it once it's out.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a corgi shaped like an accordion!</p>

<figcaption>People of Note | Under the Lights Trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81CMqRkjUTM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note was first shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-next-three-games-are-a-turn-based-musical-a-zelda-like-adventure-and-a-puzzle-game-exploring-a-utopian-society">Annapurna's showcase back in September</a> alongside the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>This new trailer gives a deeper look at the game. There's protagonist Cadence singing catchy pop-musical number Under The Lights (its chorus reminds me of Rewrite The Stars from The Greatest Showman), with singer <a href="https://lexxemusic.com/">Lexxe</a> providing vocals. Cadence is on a quest for stardom, apparently, and recruits an ensemble of musicians to back her.</p><p>The trailer description also promises each battle will be "a musical performance with evolving combat conditions and genre-bending mashup attacks". We see glimpses of this in the trailer itself, with rhythmic button presses triggering attacks - though without in-game music it's hard to tell exactly how this will work.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Just look at this little guy! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Annapurna</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also see more of the game's world - a mix of fantasy and cyberpunk presented in colourful animation. It looks like there'll be exploration and puzzle solving along with combat and extensive music videos.</p>
<p>It's looking brilliant and could be the Kpop Demon Hunters of gaming if it takes off on its release next year, across both PC and consoles.</p>
<p>I just hope combat lives up to its potential. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 raised the bar this year for turn-based combat</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-greek-melodrama-fails-to-reach-lofty-expectations">2023's Stray Gods</a> attempted a melodramatic musical but didn't quite deliver on its genre-mixing promise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Hi-Fi Rush, however, proved how intoxicating a musical animated world can be</a>, so let's see if People Of Note follows suit.</p>

<p>Are the upgrades worth it?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption</a> is out now for the Switch 2, delivering an updated version of the acclaimed Wild West romp. We've already provided our own glowing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10 review</a>, but now the lovely chaps at Digital Foundry have gone into even more depth as to what you can expect from a graphical and performance point of view.</p>
<p>Starting off with performance, Red Dead Redemption runs at a mostly stable 60fps, with minor dips present in Armadillo and Blackwater, particularly when playing the <strong>Undead Nightmare</strong> add-on. For the most part, however, you can expect lovely, smooth gameplay with very infrequent interruptions.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the visuals, the game's textures and world design remain pretty much the same as those found on Switch 1. However, while docked, the Switch 2 version utilises DLSS to achieve a much more detailed 1440p resolution from a native 720p. There's much less flickering going on with the foliage, while objects off in the far distance have reduced aliasing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 2D assets such as the in-game map are much more detailed thanks to the higher resolution, while shadows appear slightly more realistic than on the original Switch. There are still a few lingering issues, mind you. Some textures still flicker and pop in slightly, which Digital Foundry notes as "disappointing" given the age of the original game, while shadow quality in handheld mode is noticeably worse when compared to docked.</p>
<p>To be honest, the issues mentioned seem so minor, that it's unlikely to cause any issues for the average player. With a nice boost up to 60fps and much improved resolution thanks to DLSS, it seems Red Dead Redemption on the Switch 2 has proven to be a huge success.</p>

            <guid>1379398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Expression Games has shared a first look at gameplay from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a>, the studio’s large scale multiplayer sequel set to release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/05/hell-let-loose-review-ps-plus-ps5-xbox-series-x/">the WW2 original</a>, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam jumps to 1973 and one of the other most significant wars fought in the 20th century. Much like the original game, two teams of 50 players will fight for supremacy, but this time will be tramping through the jungles, boating up and down rivers and flying over the trees of Vietnam. You can absolutely see the game’s visuals are looking to capture the way that this war was represented in cinema, though I’d hope to see a little more variety in the time of day so it’s not always so sunset-y.</p>
<p>Fresh gameplay additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S next year, but you can check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August. I said, “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the bigger dose of wish fulfilment for war gaming fans. Arguably it is the more difficult conflict to adapt as well, but the team’s plans for how to balance the massively different battle tactics, technology and destructive options might seem to have a great grasp of how to manage this.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-patch-notes/</link>
            <guid>1379389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has published a new update in ARC Raiders, one that addresses some of the most critical concerns players have about the game. In recent weeks, the patches pushed out by Embark Studios have been appreciated, but they’ve been firefighting some pesky issues that have made some player experiences fairly miserable.</p>



<p>The biggest concern has been around the game’s worst players glitching through walls or using ziplines to get out of the map in places, sometimes making them impervious to damage while being able to take down other players.</p>



<p>This patch addresses some of those issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-patch-notes-december-11">ARC Raiders Patch Notes – December 11</h2>



<p>The latest ARC Raiders patch was summarized by Embark Studios <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1999060771125248006">on social media</a>. It’s a small change, but one that might prove to be quite mighty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Time to restart your client, there’s a new update rolling out! </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Removed zipline out-of-bounds exploit on Stella Montis</em></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Patch Cadence Update:</p>



<p>Going forward, updates and store rotations will move to Tuesdays, and will not be on a weekly cadence. With the holidays approaching, the team are taking a much needed break to rest and recover, returning in January with more exciting updates. </p>



<p>We’ll continue to monitor and work on critical issues during this time, but for now… </p>



<p>Get ready for the Cold Snap update next Tuesday, packed with fixes and new content!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to comment about the other outstanding issues under the post, such as the broken Trophies on PlayStation 5, which are preventing some users from hitting 100% completion of the game. In a title where a completionist attitude is front and centre, this is understandably quite irritating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 may be the next big brand new video game announced by Bethesda to be in the works, but Fallout is the franchise the studio is doing the most in right now, Todd Howard has told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 is set to hit Prime Video this month, and while Bethesda has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced-on-fallout-day-here-are-the-contents"><u>a new Fallout: New Vegas bundle</u></a>, there’s no word yet on a Fallout remaster or a Fallout: New Vegas 2 to capitalize on the surge of interest in the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention made during the recent Fallout Day broadcast of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, which some (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remaster-new-vegas-boss-danny-trejo-calls-on-bethesda-to-give-fallout-fans-what-they-really-want"><u>including Danny Trejo!</u></a>) had called on Bethesda to develop. Indeed, there were no new Fallout games announced at all. Find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-2025-everything-announced-live"><u>everything announced during the Fallout Day broadcast here</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Fast forward a year and a half, and IGN had the chance to quiz Todd Howard on all things Fallout, alongside Kevin Beatty, Head of Product for Samsung Gaming, Interactive Experiences, and Emerging Tech (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-prime-videos-fallout-season-1-for-free-from-today-on-samsung-tv-plus">Bethesda and Xbox recently announced a partnership with Amazon and Samsung to stream Season 1 for free on Samsung TV Plus ahead of Season 2</a>). In the interview, Howard remained coy when asked directly about a number of unannounced projects, but did offer a tantalizing tease that should get Fallout fans excited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We started by asking Howard if the explosive success of the Fallout TV show had caused Bethesda to alter its plans for new Fallout games, either creatively or timeline-wise. Howard denied that, saying Bethesda already had a plan for the Fallout games it wanted to make.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, it hasn't,” he replied. “We had a plan for the games we were going to make. The TV show was part obviously of our Fallout plan as far as a franchise. And in a lot of ways, I view it as an entry, as a game entry. Games are one lens into the world, the TV show is another lens into the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The one thing it has led us to do is people are coming back to the games that are already available. So, you're seeing record numbers again back in Fallout 4, from the first season, again, in this season. Fallout 76 obviously is a game that we've continued to update for the last seven years. So that's probably the one where we really see engaged audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, the one thing it's made us do is lean into that. We know that we have an audience there in that game in particular. And the Burning Springs update that just came out, and having Walton Goggins in the game is The Ghoul, just there's some really, really good opportunities there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We then asked Howard if Bethesda being owned by Microsoft had made it likely that the company might partner with, for example, Obsidian, developer of the original Fallout: New Vegas, or Wasteland developer inXile — both of which are Xbox studios — on a new Fallout: New Vegas game while fans wait for Fallout 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, Howard was coy in his response. “We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today,” he said. “I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That cryptic tease at the end will be of interest to The Elder Scrolls fans patiently waiting for The Elder Scrolls 6 to come out. While that game is clearly of a big focus internally at Bethesda, it’s interesting to learn that there’s a lot more going on for Fallout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally on this topic, we asked Howard if the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has seen over 4 million players since it shadow-dropped earlier this year, was a repeatable trick for a Fallout 3 Remastered. Howard once again kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadow drop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible. I love the moment that you find out about a game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard continued: “And I like to think about when somebody presses play, what is in their head? What do they think? What is their expectation? What's their excitement level? What do they think about the thing they're about to play? And so, I like to back up from that moment with how we talk about it, and sometimes there are big gaps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big gaps indeed. The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/arc-raiders-patch-1-6-0-attempts-to-stop-players-going-out-of-bounds/</link>
            <guid>1379368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Embark Studios has released a new patch for ARC Raiders, with this 1.6.0 patch being quite small in comparison to previous updates. The main issue patch 1.6.0 addresses is stopping players from going out of bounds in the Stella Montis map, and various collision issues that hindered players, causing them to fall through the environment or be shot behind walls.</p>
<p>Here are the full ARC Raiders 1.6.0 patch notes:</p>


<ul>
<li>Removed a zipline that allowed players to get out of bounds on Stella Montis.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed collision that allowed players to vault and fall through a wall in Blue Gate.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed material issues that caused multiple objects to not block bullet fire or ARC vision.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a gap in the collision on Spaceport Launch Tower that allowed players to be shot through the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Embark Studios has also announced changes to its patch release schedule, and how often they will be coming. Patch releases and store rotations will be changed to Tuesdays from Thursdays, with the Cold Snap update being the first to come out on a Tuesday. That will release next week. However, the team will be taking some downtime over the Christmas and New Year period, with only critical issues being looked at during that time. Then more regular updates will resume in January.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">review of ARC Raiders</a> a few days ago. Tuffcub said, <em>“Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A box art for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> a few hours ago via the ResetEra board. The leak also includes some information suggesting that it will be a remake of the first installment in the series, originally developed by Core Design and released in 1996. The box art matches Lara Croft's pose in the teaser image <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-tomb-raider-game-announcement-confirmed-for-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared ahead of the planned announcement</a> that will go live during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 event</a> later today.</p>



<p>As officially confirmed by Crystal Dynamics, this game is intended to somehow unify the various Tomb Raider series and the protagonist, Lara Croft, who will be more mature and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confident</a> than in the recent reboot trilogy. It is, however, unclear whether this remake is in addition a brand new title or if it's the main project Crystal Dynamics has been working on.</p>



<p>There are also a few screenshots circulating, but their resolution is so low that even the best upscaling tools cannot make them decent enough to share. Best to wait for the official ones, which will no doubt be available after the TGA announcement.</p>



<p>The new Tomb Raider game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being developed using Epic's Unreal Engine 5</a>, marking a departure from the proprietary Foundation engine used in previous titles. Amazon Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will publish it</a>, and there are rumors that it will <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share the same universe</a> as the upcoming TV series, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a> (and, according to a new rumor, Sigourney Weaver is also in the main cast). </p>



<p>When it comes to game details, we only have <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/">an old rumor</a> that it may be an open world game set in India where Lara Croft can explore the environments with a handy motorcycle. Again, though, we'll have to wait and see if those details were referring to Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis or something else instead.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Over 100 Performance Improvements’ Are Coming To Monster Hunter Wilds Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/</link>
            <guid>1379362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although many of its mechanics mark a set step forward for the franchise, Monster Hunter Wilds hasn't been as well-received as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong>Monster Hunter World</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a>, mostly due to its low challenge level at launch and significant performance issues on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>While the development team addressed the low challenge issue in the past few months, introducing more powerful monsters and Arch-tempered variants with free title updates, performance issues still prevented many from enjoying the game. However, it seems like the time has come for CAPCOM to address the matter finally.</p>



<p>The Ver. 1.0.4.00 update launching on December 16 will implement CPU and GPU optimization across all hardware, applying a variety of improvements such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Applying frame distribution, reviewing collision detection, and reducing the number of simultaneous effects to optimize processing time.</li>



<li>Reducing the overall load by eliminating unnecessary processing.</li>



<li>Implementing over 100 performance improvements for players, monsters, Seikret, Palicoes, NPCs, GUI, effects, gimmicks, and more.</li>
</ul>



<p>The elimination of unnecessary processing, in particular, promises to address the issue that most suspect was behind the most significant performance issues. Shortly after release, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">an in-depth analysis suggested that performance hiccups were related to data streaming to the GPU</strong></a>, as the game likely streamed elements in and decompressed textures aggressively when the camera was in motion, among other factors.</p>



<p>Besides introducing over 100 performance improvements, the next Monster Hunter Wilds title update will also introduce new monster Gogmazios, additional 9★ tempered monsters, a tempered 9★ Rathalos roaming the Scarlet Forest and Oilwell Basin at Hunter Rank 100, balance changes for all weapons, support for new paid cosmetics, and more. All the details on the update can be found on the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.040.00.00.html">official website</a></strong>.</p>



<p>If the game's performance issues are finally fixed across all formats, Monster Hunter Wilds will be in a much better state than at launch later this month. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>more players will consider returning to the game, as producer Yuya Tokuda hopes.</strong></a></p>

            <p>Publishers and studios who want to show off their games during the main show at a Keighleyfest usually have to pay a not small chunk of change for the privilege. According to a fresh report from Kotaku which aims to deliver the latest figures for a couple of different trailer lengths at this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">Game Awards</a>, those handing over the cash are now looking at paying seven figures for a three-minute showing of their game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243">Kotaku</a> cite two sources familiar with 2025's edition of the winter Geoffs who say that three minute trailers at this year's show go for over $1 million. Saving two minutes off that time and going for a 60-second trailer instead can reportedly still set you back up to $450,000.</p>
<p>To compare these against previous rates, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">Esquire</a> wrote in June 2024 that trailer prices for the main show of that year's Summer Game Fest were as follows: $250,000 for a minute, $350,000 for a minute and 30 seconds, $450,000 for two minutes, and $550,000 for two and a half minutes. 2023's summer Geoffs were reported to have run the same pricing tiers.</p>
<p>So, having a presence at the front and centre of these sorts of showcases often remains costly. Though, <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">Kotaku</a> did report having heard from that certain smaller game makers may get free airtime. These are called "earned editorial placements". They're not just for the little guys - Kotaku suggest that big reveals from major publishers like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft may also qualify. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-costs-of-exhibiting-at-a-video-game-convention-1">As ever with shows like these</a>, companies may also pay to run a booth on the show floor.</p>
<p>Outside of that, Kotaku's latest piece outlines the costs a nominated developer can face simply getting devs to the show, if they wish to bring more than the two people who're reportedly offered complimentary attendance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> devs Sandfall Interactive have paid for a number of extra tickets at around $300 each this year, it's claimed. Meanwhile, a freelance narrative writer who worked on a game nominated this year, but is no longer under contract with the studio, expressed frustration at the Geoffs' organisers only selling general admission tickets after announcement of the nominations, while apparently neglecting to keep any reserved for developers who can prove they worked on nominated games.</p><p>These sorts of stories continue to fuel debate as to whether the Geoffs do a good enough job of celebrating developers and acknowledging the serious issues an industry decimated by layoffs faces, alongside all of the advertising. Just yesterday, the United Videogame Workers-CWA union hosted their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/videogameworkers.bsky.social/post/3m7olyr5u2k2w">inaugural "avarice awards"</a> on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/UVW_CWA">Twitch</a>, a protest parody of the Game Awards which dished out plaudits like "Most Corporate Speak/Tactless Layoff Announcement", "Worst Crunch Culture", and "Most Studios Closed". Tencent and Microsoft tied for first place in that last one.</p>
<p>The latest edition of the winter Geoffs kick off later today, and we'll have plenty of words to deliver to you about the things that're announced.</p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a> 2 launched from early access in September 2024, its premium edition and content pass promised something no other game in the series had delivered: a singleplayer campaign.</p>
<p>The Times of War DLC would for the first time give you an authored story and set of missions for each faction. Originally announced for release in "Fall 2025", there are players of the series who have waited nearly 20 years for this, and they're still waiting because there's no sign of the DLC yet. Nor Harbinger, the expansion bringing a fourth playable race to Sins of a Solar Empire 2.</p>
<p>"They're definitely still on the road map," development lead Brian Clair tells me, "but we've shifted them around a bit."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Clair and I spoke ahead of Sins of a Solar Empire 2's 1.5 update, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2s-ai-will-now-only-hate-you-if-you-give-it-a-good-reason">overhauls the AI of NPC factions and adds a suite of diplomacy tools</a>. However, it doesn't bring Harbinger or Times of War. "They're both high up on the road map," Clair says. "We've promised this stuff to people who bought the premium edition with the content pass, so we have a duty to deliver."</p><p>The team had "originally planned to do the campaign first," Clair explains, but Stardock will instead work on Harbinger next. "The reason for that is we want to have the fourth faction in the campaign, and it would be really hard to have them in the campaign before we actually had the assets made," Clair says. "It just made logical sense to swap it." Clair says Harbinger is set for release in late 2026, with Times of War now due in 2027.</p>
<p>That's a hefty delay and one that leaves players who have paid money for a DLC potentially waiting three years for its release. Though, signs of Stardock's progress toward the campaign are trickling down into Sins 2. In the Paths to Power DLC, released in March this year, Stardock added scenarios. These mission-driven maps gave players objectives and special victory conditions, something that hadn't appeared in any previous game in the series. "That was actually the foundation for the campaign," Clair says. "We're going to need to use all those systems to make the campaign happen."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>While that may be the first step in building a campaign, there is still a long way to go. Even now, adding a new scenario is a fiddly business. "You fire up VS code, and you're hand writing out the JSON to bring this together," Clair says. "As a developer, I can do it, but it's really going to slow it down." It's much worse for modders. Next year, along with the push to complete Harbinger, Stardock plans "to build a tool to streamline [scenario creation] and not just for us, but so modders can use it too."</p><p>Then, with Times of War, Stardock wants to share the tools it makes to build its campaign, so modders can tell more complex stories than those possible in single scenarios. "What they're going to be getting when we tackle the campaign in full is the ability to bring all those together into a coherent whole and add in more to it, cinematics, custom victory conditions depending on your story path, that kind of thing," Clair says.</p>
<p>Sins has an active modding scene, twisting its real-time space operas into different shapes. Some original, some, er, <a href="https://mod.io/g/sins2/m/sta4-core#description">more Star Trek adjacent</a>. So, while such a long delay is frustrating, the prospect of modders getting their hands on the tools to create their own campaigns alongside all their current tools is an exciting one. Now if only someone were to mod in a Tribble faction, then I could allow my excitement to reach fever pitch.</p>

                <p>It seems telling that Microsoft and Activision haven't been touting sales numbers for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, a sequel that hasn't been as well-received by players as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> was a year earlier. Regardless, Microsoft has announced that the Call of Duty franchise led the charge on Xbox Game Pass in 2025 in two key categories.</p><p>On social media, the official account for Xbox Game Pass noted that Call of Duty ranked first for total players and hours in 2025. Specific figures beyond that weren't included in the announcement.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/xboxgamepass/status/1998878735626567997?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">In addition to #1 in November, <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> closed out 2025 as the #1 franchise on Xbox Game Pass for total players and hours all year 🫡<br>Here’s to <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> &amp; its worldwide community. Season 1 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> + Call of Duty: Warzone is just getting warmed up.</p>  — Xbox Game Pass (@XboxGamePass) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1998878735626567997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The timing is interesting because Activision released a statement of its own earlier this week which acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself</a>. Furthermore, Activision pledged to refrain from any future CoD year-to-year releases that are direct sequels, as Black Ops 6 and 7 were.</p><p>"[We know] that for some of you, the franchise has not met your expectations fully," reads the statement. "To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward ... We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p><p>Despite the mixed message that comes from the close arrival of these statements, it's entirely plausible that Call of Duty was No. 1 on Game Pass despite under-performing in other metrics. At least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-underperforming-in-2025-analyst-says-citing-burnout-creative-decisions-and-ai-slop/1100-6536669/" data-ref-id="1100-6536669">one video game analyst chastised Microsoft</a> for "dropping the ball" and blamed Black Ops 7's disappointing performance on burnout, poor creative decisions, and its use of AI slop.</p><p>The real question now is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-hasnt-been-outsold-by-another-shooter-in-the-us-since-2006/1100-6536492/" data-ref-id="1100-6536492">whether EA's Battlefield 6 will outperform</a> Black Ops 7 in sales. As of early November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">Battlefield 6 sold 10 million copies</a> across all platforms. It remains to be seen if that will be enough to unseat Call of Duty as the top-selling franchise of the year. Call of Duty hasn't been beaten in that category by another shooter since 2006.</p>

                <p>In 2012, programmer Chris Oberth passed away after a career that spanned from the dawn of video games in the late '70s to the PlayStation 2 era. Now, one of Oberth's unfinished games, Xcavator 2025, has been completed and it's slated for a physical release on the console it was originally intended for: the NES.</p><p>The Video Game History Foundation--with the permission and support of Oberth's family--found the source code for Xcavator 2025 in Oberth's development archives. It was originally developed by Incredible Technologies Inc., the company behind the Golden Tee Golf and Big Buck Hunter arcade games. However, it was rejected by publishers in 1991, and it was never seen again until now.</p><p>To finish the game, the VGHF teamed up with Mega Cat Studios, which was guided by the remaining materials to recapture the spirit of Oberth's original vision. Towards that end, Mega Cat Studios' development team only used the tools and environments that would have been available at the time. A standalone trailer for Xcavator 2025 isn't available yet, but the first footage was screened during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition at the 1 hour 43:31 mark below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="6210">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4nCX95t5cWY?start=6210" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The physical release of Xcavator 2025 on a working NES cartridge is being handled by iam8bit. Xcavator 2025 <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/xcavator-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is available for preorder now</a>, and it's going for $100. This game will include an "authentically retro package," as well as a 14-page manual that includes background info on both Oberth and Xcavator 2025. All of the profits from this release will be donated to the Video Game History Foundation, which is an official non-profit organization dedicated to preserving gaming history.</p><p>This isn't the first time that the VGHF has resurrected one of Oberth's lost titles. In 2020, the organization released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lost-nes-game-based-on-a-tom-cruise-classic-has-/1100-6478023/" data-ref-id="1100-6478023">a restored version of Oberth's Days of Thunder NES game</a>, which was based on the 1990 feature film starring Tom Cruise. This was an alternate version that was separate from the Days of Thunder game that was released on the NES, PC, and Amiga. The limited run of Oberth's Days of Thunder sold out quickly, and we wouldn't be shocked if Xcavator 2025 has the same kind of success.</p>
