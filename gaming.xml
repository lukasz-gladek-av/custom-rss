                <p>The layoff process has begun at MindsEye developer Build A Rocket Boy, according to a new report. This follows an absolutely disastrous launch for the studio's first title, which is currently the worst-reviewed game of 2025.</p><p>A source at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> that the company has begun the 45-day consultation process required by UK law prior to layoffs. A specific number of affected developers has not been revealed, but IGN points out that the UK law in question only applies when an employer is going to make 100 or more redundancies at their company within a 90-day period. IGN estimates that Build a Rocket Boy has around 500 employees worldwide, with 300 of them in the UK. Build a Rocket Boy has not publicly commented on the layoffs yet.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, a former Rockstar Games producer and executive who left the studio between the launches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. Benzies founded Build a Rocket Boy and announced a Metaverse-like project called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everywhere-build-a-rocket-boy/" data-ref-id="5000-570874">Everywhere</a> in 2021. Ultimately, MindsEye was the first game to be released by the studio. It's a sci-fi narrative-driven third-person shooter, but was also meant to have a tail of live-service support that would allow both the developers and players to create new content for MindsEye.</p><p>When MindsEye did eventually come out, it was ravaged by customers and reviewers alike. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 38</a> on sister site Metacritic. Players have complained about rampant bugs, performance problems, and design issues. While Build a Rocket Boy has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-outlines-what-its-doing-to-try-to-fix-the-game/1100-6532388/" data-ref-id="1100-6532388">committed to fixing the game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/worst-reviewed-game-of-2025-gets-an-update-to-address-some-of-its-issues/1100-6532547/" data-ref-id="1100-6532547">released an update</a> resolving some issues last week, it looks like it might have fewer people to help do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">GameSpot gave MindsEye a 3/10</a>. "As it is, issues like broken AI and uneven car physics simply exacerbate the problems with its archaic and insipid design," reviewer Richard Wakeling explains. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> teaser comes from an old YouTube channel that longtime fans will remember from Black Ops 2's marketing campaign. The video is only a 14-second teaser, but it's already creating some speculation about Black Ops 7's storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">Twelve years ago, Treyarch and Activision used an entirely separate YouTube channel from the official Call of Duty account to help promote Black Ops 2. Using the "Cordis Die" channel, a brief seven-second clip was posted, which featured a short message from the game's main antagonist, Raul Menendez. The video was titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/__F0okDFRDQ?si=-6VwVPewWBtCeZYs" rel="nofollow ">New World</a>," and while the screen remained black, there was one line of audio. "Come my friends; it's not too late to seek a New World," Menendez said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBF_rFHSCQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chBF_rFHSCQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This was the only video ever shared on the Cordis Die YouTube channel until a few days ago. On June 20, a second video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/chBF_rFHSCQ?si=KPKPfK7t7lKksanT" rel="nofollow ">The Lesson</a>" was posted, and this new teaser features a man standing in front of several TV screens. While we only see the character from the back, it's presumed to be Raul Menendez with a new message. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear," Menendez says.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what does this tease mean for Black Ops 7? Fans are already left speculating if Menendez is going to be an antagonist in the flesh or if he'll be an enemy inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">In the initial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">Black Ops 7 reveal trailer</a>, the story seems to suggest that David Mason might be hallucinating his confrontation with Menendez or is inside of some kind of AI simulation. The new Cordis Die trailer might suggest otherwise, with Menendez watching footage of war and chaos seemingly caused after the events of Black Ops 2's ending.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 had two potential endings, with Menendez either living or dying based on player choice. The canonical ending is supposed to be the player killing the antagonist, so Menendez is likely still dead in Black Ops 7, making the more likely theory that the character is only inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision has described Black Ops 7's story as the "most mind-bending" ever, and teased that the "world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." The game's tagline is also "Embrace the madness."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we won't know the full story until the game releases. Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has passed one million sales, making it the best performing Funcom game ever.</p>
<p>Just 18 days since the early adopter launch, the game has managed to do what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> took a year to achieve. Even now, the game is pulling in roughly 175,000 concurrent player peaks.</p>
<p>In an infographic released alongside the milestone announcement it's been revealed players have been eaten by worms 816,720 times, 628,807 deaths have occurred in the game's endgame PvP Deep Desert, and 121,941 guilds have been formed among other interesting tidbits</p>

<p>The game kicked off to a mighty start and has shown little sign of losing momentum. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record">blasted past 142,000 concurrent players on 10th June following its public release</a>. There's been a little bit of controversy via the PvP Deep Desert, as many players aren't finding the fun in perilous free-for-alls. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">The director initially stood firm on the direction of the endgame</a>, but has earlier today announced plans to expand the PvE portion of this region.</p>
<p>Alongside this future change to the Deep Desert, hints at what future major content updates will look like have also been revealed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">We know every three-to-four months a Hagga-Basin-style map should be added</a>, which should do wonders for the crowd who like popping back in to play every once in a while.</p>

		<p>Virtual reality superbike sim VRider SBK is coming to PSVR 2 this week on the 27th June. This is an upgraded and enhanced version of the game already available on Meta Quest and Pico standalone platforms, and is also coming to to SteamVR sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="VRider SBK - Release Date Announcement Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OASWt2XLsMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>VRiders SBK does what it says on the tin, translating superbike racing into VR, having your twist and tilt your hands and arms while embodying a racer. This is intended to be a ‘simcade’ experience, making the most of the Superbike World Championship license.</p>
<p>The game features 14 real-world tracks, now including Cremona and Estoril, and lets you race on five bikes from Ducati, BMW, Kawasaki, Honda, and Yamaha. In addition to a solo Tournament mode and Ghost races against the clock.</p>
<p>With the PSVR 2 version of the game compared to the standalone headset game, Funny Tales has been able to improve the bike modelling, animate the skybox, feature more realistic tarmac, animated crowds, greater trackside detail and more. Additionally, there can be up to 22 AI racers on track in single-player.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart world 'bug'" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a026f2d866e19/mario-kart-world-bug.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst most of us gamers will make do with cheering loudly to ourselves when we (accidentally) come first in an online race in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, or <em>maybe</em> have an extra spoon of delicious Gamer Gruel™ as a reward for getting gold in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-unlock-mirror-mode">Mirror Mode</a>, some others prefer to...well, they prefer to break things then call 'em broken. A damn fine tradition.</p>
<p>And so it is with the clip you can see below, showing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-ConcentrationC/">Icy-ConcentrationC</a> managing to bug the game out in a fun way, by using the rewind feature to line up a very specific jump off the game's Mario Circuit track via safety barriers located on one of the main stadium's turns.</p>
<p>The result is fairly spectacular as these things go:</p>

<p>To break things down, jumping into Free Roam mode, they've used a mushroom to boost across the dirt trap in front of the barriers, then combined that with a jump boost from the top of the barrier with a feather jump at the apex of the boost. This sequence, it seems, breaks you free of gravity for a while (at least if you're Rosalina riding a pipe-framed kart doing exactly what the video shows) and results in a very floaty princess indeed.</p>
<p>Of course, while the poster suggests the game is broken, this is very much a case of pushing and prodding in a specific way to force a problem, rather than any sort of real or problematic bug, per see.</p>
<p>Indeed, this very writer has just spent a few moments trying this stunt in the game and, alas, isn't skilled enough to make it work, apparently. But please do let us know if you can do it as is shown above!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=9">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, MindsEye, has reportedly begun the process of enacting mass layoffs, which could impact at least 100 employees.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN</a>, a source tells them that it's unclear how many employees will be let go, but the studio began a 45-day consultation period today, on June 23.</p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy has a main studio based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation">UK law</a>, the 45-day consultation begins when a company plans "<em>100 or more redundancies.</em>" IGN adds that Build a Rocket Boy has approximately 300 employees in the UK and another 200 outside the UK. If only 100 people are let go, that's still one-fifth of the studio gone.</p>
<p>To say that MindsEye's launch has gone badly would be an understatement. There were a number of signs before the game launched that things wouldn't be great, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">unenthusiastic previews from content creators</a>, negative <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current staff that described a studio with deep internal turmoil, claims from one of the co-chief executive officers that there was someone paying people to <em>"<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">trash the game and the</a></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"> <em>studio</em>,"</a> and two seemingly prescient <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">chief executives who departed the studio a week before</a> the game launched.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game were out ahead of launch</a>, with retail stores breaking MindsEye's street date, and Build a Rocket Boy releasing a statement warning players that those copies were missing "<em>a major</em>" day-one patch, though it wasn't exactly convincing that the patch would fix the issues MindsEye has.</p>
<p>All of this made it no surprise that when MindsEye did eventually launch on June 10, it did so in a broken state. High-end PCs struggled to run the game at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">due to its technical issues</a>, while players on PS5<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/"> began requesting (and getting) refunds from PlayStation</a> due to the game's poor performance and false advertising, as it was claimed ahead of launch that MindsEye would run at 60 FPS on PS5 Pro. On all consoles, MindsEye is currently capped at 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Two days after the official launch date, the studio published a statement that it was "<em>heartbroken</em>" with how the launch had gone, seeing all the issues players were<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1lgs7j6/even_more_awful_hilarious_and_absolutely/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"> reporting</a> and the negative feedback the game had received. It promised a series of fixes, two of which have already been released, though even after those hotfixes went live, the technical testing wizards at Digital Foundry reported that MindsEye has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">"<em>abject technical performance</em>,"</a> even with the latest patch.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - How Bad Does It Get? - PS5/Pro/Xbox Series X|S DF Tech Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fw_hsVgdfE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy has yet to comment on the layoff reports, or release a new statement beyond its latest hotfix last week. The studio did also deny that it was <a href="https://x.com/buildarocketboy/status/1935040621124972727">using bots to reply positively to negative reviews</a>, a claim that was brought up after a few people online noticed some similar wording in posts claiming that MindsEye gave players <a href="https://x.com/MckKirk/status/1934880019353928189">"<em>goosebumps,</em>"</a> or that they had<a href="https://x.com/MikeChannell/status/1934689743574344094"> only experienced a few bugs, and that the game reminded them of Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear where MindsEye sits in the sales charts, but with layoffs already on the table, it's likely that it underperformed, to say the least, which brings into question whether Build a Rocket Boy will deliver on any of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">post-launch plans for MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's poor launch also brings into question what will happen with what was supposed to be Build a Rocket Boy's flagship product, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/">Everywhere</a>. MindsEye was originally billed as a premium experience players <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/">could play within Everywhere</a>, which itself is meant to be this massive platform through which players could make their own creations and play games made by Build a Rocket Boy, similar to what Epic has built with Fortnite.</p>
<p>That plan was later changed, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hitman-maker-io-interactive-teams-with-build-a-rocket-boy-to-publish-mindseye/">MindsEye being a standalone release</a>, and Build a Rocket Boy having to put out a statement that Everywhere had not been "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/"><em>abandoned</em></a>." Now, however, it could likely be abandoned, since we don't even know if Build a Rocket Boy will be around long enough to make it.</p>
<p>This is just speculation, but it seems like MindsEye was meant to be a sort of proof-of-concept for the creation platform that Build a Rocket Boy envisioned Everywhere to be. If MindsEye had been a massive success, that would be the foundation for building out Everywhere, and the ultimate showcase for what's possible in the platform Build a Rocket Boy were creating. You could say MindsEye's success was meant to be the fuel for the rocket that would be Everywhere.</p>
<p>If that was the plan, it seems fair to say that it has failed, at least for now. Who knows, this could still potentially be the beginning of MindsEye's own arc where Build a Rocket Boy patches it into an entirely different game, something that players actually like and want to play.</p>
<p>Or, these layoffs, should they be confirmed, could be the beginning of the story players are more familiar with, the one where, within a year's time, Build a Rocket Boy is another shuttered studio.</p>

The drama-fueled, high-stakes thriller ends just before the biggest <em>Star Wars</em> battles kick off in<em> Rogue One </em>and <em>A New Hope</em>. A true feeling of catharsis to the galactic conflict only existed off screen, leaving fans looking for ways to reenact the showdowns for which <em>Andor</em> lays the groundwork.<br></p><p>It helped that one of the show’s actors, Muhannad Ben Amor, used the spotlight to share his <em>Battlefront 2</em> love in an Instagram story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that subsequently went viral</a></span>. He said he played almost 500 hours of the game when he was younger (he was only 12 when it released) and called for a sequel.  “Grew up with <em>Battlefront 2</em>—been a veteran since day one,” Amor said. “Let’s HOPE <em>Battlefront 3</em> happens.” He wasn’t the only one trying to manifest <em>Battlefront</em>’s return on social media. </p><p>The Reels and TikTok algorithms were full of <em>Star Wars </em>memes after <em>Andor</em> wrapped, and they instantly became a pipeline to nostalgia-bait of people playing and talking about <em>Battlefront 2</em> like it was a lost treasure from a bygone era. The flood of content was a mix of players reliving the game’s greatest hits, like transforming into Yoda or Darth Vader and demolishing opponents on the battlefield, or putting life on hold to finish Supremacy matches like school had just let out for the summer  in the late, pre-pandemic 2010s.</p><p>Social media platforms convincing you that everyone else is doing a thing can be a powerful incentive. FOMO is a hell of a drug. It also helps that<em> Battlefront 2 </em>is currently dirt cheap.

But with that controversy no longer shading every aspect of the conversation around the game, the parts of <em>Battlefront 2</em> that were fun have been able to shine more than ever. Unburdened by the hype and new release expectations of a $60 game, <em>Battlefront 2</em> can just be that multiplayer distraction that hits all of the <em>Star Wars</em> fanservice sweet spots. <em>Battlefront 3</em> might never happen, but the dream of one has never been more alive. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>According to Varnell, the skill trees are so varied that players could take the same character and action skill into a fight and still be able to fulfill different roles in a firefight. This is a big departure from Borderlands 3, where action skills were generally tied to certain playstyles and didn't offer much room for improvisation.</p><p>As for the overall numbers, players could be looking at a very in-depth system for all the skills they can play around with. For example, Borderlands 2 had up to 10 skills per skill tree for each character, while Borderlands 3 offered four skill trees and up to 20 skills for each one across various tiers. A lot of these skills focused on buffing characters when certain actions were performed, with reduced ability cooldowns, rapid healing, and action-skill enhancements being offered for the right build.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with the standard version of the game priced at $70. A Switch 2 version is also coming at a later date.</p><p>"This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p>

<p>The report, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">written by IGN</a>, states the developer has informed staff the redundancy process has begun, with sources claiming over 100 employees could be impacted.</p>
<p>A source who wished to remain anonymous told IGN the 45-day consultation process had begun, which according to UK law kicks into effect when over 100 layoffs are planned within a 90-day window.</p>

<p>This news comes after a launch which disappointed many eager fans waiting to play the game that had, originally, been touted as a rival to Grand Theft Auto. The game, since its release, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">plagued with bugs, performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-crashes-caused-by-a-memory-leak-developer-says-as-it-remains-committed-to-ensuring-all-players-have-a-great-experience">crashes</a>, and what many have called 'dated design'. Right now MindsEye is rated Mostly Negative on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">though a hotfix has been released</a> to improve the game for those still eager to give it a try. However, even after the patch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">things are still far from perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though the publisher of MindsEye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief when asked by IGN</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane wrote: "although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic has announced their 2025 Digital Showcase will take place on 1st August, featuring a bunch of the games that will be featured, and potentially teasing more about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">the upcoming Darksiders project</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="THQ Nordic | Save The Date 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-UWm3y-ndc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Included in the trailer were clips of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/reanimal-revealed-by-the-makers-of-little-nightmares-tarsier/">Reanimal</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/wreckreations-new-trailer-is-all-about-building-tracks-racing-together/">Wreckreation</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/wreckfest-2-content-update-1-brings-tracks-cars-patch-notes/">Wreckfest 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/see-the-first-gameplay-trailer-for-titan-quest-2/">Titan Quest II</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/the-eternal-life-of-goldman-is-a-platformer-with-a-wonderful-ligne-claire-art-style/">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/is-the-gothic-1-remake-a-gothic-revival-or-a-gothic-ruin/">Gothic’s remake</a>, and maybe one or two more that I missed.</p>
<p>OK, so it doesn’t seem that Darksiders is included in the trailer itself – the dark fantasy imagery would be more Titan Quest II – but they do tell everyone to “saddle your horses” in the trailer blurb. You know who rides horses? The four horsemen, of course.</p>
<p>“This year’s showcase promises a feast of world premiere announcements, fresh updates on previously announced titles, and a few surprises we didn’t hint at already… or did we?” the company writes.</p>

<p>The stream will kick off<span dir="auto"> Friday 1st August 1st &nbsp;at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT / 8:00 PM BST / </span><span dir="auto">21:00</span><span dir="auto"> CEST / 10:00 PM EEST.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry, we're not done yet, CD Projekt has said about a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update that also represents that same phrase, it being about the third patch to be labelled the final one the game'll be getting. Update 2.3 was originally set to be dropping on this week, but now it's been delayed so the devs can make it about the same size as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're probably adding more stuff to the pile of new things we never thought Cyberpunk'd still be getting at this stage. We're multiple encores deep in the Samurai gig at this point, but hey, the crowd's still having a great time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We initially hoped to put Update 2.3 in your hands on June 26th," the studio wrote in a post addressed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SX5CJ2hN_c">choom nation</a>, "However, we'll need some more time to make sure we're happy with it — we're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2. We'll update you further as soon as we can!"</p>
<p>So, no new details about what to expect in this next patch, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-it-turns-out-cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-one-more-update-after-all-and-its-not-too-far-away">was announced</a> alongside Cyberpunk making its debut on a certain new console made by a company often associated with the profession you enlist if your loo's clogged. Well, aside from the fact it's apparently going to about as beefy as its predecessor, the previous holder of the 'last Cyberpunk patch, for realsies' title.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, an infectious digital virus can be a good thing, like when your brainrot spreads to all your friends’ video game consoles and they finally play a game you’ve been yelling about for a decade. Last week, after the previews went up for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a></span>, I looked on my shelf for my copy of <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>, the excellent, underrated 2016 RPG that marries monster-taming and a detective serial story. I was devastated to see that I no longer had the game, so I went to PlayStation Network to buy it there, only to find Bandai Namco had apparently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-appears-to-have-been-delisted-in-north-america/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-appears-to-have-been-delisted-in-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delisted the game from PlayStation’s online stores in 2018</a></span>! Thankfully, it’s been ported to PC and Switch, and I found the Switch <em>Complete Edition</em> that contains both the base game and its parallel story follow-up, <em>Hacker’s Memory, </em>was on sale <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V42555Q?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07V42555Q" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">on Amazon</a></span> for $25, which is half off. Now I’m infecting all my friends with my same brainrot by gifting them copies, and others have been joining in on the collective playthrough because FOMO is a powerful influence. Even better, the <em>Complete Edition</em> is currently on sale for $4.49 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-complete-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-complete-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">through Fanatical</a></span>.

Though the game is built upon the same mythology as the rest of the series, <em>Cyber Sleuth </em>is a standalone story that anyone can enjoy. Admittedly, the turn-based battles are pretty rote (<em>Time Stranger </em>is a pretty big improvement, based on what I played at Summer Game Fest), but their simplicity means they don’t get in the way of the real meat: the detective story and dense monster-taming mechanics.</p><p>Even if you’re not looking for a critter collectathon, <em>Cyber Sleuth</em>’s biggest draw is its <em>Persona</em>-esque vibes and its elaborate mystery. As the title suggests, you play as a digital detective who is investigating a virtual reality world called EDEN, where users are logging in and ending up in a comatose state in the real world. The titular digital monsters are also running rampant through the program, and as the lines between real and digital begin to blur, it’s up to you and your friends to get to the bottom of the calamity that threatens both worlds. It’s got a lot of moving parts, but it all comes together in a really satisfying fashion by the end of its roughly 50-hour run.</p><p><em>Hacker’s Memory</em>, meanwhile, is a parallel story that follows a hacker who is dealing with all this nonsense from a different perspective, and is best played after <em>Cyber Sleuth,</em> as its story overlaps with the original. It’s another 50 hours or so of digital detective work, and while it’s not quite as impactful, it’s still a great, meaty addition to a game that deserves more players. With sales this cheap and <em>Time Stranger </em>on the way, there’s never been a better time to give one of the best <em>Digimon </em>games a shot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'd get it if you're all sick of hearing about New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, but a bunch of New Yorkers run this site and we're all pretty invested in it! It's also broken local containment, not just because <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the candidates</a> is <a href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very online</a>, but because the race itself presents an opportunity for all of us to rethink how we participate in electoral politics.</p><p>A poll <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5363214-cuomo-mamdani-ny-mayoral-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this morning</a> suggests a tighter-than-ever race between frontrunners Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, with Mamdani coming out on top once you account for the intricacies of ranked choice voting. NYC adopted ranked choice voting in 2021, when it didn't go so well: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/30/1011747612/the-human-error-thats-snarling-the-new-york-city-mayors-race" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">errors</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_New_York_City_Democratic_mayoral_primary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign implosions</a> snarled the process and ultimately led to Eric Adams coming out on top. This time around, candidates have been slow to work together but ultimately done so, most notably with candidates Brad Lander and Mamdani <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/13/mamdani-lander-cross-endorsing-mayor-00405357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endorsing</a> each other through a message most of the Democratic candidates have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/opponents-left-are-banding-together-try-stop-andrew-cuomo-new-york-cit-rcna212967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rallied</a> around: don't rank Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>To that end, game designer and former New Yorker Robert Yang has released a free browser game called <em><a href="https://radiatoryang.itch.io/cuomo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't Rank Cuomo</a></em>, where players click their way through changing versions of NYC ballots in an effort not to click on Cuomo's name. Yang writes, "why should New Yorkers have all the fun?&nbsp;Now through the timeless magic of video games, anyone can&nbsp;don't rank Cuomo!" The game quickly gets tricky, with entries not in English or ballot positions that swiftly move around, all with a time limit to ramp up the pressure. Despite this, it's pretty forgiving, giving you opportunities to try again if you mis-click or run out of time.</p><p>Yang wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3lsa4bx2frs2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that the mods of the "NYC" reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1lhmn09/hey_i_made_a_free_little_web_browser_game_for_new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted a link</a> to the game, which is very funny but also coincidentally highlights how contentious this race has been. The <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2025/06/pro-cuomo-pac-responsible-nearly-half-all-outside-spending-across-all-nyc-primary-elections-year/406209/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monied Cuomo camp</a> has gone on a campaign to discredit Mamdani, who has the best chance of taking him on, while everyone else has been <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/cuomo-opponents-remind-new-yorkers-sexual-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperately trying to remind voters</a> that, whoever you favor, you don't have to rank Cuomo just because you've heard his name before.  </p><p>Through how frequently Cuomo's name slipped under my mouse cursor, Yang's game points to how hard Cuomo is working to make New Yorkers feel like they have to vote for him. But the game also highlights the way in which NYC's ranked choice system gives voters more options than just "vote for a bad guy" or "stay home." More than just hoping your preferred candidate wins, you can use your ranked choice ballot to actively cast a vote <em>against</em> a candidate you dislike. Our political system can look like more than just sighing heavily and holding our noses. If you're in NYC, Tuesday's primary is a small chance to put a different system into action. </p><p>Both <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/andrew-cuomo-fight-and-deliver-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuomo</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/03/eric-adams-reelection-independent-00267865?ref=fast-politics.ghost.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Adams</a> will likely end up on November's mayoral ballot regardless of how Tuesday's primary goes, though the <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/03/working-families-party-general-election-candidate-mayor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Working Families Party</a> has plans to challenge them there too. So whatever happens Tuesday, things are far from decided. If you're in NYC and haven't voted yet, please (safely) brave tomorrow's heat to do so, and encourage those you know to do so too. And if you aren't a New Yorker, you can live our horrors, but also our joys, vicariously through a video game from the comfort of your computer.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siivagunner-youtube-channel-high-quality-rips"><h3>SiIvaGunner Is An Elaborate Game Music Joke Collective And One Of The Best Parts Of YouTube</h3></a><p>SiIvagunner started as YouTube elaborate in-joke about game music on YouTube and has evolved into a volunteer, Discord-managed democratic artist collective.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-update-scylla-sirens-new-song"><h3>New Scylla Songs!</h3></a><p>"Now we've got you in our tentacles"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Shadow Labyrinth is an enigma.</p><p>It should be simple enough to describe: It's a "2D action exploration &amp; combat platformer," or "2DAECP"--which is Bandai's Namco official description and its way of saying "metroidvania" without mentioning a word made by combining two rival games' names--in which a mysterious amnesiac follows a small yellow robot through a labyrinth of tough battles and tight platforming. Like other games in the genre, the path here is well-trodden; there's side-scrolling exploration across a big map that opens as you unlock new abilities, and lots of enemies to fight along the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shadow Labyrinth Maze Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>What you won't expect, however, is the story Bandai Namco is telling around the Metroi--sorry, 2DAECP--it has devised. It's known that this game directly ties into the Pac-Man-themed episode of Amazon Prime's animated Secret Level series, but it's the rest of the lore that turned my head during a recent virtual preview session. The 2DAECP space is crowded right now, but Bandai Namco may have found a way to rise above the rest with Shadow Labyrinth; you'll just have to brush up on your gaming history.</p><p>Before that, though, let's dig into the meat of what you're going to be doing in the game. My preview gave me access to a portion of combat and platforming challenges, with two boss fights waiting for me at the end. I began, naturally, with the exploration section, which dropped me into an area known as the Land of the Fugitives.</p><p>The core gameplay on offer here in Shadow Labyrinth is standard 2DAECP fare; I had multiple paths to explore, each with their own trials and tribulations, until I found what I was looking for and headed back to where I began. The demo gave me three different branches, each holding the piece to a key I needed to advance, but each also centered on one of three unique challenges: combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving.</p><p>The combat trial was a gauntlet of weird large-headed enemies wielding knives and swords. Shadow Labyrinth's combat is easy to pick up--one button delivers quick sword strikes, the other a more powerful move that briefly depletes a stamina bar--but far from simple to master. These enemies are devious, with some trapping me in a corner and whipping me to death, while others would aim to shoot not where I was standing, but where they predicted I would be; they were about 50/50 in that regard. I found the trial challenging without being frustrating, and it felt great to get through the final wave and get the key piece.</p><p>The environmental puzzle, while fine, didn't leave as much of an impression on me, but the platforming was the most challenging and rewarding part of the whole demo. It feels like the developers put a ton of thought into trying to predict how players would approach each level, and then they designed their obstacles around that, rather than just placing enemies and traps on each stage. This meant I had to strategize, think before moving, and approach each dangerous obstacle with care; the game actively punishes mindless traversal, and that's how a game like this should be.</p><p>I also enjoyed the "D-Line" parts of the stage--or when my traversal turned into a small game of Pac-Man, and I had to travel on lines of light in order to proceed. These provided a welcome shot of variety during exploration, with a chaser of nostalgia for classic Pac-Man gameplay to boot.</p><p>Nostalgia is at the heart of Shadow Labyrinth, and it's here that I'll now address the absolutely bonkers story framing all of the exploration and fighting. As the Amazon Prime show established, the small yellow robot named Puck is trying to escape the world it's trapped in, and he must recruit warriors to do so. I play as Swordsman No. 8, the eighth attempt at escape and victory, and together we explored and fought our way through.</p><p>That's only scratching the surface, though, as there are layers to this tale that I never expected. For example, were you aware, dear reader, that every classic sci-fi game Bandai Namco ever made was part of a <a href="https://ugsf-series.com/en/" rel="nofollow ">single canonical timeline</a>? Before this preview event, I knew nothing of it, but Bandai Namco claims it has always operated on this timeline in secret--the veracity of this claim is up for debate, but damn if it isn't interesting either way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133"></a><figcaption>Meeting the Bosconians.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg"></figure><p>As Shadow Labyrinth sits toward the end of this potentially-decades-old story, it is filled with references and allusions to games that came before it. A few examples:</p><ul><li>The tribe of friendly human characters I encountered are called the Bosconians.</li><li>The queen refers to my character, whose identity is still a mystery at this point, as a Galaxian.</li><li>She also references a potential foe named Emperor Galaga.</li><li>The Pac-Man robot's name, Puck, is a reference to Puck-Man, which was Pac-Man's original name.</li><li>Enemies encountered during the demo included Pookas and Fygars from Dig Dug.</li></ul><p>These are the less overt examples that some may not pick up on, while other references are much more obvious. I fought two different bosses during this demo, one at the end of the exploration part and the second from the specific save file provided by Bandai Namco. Both of them directly referenced a previous Bandai Namco project; first up was G-HOST, a small pink ghost-looking creature stuck to a machine controlling massive hooks that crashed on top of me. Pac-Man is pretty important to the lore, of course, so it's not surprising to see one of his ghostly enemies appear here.</p><p>The other boss, meanwhile, blew the "self-referential" concept wide open. This was a hulking beast of a humanoid monster wearing a distinct Jason Voorhess-esque white mask and named Jen. If your horror bells are ringing, that's because Jen was the damsel-in-distress of the Splatterhouse franchise, and her hero, Rick Taylor, wore a distinct Jason Voorhees-esque white mask as he tore demons and humanoid monsters in twain. Splatterhouse doesn't appear on the timeline I shared earlier, so how deep into the Bandai Namco vault is Shadow Labyrinth planning to go?</p><p>There is no shortage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-metroidvania-games/2900-4005/">metroidvania games</a> out there at the moment--and there are more coming with both Hollow Knight: Silksong and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond set to launch new entries this year. How, then, can a game enter this crowded space and stand out? Bandai Namco may have cracked the code with Shadow Labyrinth: Make the story so incredibly wild that it can't be missed. It helps that the 2DAECP surrounding this bonkers tale is fun and challenging, so you'll be encouraged to keep traveling deeper down this Pac-rabbit hole.</p><p>I didn't know what to expect when dropping into Shadow Labyrinth for this preview event. After my time playing, I still don't know what's coming, and the game is all the more appealing for it.</p>

<p>However, with three days to go before that aforementioned release, CD Projekt has said it needs "more time" to make sure it is totally happy with it.</p>
<p>"We're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2," the Cyberpunk 2077 team <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1937135894978253112">wrote on social media</a>. Thanking the community for its patience, the developer said it will "update [us] further as soon as we can", so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update was released towards the end of last year</a>, and included various new features and quality of life improvements, as well as what the developer teased as "secrets". These, it turns out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">included a little nod to Balatro</a>. I wonder what the team's next update will include…</p>
<p>Rumours that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this month</a>, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>

Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the Switch 2 already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-new-update-will-have-scope-similar-to-22-as-cd-projekt-announces-delay]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With the Switch 2’s launch came <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-exclusive-to-switch-2/">a new library of games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>, Nintendo finally bringing GameCube games to the subscription service in a way that is honestly pretty great. And with a new generation of console has come a new generation of recreation controller from Nintendo, a thoroughly authentic GameCube controller that’s been updated and&nbsp;kitted out with direct support for the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>It honestly looks fantastic, a true GameCube controller in all its multi-coloured glory, and with modern innards it can be wireless without a double AA battery bay, and still have a thick rumble motor. Putting it side-by-side with an original controller, the sticks feel nigh on identical in use, there’s the same internal springy twang from the chunky analogue triggers, but there’s also the tightness of a new controller for things like the D-Pad (which is still small and impractical, but slightly less mushy). It’s very nice.</p>



<p>And for the GameCube library that will gradually grow on Switch Online, it’s perfect. It’s things like having analogue triggers for air braking in F-Zero GX, like having the Y button right next to A so you can boost without employing some bizarre claw grip on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> (or more likely modifying the button layout in the emulator).</p>
<p>But that’s its one and only real use on Nintendo Switch 2. Perhaps the most disappointing thing with this recreated GameCube controller is that controllers have moved on so much in the last 25 years. There’s a standardised form with triggers and shoulder buttons on both sides, with multiple menu and system buttons, with clicking analogue sticks… and the GameCube controller just cannot keep up without some hefty modification.</p>

<p>Nintendo goes halfway. There’s the Switch Home, Capture and the new C button, as well a sneaky little ZL button, all flush and colour matched on the top side of the controller where you can’t normally see them while playing.</p>

<p>That helps with using the Switch 2 system, but not far enough that this is universally compatible with modern games. So many games use stick clicks these days, and this would absolutely affect how the GameCube sticks feel were it implemented here. More annoying is that there’s no – button, which is so commonly used for a game menu or map alongside the + or Start button. That tiny ZL could easily have been made to match the Z button on the right side, as well. Additionally, outside of games that support a traditional game rumble – namely the Switch Online library and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate – the way that HD Rumble is transmitted to controllers is incompatible with this gamepad.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s just as Nintendo said it would be. This is almost exclusively useful for Nintendo Switch Online’s new library of GameCube games, where it will be the best way to play thanks to the quirky face button layout. It’s just less expected when the GameCube pad looks much more like a modern pad, compared to the funky tri-point N64 controller.</p>
<p>And that’s what dramatically shrinks the gamepad’s value, in my opinion. You can find cheap GameCube-like controllers from the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate craze that don’t adhere so strictly to the design and have all the system buttons. Sure, they’re bound to feel cheaper, they’re less accurate to the original design, but they also don’t cost £59, and can be used more properly for more Switch games.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube Controller is a great-feeling recreation of a classic gamepad, furnished with some extra hidden buttons to make it a shade more modern, but it’s too limited to use outside of the Switch Online game library.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6a5af47b64c4/mario-kart-world-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back with the latest look at the UK physical charts, and, what do you know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has found itself in pole position for the third week running.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 biggie may be leading the pack once again, but its supporting cast still follows closely behind it, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> all landing in the top 10. Oh yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is still putting in a strong performance too, moving up to fourth and proving no other pesky series entry will be enough to harm its seemingly endless sales pull.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered</a> makes its chart debut at eighth, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> continues to climb back towards the top 10 ahead of its Switch 2 expansion arriving next month.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>
