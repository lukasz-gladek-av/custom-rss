Following Iris, he also becomes a playable character in Escape segments.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Mizuki Date</strong> (voiced by Corina Boettger in English, Tomoyo Kurosawa in Japanese)</p><p>A sixth-grader who serves as the president of Lemniscate, the talent agency that represents Iris. Her last name used to be Okiura, but after a certain incident, she was adopted by Kaname Date. She possesses incredible physical strength.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Kuruto Ryuki</strong> (voiced by Stephen Fu in English, Atsushi Tamaru in Japanese) / <strong>Tama</strong> (voiced by Anairis Quinones in English, Ai Kakuma in Japanese)</p><p>Ryuki is a reserved and cool-headed investigator newly assigned to ABIS.

He’s also a secret fan of Iris, with a passion that rivals even Ota’s.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_017.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Incorporates Gameplay Mechanics From Previous Installments in the Series</strong></p><p>This installment is set after the events of the first game, <em>AI: The Somnium Files</em>. However, it also incorporates gameplay features that were first introduced in the sequel, <em>AI: The Somnium Files – nirvanA Initiative</em>, which takes place later in the series timeline.</p><p><strong>Investigation: Wink Psync</strong></p><p>Wink Psync is a simplified version of Psyncing used during Investigations to peek into the mind of the person in front of you. By using Wink Psync, you can uncover lies or learn about a person’s worries or hidden secrets when regular conversation yields little results. In this game, it is still an experimental technology used by Kaname Date and Aiba.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Somnium: Key Rules</strong></p><p>In Somnium, you enter the dreams of people involved in a case to uncover hidden truths. Each dream world is governed by a set of Key Rules, or Keys. By deciphering these rules, you can grasp the logic of that world, making it easier to choose <a title="Genres > Action [2,754 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s that lead to the truth. At first, the Keys appear blank, but as you progress, the sentences explaining them gradually fill in. In the early stages, experimentation and trial-and-error are essential for discovering the rules. Later, it becomes crucial to act in accordance with the completed Key Rules.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Nintendo Switch 2 Physical Version</strong></p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 physical version will be released as a game-key card.

<p>The aforementioned 20.1.0 update arrived May 27 and made some notable audio and visual changes to the Switch's interface to bring it more in line with its successor. In particular, Nintendo tweaked the look and color of the Parental Control settings button on the Home screen, as well as changed the sound that plays when launching the Nintendo Switch Online menu.</p><p>The 20.1.0 update also arrived alongside a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/" data-ref-id="1100-6531857">new patch</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>--the first the game has received since 2022. In preparation for Switch 2's launch, the 2.0.7 update "improved the compatibility for multiplayer sessions between Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch."</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 hits stores on June 5. The console itself retails for $450, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> bundle runs for $500. The latter, however, will only be available for a limited time and is set to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-bundle-will-be-discontinued-this-fall/1100-6530950/" data-ref-id="1100-6530950">discontinued in Fall 2025</a>.</p><p>While Switch 2 preorders quickly sold out when they went live back in April, many retailers like Walmart and Target will have in-store and online restocks this week in time for the system's launch. You can read more in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Switch 2 restock guide</a>.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Ver. 20.1.1 Patch Notes</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where some software would not start after updating to system version 20.1.0.</li></ul>

						<h5>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</h5><p><span>May 23rd, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><span>Think of one of your favorite games of all time. Chances are, there’s some passionate team of developers out there trying to make their own experience molded after that same shared love for the game. Trouble is, unless you’re a development studio with the same staffing level as Bethesda or Rockstar, you probably won’t be making the next Elder Scrolls or Grand Theft Auto. Polish studio Questline has tried the impossible with their take on spinning an Arthurian tale with the first-person finesse of Bethesda’s signature RPG series. Does Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon deserve a seat at The Round Table, or is this one folktale best left in history?</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon isn’t the first title from Questline to tell a dark and nearly apocalyptic take on the take of King Arthur and His Knights of his Round Table, but it is certainly the most ambitious. Set in the land of Avalon, Tainted Grail focuses on the bastion of humanity some six hundred years following King Arthur making a pilgrimage to this island of Avalon to escape The Red Death, a plague that slowly cripples and ultimately kills anyone who comes in contact with it. Now, as the legend of King Arthur has been twisted into a horrific facsimile of itself, the tales of the old noble king are instead talked about in hushed whispers and cursing both the king and gods alike for their plight.</span></p>
<p><span>Enter the nameless protagonist, a prisoner of the Red Priests who has been locked away in an island asylum to await the aggressive Red Death to corrupt his body and come to an untimely end. Players are quizzed on the circumstances that led them to the prison by an inquiring guard, with the choices players make leading into a small boost in particular stats. Not are particularly drastic enough to justify starting the adventure over if you don’t like your starting stats, but I did enjoy that answering that your background was that in magics and you would rather burn a tree down than heal someone rewards you with a fireball spell that would last for the opening acts.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>At this point, you’re left to dwell upon your choices and waste away as The Red Death overtakes you. That is, until a prison break leads to the playable hero crossing paths with the soul of King Arthur and taking that kingly power into oneself. Much as the artifacts of The Round Table have been spread across the land, so too have parts of King Arthur’s soul. What could have been a possession by the strongest human of the era is instead conferred upon the player as an immunity to The Red Death and some novel time-slowing mechanics for combat. It’s here that the player is tasked with gathering up a number of artifacts that house parts of King Arthur’s soul, from his trusted Excalibur to his shield and crown.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>One of the hallmarks of Bethesda’s first-person RPG series is that anything can be picked up and most actions have an underlying skill and leveling system underneath. Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon takes these touchstones and simplifies them down without the complexity and nuances that one might expect. Players gain combat proficiency in one of four combat styles each time they land an attack: Unarmed, One-Handed Weapons, Two-Handed Weapons, and Archery. Axes, spears, claymores and the like are all bundled together until the general weapon type and magic is similarly truncated down to a single skill set rather than specializing in a specific school of focus. This was a novel change I rather liked, as this incentivized me to pick up a new weapon whenever possible and not have to worry about getting skilled up in the proficient use of axes just because I was using a wooden club for the first couple hours. And yes, jumping off of cliffs or hopping down the street does help train your athletics.</span></p>
<p><span>Leveling up confers upon the player a single attribute point and a couple of skill points. Attributes are divided up into one of six basic stats and each come with both combat and passive bonuses where it’s worth investing in a wide range of stats instead of hyper focusing on just strength or endurance to become a pack mule. Most decent equipment has a stat requirement to put on, so it’s worth being flexible and throwing a couple of points into a different stat just to put on a fresh pair of pants. Skill points can be freely distributed among any skill tree at any time without needing a stat requirement and instead only require to be purchased in order depending on the skill tree you’re investing in. Scattered throughout Avalon are a number of origin potions which help reset your choices and can help if you suddenly find yourself unable to draw a bow again, such as having your arm chomped off for trying to pet a sleeping crockmaw.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>On paper, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon sounds like it hits the right marks for being a Skyrim-inspired adventure. With a 60-70 hour long campaign, three massive zones to explore, and dozens of side quests with branching paths and choices, what’s not to love? Unfortunately, there’s an awful lot to put on that list, especially on the PlayStation 5 Pro.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During the week or so leadup to the 1.0 launch and finally leaving Early Access, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon had a number of substantial patches that both fixed and broke a great deal. While I didn’t have any particularly save corrupting issues that flat-out blocked my progression, instead I had a number of instances where quest NPCs simply didn’t exist. Perhaps they died in the dead of night during the Wyrdness or to a pack of wolves, or perhaps they simply blipped out of existence when I wasn’t looking. In both of the first two zones, I was soft locked into being unable to progress the adventure by any normal means. Within the first major hub city is a grotesque statue where players must draw Excalibur out to retrieve one of the first pieces of King Arthur’s Soul. The only problem is that there were two factions I could have allied with in order to get information on how to retrieve the mythical blade in one piece. Players can choose between allying with Sir Galahad and Kamelot or the smaller tribal factions; in my case, I came to a stalemate because I killed Sir Galahad for his armor and then the other faction was also hostile and wouldn’t let me speak with words rather than blades.</span></p>

</figure>


<p><span>With both factions essentially stripped of their leadership in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, I essentially crippled my information gathering and was left without a reliable way to secure Excalibur. That is, until some handy experimentation and chugging a whole barrel full of healing potions allowed me to survive long enough to free Excalibur from its resting place on display. Sadly, while this permitted me the opportunity to venture into the second region, I was left with a pile of loose threads and quests left unfinished because of the key NPCs being dead. Similarly, in the second region, one of the NPCs I needed to meet with to finish the main quest in that region simply never showed up for me.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Alas, my fifty-hour playthrough of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</a> ended with a whimper as I could do little more than roam around the two maps I had fully cleared, a world that’s beautiful when you stop to examine the splendor but is interrupted by hitches and slowdown the moment you start walking forward. Perhaps in another few months time once Questline has had the time to patch out the game-crushing bugs, this is one trip to Avalon worth checking out.</span></p>

						<section>
				<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is an ambitious passion project that clearly invokes some of the highlights of Bethesda's signature RPG series while retaining some unique quirks all their own. Unfortunately, the first few steps out of Early Access show that this adventure into Avalon could have used a little more time fending off the Red Death.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Combat that rewards players for switching between playstyles and experimenting with magic
</li><li>Cheeky writing that pokes fun at itself and the genre without veering into meme territory
</li><li>Dozens of weapons with unique enchantments
</li><li>Dual-wield anything
</li><li>A spell that turns people into cheese
</li><li>Open-ended quests that let you ally with different factions, or just carve your own way to glory
</li><li>Fishing</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Overly aggressive autosaving that freezes action to a halt
</li><li>Major performance flaws including repeated crashing, screen tearing, and general poor performance even on PS5 Pro
</li><li>Impossible to view items in the stash without first pulling them back into your inventory (currently a bug that hopefully will get patched out)
</li><li>Critical NPCs either dying or disappearing from the world when you need them most</li>						</ul>

                <p>Dear Villagers is having a publisher sale on Steam. Most of its games (Big Helmet Heroes, The Forgotten City, Gravity Circuit, etc.) are currently being offered at a discounted price. One particular game, however, is being offered for free. For a limited time, players can claim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hellslave/" data-ref-id="5000-530727">Hellslave</a> on Steam and keep it forever. No strings attached.</p><p>Developed by Ars Goetia and released back in 2022, Hellslave is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler that tasks players with saving humanity via a deal with the devil. By using the power granted from worshipping one of six demons, they'll need to subdue the forces of hell. Varying skill trees, turn-based combat, a large post-apocalyptic world map to explore--the game seemingly has all the makings of an interesting RPG. And thanks to this Dear Villagers promotion, it’ll be available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608450/Hellslave/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free</a> until June 16.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt617ejAIf4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gt617ejAIf4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Steam is known for its seasonal and publisher-based sales. What it isn’t known for, at least not to the extent of competing platforms, is free games. So, it’s nice to see a game being offered in this fashion, especially since Ars Goetia announced that Hellslave 2 is coming in 2026; what better way to check out the original Hellslave ahead of its sequel?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season is almost over, but there's still one more big thing left on the schedule before we dive into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">a more traditional summer season</a> of battle royale: the Death Star Sabotage live event! Unlike past Star Wars incursions into Fortnite, which ended with the Empire or First Order just kinda bailing, we're getting a proper wrap-up here that will involve players teaming up to invade the Death Star, which has been looming over the island all season, and presumably blow it up.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fortnite has frequently held ambient live events that took place during battle royale matches, Death Star Sabotage will be the sort of event that's usually reserved for the end of a chapter. We haven't had a live event like this one in the middle of a chapter since the Collision event at the end of Chapter 3 Season 2, almost exactly three years ago. Fittingly, it was what happened during that event that drew Darth Vader to the island in Fortnite's story.</p><p dir="ltr">It won't be long now until we get to take on Emperor Palpatine. Here's what we know.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_is_Fortnite_s_Star_Wars_event__Death_Star_Sabotage_">When is Fortnite's Star Wars event, Death Star Sabotage?</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite's Death Star Sabotage live event will take place on Saturday, June 7 at 2 PM ET / 11 AM PT. It will be its own separate mode in the Discover pane, and will be available to join two hours before the start time, at noon ET / 9 AM PT. It will likely be the only mode available by the time it starts, so it should be hard to miss.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a one-time-only thing, and there won't be any encores, so don't be late! But if you can't make it yourself, there will still be plenty of folks streaming it on Twitch, YouTube, and elsewhere.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Fortnite_s_Star_Wars_event">What to expect from Fortnite's Star Wars event</h2><p dir="ltr">If the event is similar to past ones, it will be a fairly short, scripted, and linear experience, approximately 10-20 minutes long. It'll have interactive elements, and there will be targets to shoot and objectives to complete, but it's not intended to test your skills. Think of it more like an interactive theme park ride.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4505105-fortnitestarwarsfinale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505105" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4505105-fortnitestarwarsfinale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505105"></a><figcaption>Fishstick will apparently have a role to play in taking down the Death Star.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4505105-fortnitestarwarsfinale.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There haven't yet been any leaks about what's in store, but judging by the key art, we'll be seeing some Fortnite characters disguised as stormtroopers, as players fly up to the Death Star to fight the Emperor and disable some shields and/or tractor beams. But that's just a hunch.</p><p dir="ltr">To get a sense of what we're probably in for, check out this replay of the Collision event from June 2022.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3grDht7-kK0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3grDht7-kK0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_happens_after_the_event_ends_">What happens after the event ends?</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite is likely to go offline entirely once the event ends, and will stay that way for about half a day, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">the new season</a> begins on Sunday morning.</p>

While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-26">last week saw some big changes to X and Y promos, alongside Prismatic Evolutions</a>, the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-best-singles-to-chase-and-buy">Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion Destined Rivals</a> will be the focus for most trainers, at least for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's reflected in some of the biggest crashers and climbers of the week for single cards in the new expansion, including some <em>huge</em> changes once again for hotly sought-after chase cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qmn0g6?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3bgd?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ethan's Ho-Oh ex SIR</a>.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/pokemon-tcg-climbers-and-crashers-this-week-june-2-ign-crashers-1748870510773.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most notable crashers since <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw7Jq?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Destined Rivals</a> officially launched over the weekend include <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObMED?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Ariana, down to $38.16</a> and falling from a previous high of $150 (from before the expansion launched).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxeM8?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia's Garchomp ex (Hyper Rare)</a>, which is now just $67.83 (falling from $138.68), alongside its <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAJMm?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret Art rare equivalent for $220.81</a> instead of its previous high of $469.90 before release day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also Arven's Mabosstiff ex, which is down to $31.28 (was $49.99), Team Rocket's Crobat ex, down to around $77.24 right now (previously $120), and finally Yanmega ex for $31.94 instead of $99.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are some big changes compared to the previous highs we saw during the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">expansion's launch week</a>, and we're expecting even more big moves soon as well.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/pokemon-tcg-climbers-and-crashers-this-week-june-2-ign-climbers-1748870527162.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So this is where things get... expensive. While Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex had previously dropped to around $338, it's shot back up and the next best available listing on TCG Player is $523.80. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a huge spike after what was such a great drop (down from $450 previously), so there's some hope it will settle again around $340 again in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Rocket's Moltres ex also recently spiked again to $314.69, after recently dropping to just below $200. It was at a high of over $400 in the build up to release as well, so it could be worth holding out to see where this one sits next week instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other big climbers this week include Ethan's Ho-Oh ex (Secret Rare), up to $250 from a recent low of $145, alongside Team Rocket's Spidops, up to $23.99, and Zamazenta, up to $16.98.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Pokémon Card Sealed Boosters</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> right now. Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it: TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will likely be the case unless you can secure drops on new sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing#:~:text=Destined%20Rivals%20is%20the%20kind,building%20it%20around%20a%20character.">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> fast.</p><p id="revisit-last-week"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Revisit Last Week">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week's crashers and climbers saw Prismatic Evolutions chase cards dropping in price while classic X and Y promos like Venusaur ex, Blastoise ex, and Charizard ex climb high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxejD?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex SIR</a> dropped by 36% since mid-April, which would also mark around the time Prismatic Evolutions reprints started rolling onto store shelves. This alongside the community refusing to pay astronomical prices on Scarlet and Violet chase cards seems to be driving down prices across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7LGY?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> has always been one of the cheaper eeveelutions in Prismatic Evolutions, but seeing a cool 28% drop from $338.69 to $240.98 feels like a half decent plateau, although I would personally put my money on this becoming a sub-$200 card before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Commerce Editor, for IGN.

<p>At this, there appeared to be confusion as one of the hosts replied, "Assassin’s Creed fans out there, you should be aware that there is something going on with Edward [Keyway],” only for the other host to interrupt and ask, "Wait, has that been announced?"</p><p>The host continues, “I think so, I’m pretty sure I saw rumors about it. No, I definitely saw at article about it … So there’s going to be something going on with Edward, and our PVC ⅛ scale statue will reflect that accordingly."</p><p>From the confusion in this exchange, it would suggest that a statue is not being made yet because the character's appearance has been changed in a remake.</p><p>If the remake is coming, it's not clear whether Ubisoft will be announcing it at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">Summer Game Fest</a> as Ubisoft Forward is not taking place this year. The publisher is however confirmed to have an appearance at the PC Gaming Show.</p><p>Rumors of a remake of the 2013 game had been swirling back in 2023, where the project was still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-coming/1100-6515623/" data-ref-id="1100-6515623">reportedly in early development</a>, while Skull and Bones developer Ubisoft Singapore was said to be heavily involved.</p>

In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kyjua5/super_earth_is_under_attack_built_the_lego_super/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> on the Helldivers subreddit, ruralbricks broke down the stats behind the build, which they said took five months of work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lego Super Destroyer is roughly 1:150 scale compared to the ones players command in Helldivers 2, but that doesn't mean the creation is small. It's over 4.5 feet in length, weighs 28 pounds, and consists of over 10,000 individual pieces. The build can even be broken down into five separate components for transport.</p><p dir="ltr">From the name emblazoned on the side (the SES Leviathan of Glory) to the launching Hellpods that can be seen below, the attention to detail in ruralbrick's creation is enough for any Helldiver to salivate over. More behind-the-scenes looks at the Lego Super Destroyer's creation can be seen over on ruralbrick's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ruralbricks/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">While the fan-build won't likely ever become an official Lego product (it's much too large and would be far too expensive to be submitted to <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Ideas</a>), fans in the comments are already asking for instructions on how to build their own. Ruralbricks seems open to the idea of potentially creating a smaller, more manageable version as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps inspired in a small part by ruralbricks' awe-inspiring creation, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-declares-victory-the-battle-of-super-earth-is-won-what-next-for-the-illuminate" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Helldivers recently successfully defended Super Earth's Mega Cities</a> from attack, the latest chapter in Helldivers 2's ongoing multiplayer saga.</p>

			<p>When IO Interactive announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/">official title for Project 007 was 007 First Light</a> and that we'd hear more about it this week, the assumption was that we'd hear more about it during the Summer Game Fest 2025 kick-off event.</p>
<p>That's not the case, it would seem, as <a href="https://x.com/IOInteractive/status/1929599155736900021">IO Interactive has just announced its very first IOI Showcase</a>, which will include "<em>exclusive reveals and information straight from the team</em>" on games in IO Interactive's portfolio, including Build A Rocket Boy's MindsEye, which IO Interactive is publishing.</p>
<p>007 First Light and Hitman: World of Assassination will also be featured in the showcase, which, as of now, seems to only feature information on 007 First Light, MindsEye, and Hitman.</p>
<p><iframe title="IOI Showcase: Official Livestream - June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xh4qGAIrpCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With IO Interactive having its own showcase, it'll be interesting to see what from these games, if anything at all, appears during the Summer Game Fest kick-off livestream. It could be that we get a small trailer for one or two of these titles, and are told to tune into the IOI Showcase after the Summer Game Fest livestream for more.</p>
<p>Or, Keighley's showcase won't feature any of them, and those on the east coast of North America (even worse for those in the UK and Europe) will have to stay up late to hear more about 007 First Light.</p>
<p>And though everyone (myself included) is looking forward to 007 First Light, it'll also be interesting to see more from MindsEye. We recently got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">new trailer and a post-launch roadmap</a> following some less-than-enthusiastic previews, and neither the new trailer nor the roadmap seemed to give the game a positive shot-in-the-arm ahead of its launch next week. If anything, it all just brought up more questions about what this game will really look like when players have it in their hands. Hopefully we get to see a good chunk of gameplay and what that will be like on Friday.</p>

The Godolkin University they find themselves in now is one with a new dean named Cipher (Hamish Linklater of <em>Midnight Mass</em>) who makes his intentions for the Godolkin students very clear. “You are not students.

His new puppet-in-command, Steven Calhoun (David Andrews), declares martial law and nationally deputizes superheroes, making Homelander the true commander-in-chief.

            <title><![CDATA[Finally, A Letterboxd For Wrestling]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/dropkickd-etterboxd-wrestling</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finally-a-letterboxd-for-wrestling.1204938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dropkickd-etterboxd-wrestling<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the day Ric Flair first made his mark on professional wrestling, putting Anum in the&nbsp; figure-four leglock as etched in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, fans only had longtime journalist Dave Meltzer’s fluctuating star ratings to judge the art form. A scale that often bursts past its five-star limit, rewarding wrestlers he fancies for their in-ring flippy moves. But now, the wrestling world finally has its own Letterboxd, called <a href="https://dropkickd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dropkickd</a>, where fans across the international wrestling community can rate, share, create lists, and debate the best and worst matches within the squared circle on their smartphones. Aftermath<em> </em>spoke to the people behind the app to learn how it came to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Dropkickd was co-founded and solely developed by Chicago natives Keni and Julian, who only gave their first names. While Julian takes on a creative leadership role as Dropkickd’s chief content manager, Keni handles the technical side as its chief technical officer and software engineer. According to them, this marks the first time Julian has put his Concordia University graduate degrees in mass communications and business to practical use, while Keni holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science.</p><p>The idea for Dropkickd originated from humble beginnings: Julian’s girlfriend got into wrestling last year and wanted to know if WWE’s Attitude Era was as good as everyone says.</p><p>“We're both early 2000s babies, so we never watched it. And week-to-week, as we watched every episode of Raw and all the pay-per-views, I found myself wanting to rate these events and talk about them,” Julian said. “I didn't find anything that had, like, a big emphasis on the social aspect of things, like a Letterboxd or a backlog. I searched for it, but I couldn't find it. That night, I came to Keni with the idea.”</p><h2>Getting data match-ready and funded</h2><p>According to Keni, Julian approached him with the concept of Dropkickd in February of last year. As Keni recalls, instead of working on the Dropkickd app, the then full-time students immediately began developing their website iteration, which they completed from March to October. A couple of months later, the duo started development of the app, which was launched on the iOS App Store on April 20th and the Google Play Store a week later.&nbsp;</p><p>As with any creative undertaking, Dropkickd came with its fair share of challenges to work out before launch. The biggest hurdle for Keni and Julian was sorting out the scope of their app. After all, there are as many, if not more, wrestling matches as there are films in the world from companies outside of the WWE.&nbsp;</p><p>“On Dropkickd, we need to figure out what happened. Who is on one team? Who’s on the other team? Who won the match? What the match type was. If there was a title on the line. And the problem is that, especially across promotions, there’s no real structure for what a match type even is,” Keni said.</p><p>Users can run through and rate an entire match card for an event, whether it is new or old; they can also click on a wrestler’s profile to read about their backstory, learn their former aliases, and see the number of matches they’ve participated in, their average match ranking, and their overall rank as determined by users. People can also follow and comment on other users’ profiles, contributing to the sense of community that platforms like Twitter and Bluesky have turned into, transforming a pissing contest of tribalism into a space where like-minded individuals can explore each other’s opinions without the need for a “Fed vs everyone else” mindset.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the extensive archival work ahead of them, Keni and Julain encountered a technical issue: not all matches were structured the same way. For instance, some matches aren’t 1v1; sometimes, they involve multi-man matches or handicap matches with tag teams or handicap structures.&nbsp;</p><p>“A big hurdle is definitely the structure of the data,” Keni said. “It's not as easy as if we were to do something like UFC, where it would always be one-on-one. Also, the reporting and storage of the data is few and far between online.”</p><p>From the start, Keni and Julian understood that building a wrestling archive for Dropkickd would be a massive technical challenge—but scaling it as their user base grew was an even bigger hurdle. What began with 4,000 events has now expanded to over 200,000 matches, alongside a growing community that has now reached 5,000. To manage this growth, they’ve continually scaled their database and backend, finding creative ways to integrate decades of wrestling history across multiple promotions.&nbsp;</p><p>“As a team of two with large demands, it only makes sense that up ‘til now we've had automated data collection. We basically picked our favorite wrestling database on the internet, which is <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cagematch</a>, made sure it was OK with all the rules on the website, and then we source all of our match and event data from them,” Keni said.&nbsp;</p><p>To make Dropkickd a rich media platform on par with Letterboxd, the pair linked wrestling events from Cagematch to movies from The Movie Database (TMDb), a community-run alternative to IMDb. This allowed them to incorporate poster art, backdrop media, and event descriptions, enhancing the app’s visual experience. Despite being a two-man tag team, they’ve managed to keep the platform running through automated data collection.&nbsp;</p><p>They also funded the app out of pocket from October to late April this year. Since then, they’ve released two annual in-app subscription tiers, called Pro and Patron. These tiers provide additional profile customization options, including a verification badge, custom backdrops, access to beta features, longer reviews, and unlimited username changes. Pro, being the least expensive option, is available for $14.99 per year, while Patron, at $39.99 per year, unlocks more features, such as being highlighted on the app’s special Patron showcase page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Dropkickd</span></figcaption></figure><h2>App store debut, deciding promotions, and getting put over by WWE’s Drew McIntyre</h2><p>Dropkickd received a lot of word-of-mouth promotion online. For instance, I got a direct message from my friend about the app back in April, containing the message “Snooze or no?” which led me to reply, “lol is this wrestler letterboxd?” and inspired this very blog. Julian recounts that the app launch faced the herculean task of overcoming negative perceptions of the initial Dropkickd website, which was criticized for only including North American wrestling promotions like WWE, AEW, TNA, Ring of Honor, and GCW. In essence, Dropkick had launched with the long-held stigma that WWE had fostered, where only North American promotions existed in the wrestling canon, and therefore, only they mattered.&nbsp;</p><p>“A big thing for us was trying to get rid of that stigma—that Dropkickd was out and that it’s done,” Keni said. “We know for sure that it’s gonna keep moving, increasing, and expanding. We’ve expanded a lot, so the biggest challenge is addressing those stigmas.”&nbsp;</p><p>The app now features more than triple the number of wrestling promotions, adding companies such as New Japan Pro Wrestling, Stardom, Pro Wrestling Noah, CMLL, ChocoPro, DPW, Rev Pro, AAA, DDT, Marigold, Dragon Gate, and All Japan Pro Wrestling.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that helped put Dropkickd over with a broader audience was when WWE wrestler Drew McIntyre made a post on his official Twitter account highlighting the app’s occasionally out-of-pocket list feature to generate some online heat following <a href="https://www.wwe.com/videos/drew-mcintyre-celebrates-his-wrestlemania-win-on-his-phone-wrestlemania-41-sunday-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his win at WrestleMania 41</a> against Damian Priest. In his post, the indignant Scottish wrestler, who made a history of cutting promos about how he’d been screwed out of his championship matches, made a Dropkickd profile under the name “BigD” to chronicle “<a href="https://dropkickd.com/profile/BigD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All the times Drew McIntyre was screwed</a>.” Julian, keeping up with Dropkick’s keywords across every website, said McIntyre’s tweet had him wake up early that Sunday morning, freaking out.</p><p>“Drew is one of my favorite wrestlers in WWE, and at the time of the tweet, I’m pretty sure he was the most talked about wrestler on the platform,” Julian said.</p><p>“I woke up to Julian’s texts about that,” Keni added. “It was screenshots of Drew McIntyre WWE with a verified symbol, and then screenshots of the Dropkickd app. It was one of those things that hits you right away, but also settles in over time. I drove to McDonald’s 30 minutes later, and during my drive, it was still hitting me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Dropkickd has resulted in some pretty funny lists that only wrestling fans could create. While some lists are genuinely helpful, such as a starter list for <a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/snogler-joshi-matches-you-should-check-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stardom matches that folks should check out</a>, <a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/kade-golden-lovers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the history of the Golden Lovers</a>, and the late <a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/ashertrasher-sabu-s-greatest-hits-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabu’s greatest hits</a>, some of my personal favorites are the truly unhinged ones. Ones like “<a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/coopermpunk-fuck-da-hulk-hogan-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fuck da hulk hogan</a>,” “<a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/leanymcmeany-days-that-made-cm-punk-want-to-kill-himself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days that made CM Punk want to kill himself</a>,” “<a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/faye-nights-when-jon-moxley-kissed-a-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nights when Jon Moxley kissed a man</a>,” and one that warrants further exploration, “<a href="https://x.com/daveedosan/status/1919159028128833880?t=CRcuumFL-oBEzsIanXXeNQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matches I watched while my wife had sex in the other room</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Julian and Keni also get a kick out of users’ lists.&nbsp;</p><p>“Dropkickd makes me laugh all the time. I didn't expect that at all. Sometimes I'll be working on it, making changes, and lists will come across that are titled ‘<a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/33andathirdpercent-best-of-logan-paul-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best of Logan Paul</a>.’ I believe the first list of its kind was Kane’s best matches. It was an empty list and it had me dying because I thought it was a problem with the app because there were no posters showing. I was like ‘Oh god, I have to fix this problem.’ I click in, and it’s like, ‘Oh, this list is empty,” Keni said.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s not a format we were expecting,” Julian said. “It's kind of become its own meme.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Then. Now. Forever-Type Shit</h2><p>Wrestling is arguably one of the most challenging professions to enter as a fan. Due to its ongoing soap opera format, many of its storylines span decades, making it difficult to know where to start, let alone find a sense of community online to share your perspective without getting flamed by random people for not knowing its expansive history. After all, there’s only so much a person can do watching retro rewinds from the folks at <a href="https://deadlockpw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadlock podcast</a>, <a href="https://x.com/oswreview?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OSW reviews</a>, or tuning into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsvxBJfTwg&amp;pp=ygUYc3VwZXIgZXllcGF0Y2ggd29sZiBjb2R5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SuperEyepatchWolf’s latest video essay</a> about wrestling being better than the thing you like. Julian and Keni hope Dropkick helps fans, both new and old, not only critique contemporary and retro wrestling but also find a sense of community with one another.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Professional Wrestling is Stupid and Beautiful and I Love it" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQCPj-bGYro?start=15&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One of the ways they are committed to making Dropkickd a more seamless and engaging experience for fans worldwide is through some in-development features. Some of the upcoming features they’ve shared include quarter-star ratings for more precise match reviews, as well as list notes, which allow users to add play-by-play descriptions to curated lists such as “<a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/theonerichardallan-shows-where-nothing-bad-happened-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shows Where Nothing Bad Happened At All</a>” and “<a href="https://dropkickd.com/list/johnnyomega-the-history-of-bullet-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The History of the Bullet Club</a>.” They’re also working to bring the website up to par with the mobile app, bringing the code of the latter to the former, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>As Dropkickd continues to attract an international audience, it is also in the process of addressing language barriers by developing a machine translation feature similar to Twitter’s, allowing users to comfortably post reviews in their native language without feeling pressured to write in English.</p><p>While the app has been solely updated by the two, adding new events with every upcoming wrestling event manually, when asked whether the pair sees a future where they expand and hire, they said they’re satisfied with keeping Dropkickd a two-man operation but would love to hire database maintainers down the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“When I came to Keni, my vision for Dropkickd was for it to be an absolute destination to go to after you watch an event,” Julian said. “Something that every wrestling fan, regardless of whether they only watch Japanese professional wrestling, lucha libre, or WWE, can visit, not only to rate and review matches, but also to interact with other fans.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-nightreign-starter-guide"><h3>What You Should Know Before Starting Elden Ring Nightreign</h3></a><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is condensed and fast paced, so here's some tips from our friends at Big Friendly Guide.</p><div><div><p><span><span>Ryan Gilliam</span><span> and </span></span><span><span>Jeffrey Parkin</span></span></p></div><p><span>May 30, 2025</span></p></div></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract"><h3>Zenimax Union Reaches Tentative Contract With Microsoft</h3></a><p>The QA worker union has been bargaining for nearly two years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-xbox-playstation-exclusivity"><h3>Video Game Consoles Are Dead</h3></a><p>While Nintendo still focuses on console exclusivity, the rest of the video game industry is changing</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> will be one of the most technically demanding releases on the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. But according to CD Projekt Red's VP of Technology Charles Tremblay, bringing the game to the new console wasn't actually as much of a challenge as anticipated.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview, Tremblay discussed porting the ambitious open-world RPG, which began back in the summer of 2023 with a top-secret meeting with Nintendo to discuss its new console. At the early stages, he said a key aim was to "try to figure out if [running Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is] even possible."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Complete CYBERPUNK Timeline Explained!</p>
      </div>
<p>The article notes that an initial struggle was that the Switch 2 has fewer computational cores available than even the last-gen consoles Cyberpunk 2077 had been developed for. But Nintendo's console also benefits from more RAM, as well as modern technologies including Nvidia's DLSS system, and faster read and write speeds with both its bespoke cartridges and the use of new microSD Express cards. When speaking of last-gen console limitations, Tremblay said, "The most difficult problem was the mechanical hard drive, which is one of the things that’s very important not to have.”</p><p>Having previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-is-best-way-to-experience-the-game-on-the-go-says-dev/1100-6531204/" data-ref-id="1100-6531204">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is the "best way to experience the game on the go,"</a> Tremblay also praised the other console's benefits: "I think the experience that we have, that is way different than other platforms, with the gyros, the Joy-Con, the mouse support. I think the whole package in general, I think it's quite good.”</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/" data-ref-id="1100-6530557">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition was announced as a Switch 2 launch title</a>, and it includes the Phantom Liberty expansion that is not available on last-gen platforms. The physical version will also come on the cartridge, unlike games from other third-party publishers that are releasing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/certain-nintendo-switch-2-physical-games-are-game-key-cards-for-downloads/1100-6530576/" data-ref-id="1100-6530576">Game-Key Cards</a>, which do not contain the game but are required to download and play.</p>
