            <p>“The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/republic-of-pirates">Republic Of Pirates</a> was meant to be different…” laments the narration in the opening of the seafaring resource-chain-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, out today with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103470/Republic_of_Pirates/">demo on Steam</a> at time of writing. This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">pirate</a> theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the resource-chaining of it all, I’d like to draw your attention to the naval combat itself, since that’s the feature that makes the best use of the piratey theme. Combat itself is a familiar RTS blow-trader, though with low numbers of units. However, in possibly the most elaborate and pleasing unit bark I’ve ever heard, your ships sing full shanty verses when you select them. They’re not just one bloke in a cupboard with a USB mic and a bottle of Captain Morgan’s either. We’re talking layered harmonies and full-arsed pipemanship. What’s a slight bummer is that this is the most considered and interesting thing about the ships, at least the ones in the opening hours. There’s no real considerations around navigation or facing, although each class of ship does have a hotkey ability. The starting sloop, for example, gets a cone-AEO shot.</p>
<p>After you’ve taken down a ship, you can gather resources from the wreckage, and this is where the bulk of the clicking begins. You make land, you plonk down a port, and this becomes your hub, since you’ll need to connect every other building to the same road network. The basic economy is a circular system. You need workers for resources to build ships, workers who want booze and fish and brothels and the bloody moon on a stick, as per. You provide those, you upgrade your houses, allowing for more complex jobs with different resources to build better ships. Some resources like wood and fish are gathered from the map. Some, like cotton for sails and sugar for booze, you’ll have to plant fields of. Depot workers ease along the supply chain from one link to another. It’s low stress, leaving you more time to enjoy the jaunty and elaborate soundtrack, or gaze upon the very pretty water as it sparkles in the sun, like a glass eye somebody dropped in the toilet.</p>
<p>My own personal enthusiasm for the game can likely be gleaned from the fact that I was planning on writing a chunkier impressions piece, but now reckon I’ve had my fill with the demo. But there’s a silver lining here, since the complexity I’d hoped for not being present has revealed a much lighter and easy-going builder that I imagine some of you might be in the mood for. A freshly plucked pearl from a slightly emaciated oyster, then, and your own opportunity to be the Bastard City mayor you want to see in the world.</p>

			<p>A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing new features as well as PvP and PvE, weapons balance changes and more.</p>
<p>The 1.12, which introduces support for the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, introduces some welcome quality-of-life changes, such as new map functions and new inventory features, such as a new "Recent Items" tab that allows the user to quickly list all recently obtained items. A new big change is the ability to summon the spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle.</p>
<p>Alongside these new features, the latest Elden Ring patch also introduced PvP and PvE balance changes as well as weapons, skills, and Incantations adjustments. General balance adjustments for both PvP and PvE are included in the patch, increasing the speed of certain attacks for Axes, Greataxes, Hammers, Flails, and Reapers, increasing the damage of Whips, and more. Full patch notes can be found on Bandai Namco's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-Patch-112">official website.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion launching later today with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

But if you look over it and give me an estimate there’s a chance I wouldn’t cancel it.”</p><p>Cain said he played the prototype for two hours and asked the development team a number of questions before delivering his verdict to the vice president.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/screenshot-2024-06-20-103741-1718876295567.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tim Cain. Image credit: YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“I said, ‘I’m convinced in 18 months you could have a really good game shipped.’ And he said, ‘huh, could it be done any faster?’ And I was like, 'oh, shoot, I’ve said too long.' I said, ‘well, even if you did a death march crunch I don’t think you could do it faster than 12, and then you’d be shipping something that was unbalanced and buggy, and the team would be destroyed. So I don’t recommend that.’</p><p>“And he said, ‘ok, thanks.’ As we walked out he basically explained any answer over six months was going to result in him having to cancel it, meaning the answer I just gave got the game canceled. But he was going to cancel it anyway. He thought it couldn’t be done in six months, and I just confirmed that to him.”</p><p>According to Cain, the cancelation of Van Buren was, ultimately, about money; Interplay’s dire financial situation meant it simply did not have enough cash to fund more than six months of further development. But fans have always questioned Interplay and then majority owner Titus Interactive management, and the controversial decision to shift focus away from PC games to console games.</p><p>Interplay went on to close down Black Isle Studios and cut its entire staff. The company released console spin-off Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel in 2004 for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, but it was not enough. That same year, Interplay announced a licensing deal with The Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda for future Fallout games, and in 2007, Interplay sold the Fallout IP to Bethesda outright. The rest is history.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/root-the-board-game-buying-guide.906360/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>On its surface, there is no denying the visual appeal of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-review">Root by Leder games</a> with its adorable woodland critters adorning the box and storybook-esque art style. However, under its innocent facade is, in fact, a deep and occasionally cutthroat <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board game game</a> with complex factions to choose from, with each one playing drastically different from the others. Root is a challenging game to learn, with each faction playing differently from one another and there being a lot to keep track of (especially in larger groups). But with its complexity comes depth and avenues for strategy. </p><p>If you just snag the base game of Root, you will know pretty quickly – within a few playthroughs – whether it is a game for you or not. This buyer's guide highlights and goes into detail about all the various ways you can expand and further enrich your Root experience with new factions, mechanics, and ways to play!</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3><div id="155278"><p><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $60.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>60-90 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p>Root was first released back in 2018 and impressed players with its aesthetic that masks its intricate asymmetric gameplay. This base set of Root includes four factions that players can choose from – the Marquise de Cat, the Eyrie Dynasty, the Woodland Alliance, and the lone traveling Vagabond – with varying player counts preferring specific pairings for the best experience. You will need this box in order to take advantage of any of the following additional content, so consider this your starting point.</p><h2>For Those Who Want to Play Alone or Team Up</h2><h3>Root: The Clockwork Expansion 1 &amp; 2</h3><div id="197425"><p><h3>Root: The Clockwork Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents (Clockwork 1 - REQUIRES BASE GAME)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Law of Robotics Instruction Booklet</li><li>12 Priority Markers</li><li>31 Cards (12 Difficulties, 16 Traits, 3 Vagabots)</li><li>4 Faction Boards</li></ul><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $40.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1-4 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>60-90 min.</li><li>Ages 10+</li></ul><div id="197426"><p><h3>Root: The Clockwork Expansion 2</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents (Clockwork 2 - REQUIRES BASE GAME AND ONE OR BOTH OF RIVERFOLK OR UNDERWORLD EXPANSIONS)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Law of Robotics Instruction Booklet</li><li>12 Priority Markers</li><li>47 Cards (12 Difficulties, 20 Traits, 3 Vagabots, 1 Interaction, 11 Services)</li><li>4 Faction Boards</li></ul><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $40.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1-4 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>60-90 min.</li><li>Ages 10+</li></ul><p>If there are any “must have '' expansions for Root, I would argue that it would be the Clockwork Expansions – at least the first one. These special expansions allow you to play Root as either a solo experience or a cooperative one, with the addition of “AI ''-controlled factions. The original Clockwork expansion includes robot versions of the base game’s factions (the Mechanical Marquise 2.0, Electrical Eyrie, Automated Alliance, and the Vagabot),  while the second box includes factions from other expansions (the Logical Lizards, Riverfolk Robots, Cogwheel Corvids, Drillbit Duchy, and additional Vagabot options).</p><h2>For Those Who Want More Faction Options</h2><h3>Root: The Riverfolk Expansion</h3><div id="197428"><p><h3>Root: The Riverfolk Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $40.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1-6 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>90-120 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Factions</li><li>3 New Vagabond Variants</li><li>1 “AI” Controlled Faction</li></ul><p>Lizard cultists and merchant otters have entered the woodlands of Root with the Riverfolk expansion. In addition to the new ways to play Root that both of these groups provide (nothing like some ritual sacrifice and capitalism), this expansion – along with the others that add new factions – increases the possible player count from four to six. The Riverfolk expansion also includes the original version of the Mechanical Marquise, allowing for solo play, but this “AI” faction was revamped and retooled to be better in the Clockwork Expansion.</p><h3>Root: The Underworld Expansion</h3><div id="197430"><p><h3>Root: The Underworld Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>:  $50.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>90-120 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Factions</li><li>1 Double-sided Map Board</li></ul><p>If you thought that things above ground in Root were hectic, just imagine how things are going underground! The Underworld expansion adds in two new factions to the Root mix – the moles of the Underground Duchy and the secretive crows of the Corvid Conspiracy. The Duchy can amass forces like the Marquise while mixing some of the political balancing shtick of the Eyrie, while the crows tend to work from the shadows – much like the Woodland Alliance agents - but with a bit more of a violent twist. Even if you and your players don’t feel like using the new factions, this expansion includes two new maps for you to wage your critter wars in.</p><h3>Root: The Marauder Expansion</h3><div id="197433"><p><h3>Root: The Marauder Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $50.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players (best with 3-4)</li><li>90-120 min.</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Factions</li><li>4 Hirelings</li><li>Advanced Setup cards</li></ul><p>Badger Knight Templars seeking relics and angry rat hordes are what you have to look forward to in the Marauder Expansion with the Keepers in Iron and the Lord of the Hundreds. Whether it is attempting to bring your latest relic back to your keep safely or managing the mood of the Lord of the Rats, both of these factions feel especially unique. Marauders adds two new systems that you can apply to your normal Root games, too – the Advanced Setup rules and Hirelings. For experienced Root players, the  “Advanced Setup” cards will make the game even more of a wild challenge to contend with new options and restrictions. Hirelings provide players with recruitable units – from a faction not present in the game – that have specific actions that can be used. Representative hirelings from the original four base factions (Cats, Birds, Alliance, Vagabond) are included in this box.  </p><h2>Because Root Needed More Mechanics</h2><h3>Marauder Hirelings Pack &amp; Hireling Box</h3><div id="197439"><p><h3>Root: Marauder Hirelings Pack and Hireling Box</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $30.00</p><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Bearer hirelings, Keeper hirelings, Bandit hirelings</li></ul><h3>Riverfolk Hirelings Pack</h3><div id="197436"><p><h3>Root: Riverfolk Hirelings Pack</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $20.00</p><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lizard hirelings, Otter flotilla hireling, Porcupine Bandit hirelings</li></ul><h3>Underworld Hirelings Pack</h3><div id="197438"><p><h3>Root: Underworld Hirelings Pack</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $20.00</p><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mole hirelings, Stag hireling, Crow hirelings</li></ul><p>If you fell in love with the hirelings in the Marauder expansion, then good news: You can get even more of them with these boxes! These various boxes will not only give you representatives from the other factions but brand new ones as well like the Stag and the bandits. If you love the hirelings mechanic, then these are worth adding to your Root collection.</p><h2>Small Packs</h2><h3>Landmarks Pack</h3><div id="197440"><p><h3>Root: Landmarks Pack</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $10.00</p><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Wooden Landmark tokens</li><li>rulebook</li></ul><h3>The Exiles and Partisans Deck</h3><div id="197441"><p><h3>Root: Exiles and Partisans Deck</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $10.00</p><p><strong>Contents:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>54-card deck</li></ul><h3>The Vagabond Pack</h3><div id="197442"><p><h3>Root: The Vagabond Pack</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $10.00</p><p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>7 Wooden Vagabond tokens</li><li>3 new Vagabond types (Harrier, Ronin, Adventurer)</li><li>3 cardboard tokens (coin, hammer, boots)</li></ul><p>These three smaller add-on packs won’t drastically change your Root experience, but if you aren’t in the market to drop much money and still want to change things up with the game, these can add a little spice into the mix for a relatively low cost. The Landmarks pack lets you stop at various places to take advantage of different benefits, such as bartering items or making special items. The Exiles and Partisans deck replaces the default deck that comes with Root and includes some new cards that focus more on persistent effects and more – this pack is a quick and easy way to change things up without having to learn a brand new faction or system. Lastly, for those Vagabond fans out there, the Vagabond pack adds three brand new choices to pick from, in addition to providing you with unique wooden tokens representing each possible option.   </p><h2>Free Packs</h2><h3>The Outsiders Expansion</h3><div id="202225"><p><h3>Root: The Outsiders Expansion</h3></p></div><p>If you're truly dedicated, you can expand your root collection with this free, fan-made expansion that you'll need to downlod, print, and assemble yourself. A guide to doing so is included among the files in the download. For those willing to make the effort a wealth of new material awaits. The main draw is that there are no fewer than six-brand new factions to play with, with a supporting role for a new Vagabond variant, two new maps to play on and a new shared card deck. And if you don't want to go to the effort of pasting up the whole lot, it's modular, so you can pick and choose what you fancy. While it's unlikely to have had the same level of playtesting as official content, the reaction from players has been extremely positive, particularly for the additional maps.</p><h2>For Those Who Can’t Get Enough Root</h2><h3>Root: The RPG</h3><div id="197443"><p><h3>Root: The Tabletop Role-Playing Game</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 (Core Rule Book)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>3-5 Players</li><li>2-4 hours</li></ul><p>If you find yourself in love with the world and factions of Root, you can keep your adventures going with Root: The RPG from Magpie Games. This tabletop RPG will allow you and your friends to create your own furry vagabonds and experience the Woodland in a whole new way! Roll some dice and start exploring.</p><h3>Root (Digital)</h3><div id="197444"><p><h3>Root</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $14.99</p><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/7XNDV" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Wq8bN" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/rwqMP" target="_blank">App Store</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/m3qNv" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></p><p>Having a hard time nailing down your game group to get some in-person Root going? Or do you just feel like testing your skills with players far and wide? Either way, studio Dire Wolf has created a wonderful digital version of Root that lets you play many of your favorite factions locally, online, or against the computer. This digital option is a great way not only to teach the game but also to play with those friends who can’t get away from their house for a game night.</p><p>Currently, all expansions, with the exception of Clockwork 2 and Marauders, are available.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>While Root may not be everyone's cup of Root Tea, there’s a reason that it currently stands at the 30 spot on Board Game Geek’s board game list. It can be time-consuming – and at times confusing – figuring out what the different factions can do, how to counter them, and keeping track of what the other players are doing – but it still has a charm that few other games can match. With plenty of expansions and additional content available, fans have no shortage of woodland adventuring to dive into if you and your game group fall in love with Root.</p><p>Also check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill Buyer's Guide</a>, as well as our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">best 2-player board games</a>, as well as our updated list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games of all time</a>.</p><p><em>Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <p>The games industry is in constant flux; what we think we know today as fact is gone often completely different the next day.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, we used to go to a brick and mortar shop to buy the latest releases; now we can snap them up online and download them to our device without leaving our homes. Developers used to have to partner with publishers for their games to reach market; now they can use digital platforms and release their wares into the world without a middle man. We used to have a dedicated device like a console or PC to play the latest AAA blockbusters, now we can also play these directly on our mobile phone.</p>
<p>Much has changed in the last decade so there’s no reason to believe that how we play games today will be the same ten years from now. At the recent IGN Live, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>head Christopher Dring spoke to some of the smartest minds in the business to see how they feel playing games will change in the future.</p>
<p>For a long time, consoles have been one of the dominant forms of playing games, but the sector has stagnated somewhat, failing to grow and attract new audiences.</p>
<p>Tencent advisor and PlayStation alum Shawn Layden believes that consoles are indeed in trouble, but this isn't anything new.</p>
<p>"If you look at the history of consoles, the global install base in any one of those generations never rose above 250 million," he said. "There was that one point when Wii came out, and thanks to Wii Fit, an extra 20 million units were sold because everyone thought they could lose weight. But that wasn't sustainable and came crashing down and we're still in that 250 million overall install base of active consoles. That's a challenge.</p>
<p>"During the pandemic, revenue rose by 20 or 25%, but we were still getting more money from the same people. It wasn't necessarily bringing new people into the console gaming world. That's the existential threat to gaming right now."</p>
<p>Van Burnham, the author of Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, said that, having spoken to a variety of developers, she believes that an immersive-like Holodeck experience is the Holy Grail for game creators. That kind of technology is a long way off, but she thinks that consoles are going to play a vital role in bringing about that type of an experience at the point where we are capable of creating such things.</p>
<p>"Consoles are going to have to evolve to meet that future,” she said. "Are they going to be able to do that or not? A lot of that has to do with content, with how we make this business more sustainable, with how we foster more creativity and more experimentation in the risk-averse world that we are in, it becomes a little more of a challenge. I'm interested to see how publishers and console manufacturers are going to rise to meet that challenge."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The global install base in any console generation never rose above 250 million. Wii Fit [helped sell] an extra 20 million, but that wasn't sustainable"</p>
<cite>Shawn Layden</cite></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Wedbush Securities analyst and MD Michael Pachter believes that consoles aren't going anywhere. He does, however, predict that each successive generation will be smaller than the last. He added that developers will be able to choose their audience based on the hardware they opt to release games on.</p>
<p>"The best experience will be on a console. There will be a small subset – a couple of hundred million – who play it that way, and there'll be a large subset – three billion – who consume games a different way," he said. "What I think is really interesting is the convergence of the technology, where small screens get really powerful."</p>
<p>He continued: "Microsoft recently announced three new consoles. Two were digital-only with 1TB hard drives. Clearly that's the Game Pass device. What are they trying to do? They're trying to get a PlayStation owner to buy their first Xbox and sign up to Game Pass. It's smart. Business models will evolve but you'll always have a chance to play a game on a console.”</p>
<p>Though platforms like mobile have evolved to the point that consumers can play AAA games such as Assassin's Creed Mirage and Death Stranding on them, the inherent limitations of the hardware mean that consoles are often a more enticing proposition.</p>
<p>"Nothing is going to replace the experience of having an 85 inch 8K OLED and having an experience that's crafted to that, which is a really deep narrative where you can get into your Resident Evil 4 and your Last of Us, these type of really story-driven narrative experiences that make the most of that type of gameplay experience," Burnham said.</p>
<p>"That's what really needs to be focused on in order to differentiate it from PC gaming, which is a totally different experience."</p>
<p>One issue facing the console space is simple economics – AAA games cost much more to make, and thus, success is more precarious and harder to come by.</p>
<p>"Van puts forward a future I agree with, except for the fact that those games are going to cost $400 million to make and they're going to take seven years to get done," Layden said in response to Burnham's comments.</p>
<p>"That is the kind of cash burn and excessive time needed to get the product, which is really going to be an albatross on the console experience if we can't get a greater variety of content out there and because games are [expensive] to make, you don't get a lot of risk-taking."</p>
<p>As a result, the games industry has become more risk-averse. Rather than creating a wide variety of content that serves many different audiences, companies are more likely to stick to known IP and genres.</p>
<p>"We have to lower that entry point to get really high-end content into the community and business at a lower cost point in order to bring more variety," Layden continued. "Nothing was more variable than the PS2 era – from Katamari Damacy to SingStar to Eye Toy. At those development costs, you can make a lot more bets.</p>
<p>"Now we are seeing, sadly, most of the big ones that are coming out fall into well-known genres and categories, with the exception of something like Hi-Fi Rush, which was fresh and new. Almost everything else we're seeing now is pretty much an extension of where we've already been. That's not how you get new people into console gaming. The people who aren't console players now have already told us we're not interested in Fortnite, God of War, you name it. So by continuing to make more of the stuff we've made before, you won't get those people in now. They've already decided they don't want to play Call of Duty. Our lack of variety and the offering of content are some of our biggest risks going forward."</p>

<figcaption>Van Burnham believes attempting to replicate the accidental or organic success of Fortnite or Roblix is "not a viable business model"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While consoles have long been one of the main ways that people play video games, there are always new technologies on the horizon that put forward new ways for people to enjoy their favourite titles. For a long time, streaming threatened to open up games to a wider audience by removing the need for powerful hardware in their home, though to date this promise has largely failed to materialise.</p>
<p>As Layden points out, one major limitation streaming has faced is good, high-speed internet. "If you live in Tokyo, Seoul or Stockholm, you can have a streaming game live right now,” he explained. "If you live in Stockton, Muncie, Indiana or London, England, you can't have a streaming experience."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Nothing is going to replace the experience of having an 85 inch 8K OLED and having an experience that's crafted to that"</p>
<cite>Van Burnham</cite></blockquote>
<p>Burnham had similar thoughts on the matter, pointing to the litany of failures in this new sector, such as OnLive and Stadia.</p>
<p>"The technology is just too far away to make that a really viable platform," she said. "That said, I am very excited to see what Netflix could possibly do with the right direction."</p>
<p>Layden, however, didn't feel that streaming was out of the running. At the moment, most cloud platforms operate purely as delivery and distribution services; but they can also be used to provide powerful hardware remotely to the user.</p>
<p>"[There is also] cloud gaming where you are able to leverage the power of server-side CPU and GPU compute, which will give you more power than your console ever could at a price point you could afford," he said. "Then it becomes kind of interesting. If we make the server side do more of the heavy lifting and provide something that current console technology or even next-gen can't do from cost and maintenance and all that, then maybe you get some more interesting ideas around that."</p>
<p>Wedbush's Pachter said that streaming is going to "absolutely dominate" but does not think that it will ultimately replace consoles.</p>
<p>"We will continue to buy consoles or some very powerful device to play multiplayer because latency matters," he said. "You can absolutely stream single-player RPGs. Who cares how fast your internet connection is; if it buffers, you won't die. I don't think that you'll see Call of Duty multiplayer on streaming ever, but will you see Call of Duty single-player campaign? Trust me, there's a reason Microsoft fought so hard to buy Activision. They want that on Game Pass."</p>
<p>In recent years, we’ve also seen the rise of so-called ‘metaverse’ platforms – virtual worlds where people can gather to do a variety of things, including playing games. So far, Roblox and Fortnite are two of the biggest names in this burgeoning sector, at least on the video games side of things, both allowing players to take part in a variety of experiences. The former allows regular people to make and release games to the platform’s audience, while the latter features a variety of different experiences, including games and even concerts.</p>
<p>Layden feels that while this is an interesting new addition to the industry, it also is not a threat to single-player narrative titles that are beloved by console fans.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I don't think that you'll see Call of Duty multiplayer on streaming ever, but will we see Call of Duty's single-player campaign?"</p>
<cite>Michael Pachter, Wedbush Morgan</cite></blockquote>
<p>Burnham, meanwhile, says that these platforms are an entirely separate category to the rest of the games industry. She believes the success they have seen is not predictable or planned, but rather has been accidental or organic. For example, Fortnite was initially a full price survival game before its swift pivot to battle royale and, later, complete cultural domination.</p>
<p>"Part of the problem is that so many publishers look at the success of those platforms and think they need to do that,” Burnham said. "It's an accident. Will there be more content that will be able to achieve that level of success and find that audience? Maybe. But that's not something you can design. It's something that has to resonate with an audience. It's like lightning in a bottle. Replicating that is not a viable business model.</p>
<p>"A lot of publishers have gotten into trouble trying to chase that when it's not something you can just attain by throwing money at it. It's something that has to happen organically. Will there be other games like that? Absolutely. But I don't think that's something that can exist just as a category. You can't engineer success like that."</p>
<p>While Roblox features a massive number of games, these are all titles built on the platform itself. The company is yet to sell third-party titles, something Pachter says is down to its rather aggressive business model. The firm keeps 70% of revenue from sales – compared to most other game platforms, which retain around 30% – which the analyst said is something Roblox needs to adjust before it can be a meaningful contender to other game platforms.</p>
<p>"They’ll be just like iOS, Android, Xbox or PlayStation," Pachter said. "It won’t be for AAA experiences, but [absolutely perfect for games like] Helldivers or Palworld. I think they're onto something and will figure it out."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/God-of-war-ragnarok_Kk8zhZv.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Layde says that as long as platform holders focus on extensions of what's come before, growth for consoles will be limited</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rounding things off, we asked our panel what the future of playing games looks like. Layden pointed out that Microsoft and Sony used to make machines with very different architectures, but now, they are more or less the same AMD hardware. They are so similar now, that we are talking about small differences in technical issues that most people will not notice.</p>
<p>"We're talking about ray tracing differentials and most of us [don’t have good enough TVs] so can't see the ray tracing anyway," Layden said. "Xbox, PlayStation, high-end PC, that's almost at a plateau where all things being equal, they're pretty much the same. We'd be in a better world if we could get down to one standard home console technology that we could come together, and get this platform war thing out of the way."</p>
<p>Burnham, meanwhile, is more interested in newer kinds of games. "I want to imagine a future where there are more really exciting location-based gaming environments; just like how people still go to the theatre to see a film, people will create some amazing metaverse volumes where you can go and interact in a specific type of world," she said. "But we're going to generally be playing games at home in the environment we have created."</p>
<p>Finally, Pachter believes we are going to be scalable experiences that can be played across a variety of devices.</p>
<p>"It's exactly like the consumption of video entertainment; 100 years ago, no one could have conceived that we'd consume film entertainment outside of a movie theatre and now you can consume it right now on your phone," he said. "I just think that games are going to keep going that way. The experience will be dumbed down for your phone and sped up for your 80-inch LG OLED TV.</p>
<p>"I think we'll play games everywhere."</p>

            <p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">devastating closures at Bethesda</a>, Microsoft has started refunding those who purchased Redfall's premium Bite Back edition.</p>
<p>This edition of Arkane Austin's vampire shooter was set to provide players with the Redfall Hero Pass, which would have added a further two characters to the game. In November, the studio said it was "continuing development of The Hero Pass and we're excited to share more about Redfall's new heroes and other updates later next year".</p>
<p>However, following the studio's closure last month, Arkane Austin confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-cancelled-following-arkane-austin-closure">Hero Pass DLC for Redfall would no longer be released</a>. At this time, the studio said those who had purchased the DLC via either the Bite Back edition or base game upgrade would instead receive credit to the same value as the pass.</p>

<p>Now, a little over a month since these refunds were first announced, Microsoft has begun reimbursing players. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redfall/comments/1djpts6/check_your_emails/">Several people</a> have reported Microsoft has been automatically refunding buyers the full amount of the DLC. This is even if a refund had not been requested.</p>
<p>Others who bought the physical edition of the Bite Back Upgrade said they are still waiting to receive their credit.

</div><div>



            <p>The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soma">Soma</a>, launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/282140/view/5997186379240878314?l=english">the soft toy depiction</a> of the game's protagonist Simon on <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/simon-from-soma-plush">Makeship</a>, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The statue of limitations for spoilers on Soma is long gone (and the appearance of the plushie constitutes a spoiler in itself), so let's remind ourselves why Soma is such a disturbing, philosophical horror. </p>
<p>For much of the game you believe you're a human surrounded by robotic lifeforms. But your character, turns out, is a robot himself. You trundle through the sparking ruins of the leaky subaquatic base transferring your consciousness from one robo-body to another in a creepy copy-and-paste ceremony that lets you reach new areas. But in doing this, you leave a previous copy of yourself stuck. Ah. </p>
<p>Stranded, alone, and terrified, you have to listen to their (your?) horrified screams and pleas as you leave them (you?) behind. At the end of the game, you perform one final transference of consciousness to escape the dying facility. A paradise-like storage space for AI awaits, safety from all the grime and rust and fear you've gone through. Sanctuary, comfort, companionship. The transfer works!</p>
<p>But this time, you're the one left behind. </p>
<p>In this light, I could see why someone might want to cuddle Simon. Not for their own sake, but for his. Soma is a game about abandonment, identity, and what it means to have a body (also, one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>). I definitely didn't play it and think: "Cute!" But at the time of writing over 500 people are willing to pay for an adorable totem of existential isolation, yet more proof that the ambivalent appeal of the cute-horror fusion is real. I can respect that.</p>
<p>Like I say, Frictional Games aren't the first to farm fuzz from phobia. Edwin points out there is a <a href="https://afterthecredits.net/en/collectibles/plushes/800/silent-hill-plush-pyramid-head">plushie of Pyramid Head</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, for example. You can also get the <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/cursed-monkey-paw-plushie">cursed monkey paw</a> from torch-lit terrorizer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>, the <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/goblin-plush-1">goblin guys</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, and of course the <a href="https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Plushies_(Merchandise)">many freaky friends</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> - a horror series ripe for plushification. What makes me marvel at Soma's plushie is that, while these others represent something unabashedly harmful - monsters, curses, enemies out to get you - poor little Simon is a soft symbol of a <em>conceptual</em> horror. You can't defeat or outrun or even hug away the horror of Soma. It makes this little robot fleeceboi all the more unsettling. It is a toy that makes me laugh, nervously.</p>

			<p>While Microsoft has made strides with Game Pass PC and Microsoft Store versions of PC games, there's still a lot to do in this area, as testified by the recent release of Still Wakes the Deep.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's first-person survival horror adventure game is only the latest game to launch on Game Pass PC with several missing features, including NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR, both of which are available on Steam and Epic Games Store. The same happened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ascent-lacks-ray-tracing-and-nvidia-dlss-if-you-get-it-from-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neon Giant's The Ascent</a> in 2021 (that game also lacked ray tracing) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-dlss-has-been-fixed-for-pc-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gunfire's Remnant II</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Interestingly, The Chinese Room <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1622910/discussions/0/6234751708920749809/?ctp=4#c6234751708921440114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a detailed explanation on the Steam community forums.</p>
<p><em>To add more information, we have some technical limitations due to the difference between how the Game Pass and Steam / Epic Store versions are built. Unfortunately, this means that other upscaling options aren't available in the Game Pass version.</em></p>
<p><em>The PS5, Xbox X|S, and WinGDK (Game Pass PC) versions all have the same options. While we added extra upscaling options to the Steam and Epic Store versions. Adding them to WinGDK would require a custom coded solution.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your feedback. We are a small team and we want to help as many people play on a wide range of hardware so we will let everyone know if it's possible for us to create an update to add this feature in the future.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, the studio has now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1622910/discussions/0/4345491756988100844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new update, revealing that NVIDIA DLSS will be added to the Game Pass PC version of Still Wakes the Deep in an update scheduled to launch in July alongside other fixes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>crash/performance bugs</li>
<li>settings reverting to default status</li>
<li>deactivated subtitles reappearing</li>
<li>on-screen button prompt visibility</li>
<li>the Mud Handling progression bug</li>
<li>Yellow Marker toggle, which enables players to deactivate navigation aids in the form of yellow paint spills</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chinese Room is also investigating the possibility of adding AMD FSR. The developers promised to get back to the community once a decision has been reached.</p>

In <a href="https://wonderpla.net/news/20240619/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> shared earlier today (translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/game-freak-and-wonderplanet-announce-free-to-play-sailing-adventure-rpg-pand-land-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), the two studios describe <em>Pand Land</em> as a “casual sailing adventure RPG… where you become the captain of an expedition team and set out on a journey in search of legendary treasure.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="『パンドランド』公式PV | カジュアル海洋冒険譚RPG" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/poCTNS-bB5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">At first, it sounded to me like an attempt at aping Rare’s hit live-service <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, albeit with a blocky art style reminiscent of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-quest-is-adorable-but-ultimately-just-another-tapper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Quest</a></em> (how many of you even remember <em>Pokémon Quest</em>?). Upon watching the trailer, though, it’s more of a dungeon crawler, with you sailing to and exploring various islands with a top-down perspective. That said, there is a multiplayer component like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, where you can team up with other players and adventure together.</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">The game promises over 400 party members you can recruit, some of which appear to be blocky, colourful animals, while others are human crew members. The trailer also boasts some nice character art you could easily mistake for being from a <em>Pokémon</em> game since they’re clearly done by the same artists for that series.</p> <p data-characters="603" data-current-count="925" data-injectable="true"><em>Pand Land</em> seems like a cute and harmless enough time, though it’s unclear how its monetisation will work, and how much of a grind it can be if you don’t want to fork over real money for its microtransactions. I would say you don’t have long to wait to try it out, since it’s launching on the App Store and the Google Play store on Monday, June 24, but <em>Pand Land</em> is so far only scheduled for a Japanese release. There’s no mention of it coming to the West, but WonderPlanet has made a couple of its previous mobile games available worldwide so there’s always a chance.</p>
 <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="false">This is hardly the first Game Freak title to not be related to <em>Pokémon</em>. In the past, the studio’s put out games like RPG <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-little-town-hero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Town Hero</a></em> and the free-to-play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-pocket-card-jockey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket Card Jockey</a></em>. It’s also meant to be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/game-freak-partners-with-private-division-new-game-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaming up with Private Division on a new action-adventure game</a>, but considering Take-Two is reportedly shutting down Private Division in its entirety (according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), who knows what’s happening with that project.</p>

<p data-characters="253" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">UEFA’s Euro 2024 football tournament is in full swing, and while the players are all wearing the latest and greatest cleats during matches, Albania’s Jasir Asani caught the eye of gamers everywhere with his special <em>Super Mario</em>-themed boots. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Asani, who players his club football in South Korea with Gwangju FC, sported a pair of teal Puma boots, with Mario himself featured on his left foot, his red hat and mustache instantly recognizable. On it, he’s jumping into the air with his fist up, with coins flying around him. </p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">It should come as no surprise that his right foot showcased Luigi, also jumping for joy, while the inside of both boots featured more gold coins to show how successful the brothers have been. </p>

Clearly, Asani is a big fan of the franchise and showed off his love on one of football’s biggest stages. </p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">And what better time to do it too, with a brand-new game in the franchise announced during June 18’s Nintendo Direct. Mario and Luigi reunite for the first time in nine years in <em>Brothership</em>, with the trailer showing off the new world, mini-games in battles, and the classic platforming experience that we expect from Nintendo’s flagship. </p> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>releases worldwide on Nintendo Switch on November 7. Let’s hope that Asani finds time to play it as the K League 1 reaches its conclusion. </p>

            <p>Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBOEkEsOnG4">Early footage</a> painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.</p>
<p>Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hack-therefore-slash-captain-blood">cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008</a>. "It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece," he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.</p><!--more-->

<p>"The game underwent several iterations throughout the 2000s and was last showcased in 2010 before vanishing for years," reads a note on Captain Blood's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040220/Captain_Blood/">Steam page</a>. "Now, we are excited to bring it back, combining its original glory with a series of modern improvements for today's gamers." The re-reveal trailer above strongly resembles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhleo2vCscQ">this one from 2010</a>.</p>
<p>Captain Blood - which, yes, the blundering bosuns of RPS past are guilty of confusing with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-captain-blood">the Atari ST adventure game of the same name</a>, sorry about that - still doesn't have a final release date, but they're aiming for "fall 2024". There's definitely a longer story to write about why, exactly, the game has been in Davey Jones's locker all these years, but for the moment, all I can tell you is that Seawolf Studio are a new outfit, based in Newcastle, UK, while General Arcade are a porting studio who operate out of Singapore and Malaysia. Publishers SNEG were founded in 2020 by former GOG staffers Oleg Klapovskiy and Elena Roor, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sneg-games/about/">describe themselves</a> as "focused on reviving classic games from the digital abyss and legal hell". Their previous Steam releases include Blade Of Darkness, originally released in 2001, and Star General, originally released in 1996.</p>

			<p>Microsoft is now seemingly offering Redfall refunds for the Xbox and Steam version of the game's 'Bite Back' edition.</p>
<p>Last month, to the surprise (and anger) of many, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft announced the closure</a> of various first-party studios, including Tango Gameworks, several Bethesda Softworks studios, and Arkane Austin - the developer behind last year's Redfall.</p>
<p>Redfall launched with various editions, including the 'Bite Back' edition (both digital and physical), which included access to two upcoming heroes. As most of you will know, Redfall didn't have the best launch, and following the recent closure of Arkane Austin, the promised new heroes never saw the light. Microsoft has since promised that 'make-good offers' for those who bought the 'Bite Back' edition, but we didn't know what this offer would include - until now. At least, WindowsCentral now reports that Microsoft is seemingly offering refunds to digital owners. Not only that, but some players are claiming that Bethesda has been offering refunds for the physical version as well (through a ticket). "Refunds seem to be rolling out in waves, with some having received one already, while others are currently in waiting", the article from WindowsCentral <a href="http://Refunds%20seem%20to%20be%20rolling%20out%20in%20waves,%20with%20some%20having%20received%20one%20already,%20while%20others%20are%20currently%20in%20waiting.%20You%20should%20check%20your%20Junk%20Mail%20attached%20to%20your%20Steam%20or%20Xbox%20account%20in%20case%20it%20has%20fallen%20in%20there" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reads</a>. "You should check your Junk Mail attached to your Steam or Xbox account in case it has fallen in there."</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Arkane Austin's closure, Arkane Austin's Studio Director, Harvey Smith, took to X with an emotional goodbye, in <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-austin-studio-director-gives-emotional-goodbye-to-colleagues-wonders-about-the-sweet-spot-team-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which he also questioned what would be the ideal team size when it comes to making the games he likes</a>.</p>
<p>Redfall is avaialble now across Xbox Series X|S and PC. Here's what we wrote about the vampire shooter in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/redfall-dishonored-meets-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our launch review</a> last year:</p>
<p><em>"With Redfall, Arkane strayed a bit too far from its roots and couldn't nail the landing. While the core gameplay is fun, and there are moments of brilliance that harken back to Arkane's glorious portfolio, most of the studio's strengths clearly do not mesh well with the open world genre, as exemplified by the disappointing safe house missions. Additionally, the writing is very uneven, never succeeding in making the player care about any of the characters, and the co-op mode adds little substance."</em></p>

            <p>Bluepoint Games is still "working on an original title" for its parent company Sony.</p>
<p>The Demon's Souls remake developer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">acquired by Sony back in 2021</a>. At this time, it said it was "working on original content right now", and while the studio could not share any further specifics, it called this "the next step in the evolution for us".</p>
<p>In the years since, the developer has remained quiet on its plans. However, when asked if the studio was still working on original content during an exchange on social media platform X, Bluepoint's head of technology Peter Dalton replied: "Nothing has changed since our statement that we are working on an original title."</p>

<p>"Everything takes time," Dalton continued, adding the Bluepoint team is "committed to sharpening our skills!"</p>
<p>Bluepoint Games is known for its remakes and remasters. Along with Demon's Souls - which released back in 2020 as a PlayStation 5 launch title - the studio was also behind titles such as Uncharted's Nathan Drake Collection, Gravity Rush Remastered, and a Shadow of the Colossus remake.</p> <div>

<p>Confirmation from Dalton that Bluepoint is still working on its original title stemmed from an earlier post on the developer's feed. Here, Dalton shared his thoughts about FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki's comments regarding layoffs.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Miyazaki, who is currently preparing for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-layoffs-at-fromsoftware-wont-happen-as-long-as-this-company-is-my-responsibility-says-miyazaki">mass layoffs won't happen at his studio "as long as this company is my responsibility"</a>. Dalton called this stance "very respectable".</p>

This acts as an update to the Elden Ring base game and a day one patch for the hotly anticipated expansion.</p><p>Patch 1.12 adds new inventory features, including marking newly obtained items with a "!“, and a new tab called Recent Items so players can quickly review recently obtained items.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/er1-1718871509420.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Elsewhere, there are new Summoning Pool features, such as active Summoning Pools now carrying over to NG+, and individual Summoning Pools enabled / disabled in the newly added Map Functions Menu.

Just like previous FromSoftware games Dark Souls and Bloodborne, however, accessing the DLC isn't as simple as selecting it on a menu, as players must tick off a handful of obscure feats beforehand, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc"><u>including beating an optional boss</u></a>.

We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><h2>Elden Ring update 1.12 patch notes:</h2><h2><strong>New feature</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added support for the <strong>SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE DLC</strong>.</li><li>Five new hairstyles have been added to the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-developer-alleges-things-were-going-extremely-well-before-its-cancellation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=life-by-you-developer-alleges-things-were-going-extremely-well-before-its-cancellation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="453" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It was already disappointing to hear that Sims competitor <em>Life by You</em> had been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-calls-off-its-early-access-launch-with-no-new-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indefinitely delayed</a>, but it seemed the behind-the-scenes situation was grimmer than we thought. Earlier this week, Paradox Interactive announced it had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-canceled-after-being-indefinitely-delayed-a-month-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only cancelled the game</a>, but had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/paradox-is-shutting-down-life-by-you-developer-paradox-tectonic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down developer Paradox Tectonic too</a>. In the wake of this, though, one member of the now defunct studio has claimed that progress on the game was going much better than it sounded.</p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/former-dev-from-sunken-sims-competitor-life-by-you-alleges-the-team-had-the-rug-pulled-from-under-them-despite-outperforming-the-company-s-internal-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, one Willem Delventhal took to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ifyouwillem_indierevolution-gamedev-gamedevelopment-activity-7208887303224606720-cgcV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> to say that the team at Paradox Tectonic were doing “extremely well” ahead of <em>Life by You</em>‘s planned early access launch on June 4. After having already been delayed once before, the game was suddenly put on an indefinite hiatus, followed by the aforementioned cancellation.</p> <figure data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Paradox Interactive</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">“I cannot share specific numbers, but I can say that we had an internal metric we were aiming for that had been approved, and that we exceeded that number by a significant portion,” wrote Delventhal. He added that they “got a thumbs up a few weeks before launch,” which makes it sound like the delay was as much of a surprise to the team as it was to fans waiting to play <em>Life by You</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="808" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">By comparison, Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester, when explaining the reasons for the cancellation, had said <em>Life by You</em> would not be able to meet the company’s expectations and that “a version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away.” This doesn’t match up with what Delventhal is alleging. By his account, everything was going incredibly smoothly, especially if they were exceeding internal targets, yet Paradox pulled the plug anyway. Deventhal has also claimed he and his team were never told why their studio was closing: “Instead we spent a month in purgatory, and did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching, including things like finding potential buyers or suggesting cutting ties and going indie. We heard virtually nothing back.”</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">It must be stressed that Delventhal’s comments do not represent the rest of Paradox Tectonic; he is only speaking for himself, and has refrained from sharing his own theories on why the project was ultimately canned. However, he did add, “This industry has become a place in which you can deliver more than expected, have AA money behind you, and still have the rug pulled two weeks before launch.”</p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">The games industry is most certainly in a rocky state; in fact, calling it rocky is a massive understatement. After all, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a distressing number of people have been laid off this year</a>, and that number has only increased thanks to the closure of Paradox Tectonic.</p>

		<p>Maze Theory, developers of Peaky Blinders: The Kings of Random and Doctor Who: The Edge of Time, has announced a mixed reality puzzle adventure game, Infinite Inside. The game is coming out on 12th July just in time for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> launch in Europe, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest</a> and Pico, where it will be able to feature mixed reality. A fully VR version is also releasing on the same date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> and Steam VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinite Inside | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLxaHT_1Wl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Infinite Inside will look to blend together augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) on platforms that support it, starting off in your living room (other real world play spaces are available, and VR-only platforms will have a fully virtual space) with a strange pillar sprouting out of the floor and then zipping you in and out of full VR spaces. The puzzling looks to revolve around finding complex broken up blocks and piecing them together like 3D jigsaw pieces. These then slot into that stone pillar in your room.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting concept, putting puzzling first with a light narrative wrapped around it, as you follow echoes of past explorers, and one that Maze Thoery has opened up to VR enthusiasts via ApplLab and SideQuest already, gaining community feedback to help improve the game.</p>


<p>Ian Hambleton, Maze Theory CEO, says: “With&nbsp;Infinite Inside&nbsp;we’re looking to break new ground, by interweaving MR and VR in previously unseen ways. Demo feedback shows we’ve hit the spot, as mixed reality fans and gamers love it”</p>
<p>Another key element is how it uses the MR capabilities of each specific headset, with Quest 3 users having controllers to use and support for hand tracking, while Apple’s fledgeling platform</p>
<p>He adds: “It’s the advanced, innovative new experience that early adopters of MR technology (Quest 3, Apple VisionPro) have been waiting for. The game has a broad appeal for curious creatives and problem solvers, tech enthusiasts as well as fans of adventure and puzzle gaming. It’s pure escapism and offers top quality graphic environments and intuitive authentic interaction.”</p>

        <p>Sony has yet to exhibit at world's biggest games trade show since the event returned after the lockdown years</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment will reportedly not attend this year's Gamescom in Cologne.</p>
<p>The platform holder told German trade outlet <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-2024-sony-playstation-absage/">Games Wirtschaft</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-is-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year/">VGC</a>, that it will not be exhibiting at the annual games trade show.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Sony for confirmation.</p>
<p>2024 would mark the third year running that PlayStation has skipped Gamescom, having opted not to exhibit in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-will-not-attend-gamescom-2022">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-skips-out-on-gamescom">2023</a>. The company has not appeared at the show since 2019; Gamescom was either cancelled or a digital-only affair the following two years due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The platform holder also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-will-skip-e3-2019">dropped support for E3 in 2019</a>, although that show never returned as a physical event after that year.</p>
<p>Sony has already announced its 2024 line-up via a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">digital State of Play presentation</a>, which aired at the end of May.</p>
<p>Its key releases for the second half of the year included new live service multiplayer shooter Concord, PC editions of Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok, and the first full-length Astro Bot title.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also previously stated it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-skipping-gamescom">will not be attending Gamescom 2024</a>, although it will be <a href="https://www.gamesmarkt.de/business/big-in-latam-gamescom-latam-announces-exhibitor-line-up-with-nintendo-and-more-f8c1620815443525fc1cc12e409a2862">exhibiting at the inaugural Gamescom Latam</a> in São Paulo, Brazil next week.</p>

<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Great news, <em>Helldivers 2</em> fans! The special cape designed to commemorate the review bomb controversy after Sony required players to have a PSN account is complete, according to Arrowhead CCO John Pilestedt. Bad news: It’s not being released just yet. </p> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">In response to a fan question about the cape, Pilestedt confirmed that work on the special cosmetic item had been completed, but had no timeframe for a drop date, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801636341362393548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a>: “We want to find the right time to release it.”</p> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">What that means in terms of an actual launch date is unknown, and really could mean days, weeks, or even months before we get our hands on it. </p> <figure data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em> players went to war over the PSN changes. Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-design-may-be-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cape was originally teased by Pilestedt</a> back on May 11, posting a cropped image of a cape. It is being created to commemorate one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s darkest weekends when fans revolted against <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-bringing-back-mandatory-playstation-accounts-for-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s decision to make PSN accounts mandatory for PC players.</a> The decision was so unpopular that the game’s dedicated fanbase and players who truly love the game decided to take action and post thousands of negative reviews against the game on Steam, using it to show their anger with Sony. </p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">Eventually, with the negativity being so widespread and the negative reviews tanking <em>Helldivers 2</em> overall rating to “Overwhelmingly Negative” on Steam, Sony had to backpedal and admit defeat, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-backpedals-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-plans-after-3-days-of-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scrapping the plan entirely</a>. </p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="false">While this may not be a pleasant memory for Sony or Arrowhead, it was an incredible moment for gamers, showing that if we fight hard enough for what we believe in, we can convince developers and publishers to change course. For that reason, plenty of <em>Helldivers</em> will wear this cape with pride whenever we finally get our hands on it in-game. </p>

			<p>Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor might be nearing its launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The news comes from the Brazilian rating board, <a href="https://x.com/the_marmolade/status/1802922700983148876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Twitter/X user @the_marmolade.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-is-coming-to-ps4-and-xb1-ea-teases-more-games-in-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in August 2023 that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor would be released for eighth-generation consoles after all. Originally, the action/adventure game was billed as exclusive for the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>It had been nearly a year since we got any update, though. Some fans were legitimately wondering if it would ever happen. While that's certainly good news, as more gamers will be able to play the game, there's also the performance factor to consider.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was famously problematic in this regard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-pc-players-apology-respawn-no-comprehensive-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially on PC</a>. Respawn Entertainment has released several performance updates post-launch, though some issues remain to this day.</p>
<p>That said, the game itself is pretty good. It earned 8.3 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give Jedi: Survivor full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>
<p>A third and possibly final game in the saga <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-jedi-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in the works</a>, as revealed by actor Cameron Monaghan, who voices and lends his likeness to protagonist Cal Kestis. It'll likely be at least two to three years before it can be released, though.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have released the official Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree launch trailer ahead of tomorrow's global release.</p>
<p>Elden Ring's first official expansion is out tomorrow, and to celebrate the DLC's launch, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco released a 3-minute-long trailer for it. The trailer shows the game's environments, enemies, combat, weaponry, and much more. We've included it below. Be sure to check it out to fuel the hype for the expansion.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-Xh4vbs6go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>"Witness the birth of a God. The coming of a Lord. And follies better left forgotten. In that forsaken place, blood must spill."</em></p>
<p>The Shadow of the Erdtree launches worldwide tomorrow for PC and consoles. Ahead of tomorrow's release we already published <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review</a>, which you can read in full here. Down below we've included a short part of it:</p>
<p><em>After that, it did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-team-deathmatch-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-is-getting-team-deathmatch-tomorrow.906282/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-team-deathmatch-coming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>XDefiant was released on May 21 to a relatively positive reception, but the free-to-play shooter from Ubisoft wasn’t without its teething problems. To give credit to the team at Ubisoft, updates have already been released to patch out some of the most considerable issues in the game, and recently, the first season of the title was revealed, showcasing new maps, weapons, and a new faction.</p>



<p>Now, Ubisoft has announced the impending arrival of Team Deathmatch, due to land in XDefiant tomorrow, June 21.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-slaying">Slaying</h2>



<p>XDefiant has a few modes that FPS fans are very familiar with. For instance, there’s Domination, which is a tried-and-tested trope popularised by the likes of Call of Duty. Then there’s Escort, which bears strong similarities to the game mode of the same name in Overwatch 2. There isn’t anything <strong>too </strong>tactical, though – most game modes involve rampant run-and-gun styles of play.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is set to expand on that sentiment tomorrow by introducing Team Deathmatch, a timeless mode that pits two teams against one another and challenges them to get a certain number of kills faster than their opponents.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>What has two words, no objectives, and has been a frequent community request for many moons? </p><p>Jump into Team Deathmatch this Friday, June 21st at 10AM PT. <a href="https://t.co/QV4gTeK6dy">pic.twitter.com/QV4gTeK6dy</a></p></div>— XDefiant (@PlayXDefiant) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1803118032207634816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>With a vast array of weapons at their disposal and factions bursting with abilities and special gadgets, players are sure to enjoy Team Deathmatch, which is ultimately a no-holds-barred kill-fest of a mode.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed that the development path for 2023’s vampire-slaying game, Redfall, was coming to an abrupt end as Microsoft moved to shut down Arkane Austin, amongst other studios. Redfall was released in May 2023 to a crushingly negative reception, given that the game was plagued with bugs, barren, and bursting with bizarre AI-driven enemies.</p>



<p>It was just a couple of weeks back that Redfall’s final update was released by Arkane Austin before the ultimate closure of the studio. Now, thanks to the fact that promised content can’t be delivered, Microsoft is issuing automatic refunds on Steam and Xbox to those who purchased the ‘Bite Back’ edition or upgrade of Redfall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-bark-no-bite">All Bark, No Bite</h2>



<p>Following the final major update to Redfall, it has been confirmed by several players that Microsoft is automatically refunding them to make up for the content that they’ll never get. It was confirmed by reports <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-has-begun-sending-out-refunds-for-the-xbox-and-steam-digital-versions-of-redfalls-bite-back-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handed to Windows Central</a> that Bethesda Game Studios is also issuing refunds, but the path to obtaining them is a little tougher.</p>



<p>Redfall won’t be missed by too many people, but it’s a shame that it ended how it did. I was sceptical about Redfall and abandoned it at launch because of the issues but ultimately returned to the game several months later – and I had a great time with it. It was a run-of-the-mill open-world action title with some basic RPG elements and a little co-op mixed in for good measure. It wasn’t that bad and I had a great time playing it.</p>



<p>Before shutting down, Arkane Austin introduced an offline-based single-player mode to the game, eradicating the need to always be online and allowing users to play Redfall even when the studio has been fully shut down and taken offline. </p>

The Switch version remains faithful to the all-time classic while offering quality-of-life enhancements and a bunch of new collectibles to find on Koholint Island. It's a great game to revisit for those who are nostalgic for the traditional Zelda formula. And it certainly seems like the perfect Zelda game to play ahead of Echoes of Wisdom. Plus, if you want to introduce your youngsters to Zelda ahead of Echoes of Wisdom, Link's Awakening is arguably the best introduction to the series.</p></div>                      </div><p>The Switch remake earned an 8/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-a-respe/1900-6417309/" data-ref-id="1900-6417309">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening review</a>. "Though the remake has a couple of blemishes, it's still an easy game to recommend. People speak of Link's Awakening as the secret best Zelda game," critic Peter Brown wrote. "That's a tough call to make, but it's definitely <em>one </em>of the best. If you haven't touched a classic Zelda game in a while, Link's Awakening will almost instantly transport you back to the '90s. It's simple, in many ways, but the orchestrated journey still conveys a sense of adventure, and this new version is without question the best way to experience it. And more than anything else, it will put a smile on your face. Remakes are a dime a dozen nowadays and often easy to overlook. Don't make that mistake with Link's Awakening."</p><p>Link's Awakening isn't the only Zelda game on sale right now, though. You can also save on the other three mainline Zelda games that have received physical releases on Switch:</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda game deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch%2F55432568%3Fathbdg%3DL1600%26from%3D%2Fsearch%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon%2F1100-6511630%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> -- $44 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch%2F1481578625%3Fathbdg%3DL1600%26from%3D%2Fsearch%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon%2F1100-6511630%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> -- $51 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-Skyward-Sword-HD-Nintendo-Switch-Physical-045496597559%2F530817837%3Fathbdg%3DL1103%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon%2F1100-6511630%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD</a> -- $40 ($<del>60</del>)</li></ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paradox-lays-off-entire-studio-before-its-game-was-even-released.906222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/paradox-life-by-you-tectonic-laid-off-cancelled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Life By You</em>, a formerly-upcoming <em>Sims </em>rival, was supposed to be out in Early Access on June 4. It didn't make it. Two weeks after that missed deadline it was cancelled entirely, before the public even got a chance to test it, and now a day later <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the news is out that the entire studio behind it has been shut down</a>.</p><p>I know I mentioned some of this briefly in an update to my original "<a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-publishing-interactive-pc-steam-cities-skylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradox, What Are You Doing?</a>" post, but that was a story mostly about the company's doomed attempts at publishing external games. Given this is a result of Paradox's <em>internal </em>struggles I wanted to break this news out into its own blog.</p><p>Paradox Tectonic was opened by its Swedish parent company back in March 2019, expressly to develop this game. This is the part of the article where I stress that the broader outcomes here are nothing new, that studio closures linked to game cancellations have long been part of this industry, as has been laying off workers when their work on a game is finished. I'm not saying that's <em>right</em>, just that there's precedent for it.</p><p>But those moves have traditionally come when a game is out and has, by whatever metric, failed. Or, at the other end of the scale, when a game fails to get off the ground earlier in development, and a publisher decides to cut its losses, or as it would probably say, "reallocate resources". To commit five years of work, to build an entire company around the goal of producing a single game, and then throw it all in the bin just <em>days </em>before it was supposed to come out is a whole new level of ineptitude that's particularly cruel, even by this industry's cruel-by-default standards. </p><p>My <a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-publishing-interactive-pc-steam-cities-skylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Paradox post</a> targeted their publishing arm because, over the last couple of years, it's been the most public example of the company stepping on rake after rake after rake. But to silo those publishing woes is to excuse some of  Paradox's other internal missteps which, and stop me if you've heard this before, can mostly be traced back to their decision to go public in 2016, a move that saw the company rapidly transition from the makers of some excellent (albeit niche) strategy games into...whatever it is now. </p><p>Paradox Tectonic is the perfect case study for this. Formed in 2019, it had one job: take on <em>The Sims</em>, a game that has for decades remained largely unchallenged in the genre it created. So they hired Rod Humble--former head of The Sims at EA!--and got to work. For <em>years</em> the team chipped away at EA's colossus, through a global pandemic, then <em>after </em>a global pandemic, to the point where on June 4--that's June 4, 2024, just <em>days ago</em>--it was meant to come out in Early Access and be played by fans around the world. </p><p>The reasons given for first its delay and then its ultimate cancellation are basically that Paradox, just <em>days </em>before the game's public release, didn't just realise that the game wasn't great, but that it was so busted that it could <em>never </em>be great:</p><blockquote><p>...<strong>when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process</strong>.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That's <em>wild</em>. What the fuck was happening there? Who had been overseeing development for those five years, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180452/life-by-you-canceled-paradox-interactive#:~:text=Life%20By%20You%20was%20last,March%205%2C%20then%20June%204." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to see its Early Access delayed twice already</a>, then have it get to the point it was finally days away that release, only for someone <em>else </em>to swoop in and say it was so bad it needed to be cancelled? That's a level of ineptitude that I can't remember ever seeing at this end of the business before. Releasing a bad game then trying to fix it with updates is one thing, as is cancelling a bad game much earlier in development. But this? This speaks to something being very wrong at the highest levels of Paradox, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-by-you-team-spent-a-month-in-purgatory-before-studio-closure-laid-off-paradox-dev-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially when the affected workers reportedly only found out through a public announcement</a>.</p><p>Something the company even admitted in <em>Life By You's </em>cancellation! Saying the late decision was "a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community's expectations", deputy CEO Mattias Lilja put on record:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better</strong>.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>They absolutely do, if only so something of this magnitude never happens again. Which, of course, will come too late for the workers at Paradox Tectonic, who once again find themselves on the wrong end of a power imbalance that has hit the video game industry especially hard over the last 12 months: <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was Paradox's executives who dropped the ball here</a>, but it's the workers at Tectonic--days away from having their game released--who have paid the price. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-xbox-snub-engine-issues-not-favoritism/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> offered up plenty of exciting announcements and trailers for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-zelda-starring-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, but one of the under-the-radar exciting titles was Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. A compilation of Capcom’s various Marvel crossover fighting games and brawlers like X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and 2, and X-Men: Children of the Atom, the game is coming to PC, PS4, Switch, and… not Xbox. Unfortunately, this become the main topic of conversation surrounding the game since.</p>
<p>Many have speculated this is an intentional snub, as some past Capcom retro collections have also passed on Xbox and this jives with reports of some publishers reconsidering Xbox support <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amid “flatlining” sales of the console</a>. That said, there may be a less divisive reason for Xbox being left out in the cold.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/capcom-skips-xbox-with-another-game-as-square-enix-steps-up-with-several-new-titles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a report from Windows Central</a>, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, and most of their retro compilations, are built on Capcom’s older and increasingly-outdated MT Framework engine. Apparently, Capcom no longer has a pipeline for easily bringing MT Framework games to Xbox. This may also be the case with PS5, as there’s no native current-gen version of Marvel vs. Capcom, just a PS4 version.</p>
<p>Somewhat complicating this explanation is that Capcom also announced an Ace Attorney Investigations Collection during the Nintendo Direct, which is presumably running on MT Framework and <em>is</em> coming to Xbox. It may be the case that getting MT Framework games on Xbox is <em>just</em> difficult enough that Capcom doesn’t bother with lower-profile, lower-effort releases. Capcom’s Ace Attorney collections are, in fact, full console remakes of former handheld-only titles, while Marvel vs. Capcom is just a classics compilation.</p>
<p>For those who didn’t catch the original announcement, here are the games included in the Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection…</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Punisher (1993)</em></li>
<li><em>X-Men: Children of the Atom (1995)</em></li>
<li><em>Marvel Super Heroes (1995)</em></li>
<li><em>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter (1996)</em></li>
<li><em>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter (1997)</em></li>
<li><em>Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes (1998)</em></li>
<li><em>Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes (2000)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be playable on PC, Switch, PS4, and PS5 via backward compatibility, sometime in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-warhammer-40k-armies-to-play/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-warhammer-40k-armies-to-play<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="240" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">People enjoy Warhammer 40K for a number of reasons. The stories and lore, the aesthetics of the models, or even just for the video games. Many players, however, are out to win tabletop battles. And for that, you’ll need a strong army.</p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Below is a list of 10 <em>Warhammer 40K</em> armies that have over a 50% win rate according to official statistics. So for one reason or another, they’re pretty good. It is thanks to <a href="https://www.stat-check.com/the-meta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stat Check</a> that we know these statistics, although the reasons behind each army’s success has been gathered from public opinion and my own knowledge.</p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true">Also remember that nothing good ever lasts in the grimdark future, so expect some nerfs to the top performers as time goes on. Additionally,<em> </em>I have not ranked these entries as the data will shift around, and subtle overtakes could occur at any time. Regardless, these ten are some of the strongest picks in the current meta.</p>
 <h2 id="h-space-wolves" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/wPYDqa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Space Wolves</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://geni.us/wPYDqa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Space Wolves</a> are a formidable Adeptus Astartes chapter, likely thanks to their space marine hunting past. If you have what it takes, you could find yourself winning in any combat situation thanks to their versatility and core strengths.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">The Space Wolves excel in close-quarters combat, although they are also skilled in the others ways of Adeptus Astartes warfare. With access to dreadnaughts, vehicles, and a wide variety of characters and champions, you can’t really go wrong with the Space Wolves.</p> <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Despite having a shaky start to 10th Edition, they have since proved their worth with big tournament wins and a good win rate, despite being largely under-utilized. </p>
 <h2 id="h-orks" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Buw853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Orks</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">You know ’em, you love ’em. It’s easy to see why the <a href="https://geni.us/Buw853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Orks</a> are on this list if you’ve ever been up against them. They’re loud, proud, and have an insurmountable amount of dakka to throw at anything standing in their way.</p>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Despite being a horde army, the Orks are incredibly capable and have a wide variety of vehicles, meks, and characters to bolster their swathes of already lethal boyz. Also with a large array of tribes to become, you can mold your Ork army to your liking – and still be good at killing things.</p> <p data-characters="86" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">The Orks are a fan-favorite, and they’re also a great pick for winning battles. </p> <h2 id="h-grey-knights" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/YZs7jNj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Grey Knights</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://geni.us/YZs7jNj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Grey Knights</a> are a mysterious and enigmatic chapter of the space marines, and you can see this come to fruition in their matches. Relying more on trickery and a high skill level, the Grey Knights aren’t beginner-friendly. Although they are very strong if you have what it takes to figure them out.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Utilizing their teleportation abilities will be key to unleashing the full effectiveness of the Grey Knights, which takes attention away from the vehicles and more costly units in the faction. Although using dearer units isn’t unadvised, you’ll typically see the strongest armies using them lightly, or not at all.</p>
 <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="96" data-injectable="false">They may be tricky to get the hang of, but they can face any other army with the right strategy.</p> <h2 id="h-thousand-sons" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Bkpqwua" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Thousand Sons</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://geni.us/Bkpqwua" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Thousand Sons</a> are only one of the two Chaos factions on this list, and for very good reason. Consistently, the Thousand Sons are able to wreak havoc using their magical abilities and monstrous daemons.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has pulled its beloved action-adventure Beyond Good and Evil from a number of digital stores, prompting speculation that its previously announced remaster is set to launch very soon.
</p>
<p>
Beyond Good and Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition - a remaster of the original 2003 game - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">confirmed to be in development</a> last November, after a "technical error" (as Ubisoft termed it) inadvertently granted some Ubisoft+ subscribers access to an early development build.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Ubisoft gave its Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition an "early 2024" release window - and the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-news-teased-for-showcase-tomorrow">recently confirmed</a> it would be sharing more news on the remaster during this week's Limited Run Games Showcase.

<p>
But now, keen-eyed internet watchers (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/beyond-good-evil-delisted-ahead-of-20th-anniversary-editions-reveal-this-week/">VGC</a>) have spotted Ubisoft is starting to delist the current version of Beyond Good and Evil from digital stores, suggesting the remaster isn't just poised to receive a release date; it could be launching very soon.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, Beyond Good and Evil's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/15130/Beyond_Good_and_Evil/">store page</a> now reads, "At the request of the publisher, Beyond Good and Evil is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search." And while it remains available for PC via GOG (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/beyond_good_and_evil">with a 70 percent discount</a> if you're looking to snap it before it vanishes forever), the 2011 console remaster Beyond Good and Evil HD has also been <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/beyond-good-evil-hd/C28HP82H7MN8/0001">removed from sale</a> on Xbox.
</p>
<p>
If this <em>is</em> all preparation for an imminent Beyond Good and Evil remaster release, we'll likely have confirmation in less than 24 hours. Ubisoft has promised to share more details of its Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition tomorrow, 20th June, during the <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1803143881367617875">Limited Run Games Showcase</a> - which airs on YouTube and Twitch from 7pm.
</p>
<p>
As for Beyond Good and Evil 2, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-vapourware-it-seems">remains vapourware</a> some 16 years after its announcement, so it's probably wise not to get your hopes up for that one anytime soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
You might have noticed that the second <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most played game</a> on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It's a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There are a variety of banana pictures, some animated, from crystalline bananas through uwu bananas to banana black holes, all of them "made by the community in Discord" according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/">the Steam page</a>. The banana pictures can be sold on the Steam Marketplace, with the developers (and Valve) taking a cut from every sale. Most of them are sold for pennies, but there are a rare few that are traded for considerable sums. At the time of writing, there are four "Crypticnanas" on the Marketplace that supposedly go for £1335.09 a peel. The homely  "Thickglassnana", meanwhile, can be yours for a mere 71p, which is around the price of a bunch of tasty, potassium-rich real-life bananas from Sainsburys.
</p>
<p>
It's the trading element, of course, that underpins the Banana game's popularity - this and a dollop of FOMO, a love of shiny objects, and a faint hope, especially among despairing video games journalists, that Banana might turn out to be something more than it is. To their credit, the game's creators aren't making any grandiose Curiosity-Cube-esque promises. One of the devs, Hery, has openly described Banana as "a legal 'Infinite money glitch'" in conversation with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg">Polygon</a>.
</p>
<p>
As you might expect of a legal infinite money glitch, Banana has a massive botting problem, and Hery is bracingly upfront about this too. "Since the game takes basically one percent to no resources of your PC, people are abusing up to 1000 alternative accounts in order to get Rarer drops or at least drops in bulk," they told Polygon. At one point last week, around 94,000 of the game's approximately 141,000 players were bots. Today, the game peaked at 875,542 users.</p>
<p>The developers say they're trying to get Valve to clamp down on the bots, but it seems obvious to me that Banana was designed with this outcome in mind. There have been arguments that Banana is an outright scam of some kind - I'm not sure it fits any particular legal definition, but with its appetisingly naff fruit designs and promise of instant wealth, it's certainly geared to reel in the kind of player who falls victim to scams. It's no huge surprise that one of its creators, Theselions, has been involved in dodgy cryptocurrency shenanigans, though Banana itself doesn't appear to run off the blockchain. 
</p>
<p>
"As you all have heard by now Theselions used to be involved in a steam market 'bitcoin' scam/bug," the team's co-owner aestheticspartan revealed on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1225691328998936576/1236959941097558056">Discord</a> yesterday, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banana-game-not-a-scam-says-developer">Eurogamer</a>. "We did not know about this until recent videos started to point this out and we had a talk almost immediately with the whole team about the situation. We gave him the chance to explain the situation to us and we know he is showing remorse and is sorry about what happened in the past." Theselions and the Banana team have now parted ways.
</p>
<p>
That's pretty much all there is to know about Banana at the time of publication. I honestly hope this is the only piece I write about the thing, but I'm sure I've just jinxed myself by penning those words. The ray of hope is that Steam players seem very alive to Banana's essential banality and vapidity, to the point that some are playing it for the thrill of being the butt of the joke: one of the most popular user tags for the game is "psychological horror".
</p>
<p><strong>Update 20th June 2024</strong>: Did I write "that's pretty much all there is to know about Banana"? That was before I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aitVHsg0rWA">Jauwn's deep dive into its workings and origins</a>, which makes clear that the whole thing is shady as hell. Stay away. Thanks KDR_11k for passing it on.</p>

All of that hasn’t been enough to satiate my desire for more of <em>The Expanse</em>, and I know I can’t be alone.

As an RPG it also lets you organically grow and connect with your own space crew in a way that no other game has quite managed. <em>Expanse </em>fans turning to <em>Mass Effect</em> will probably end up finding their second-favorite sci-fi series in the games.&nbsp;</p>

Humanity has spread throughout the stars, and the game is essentially a flight simulator that gives you various jobs like mining, interstellar delivery, and pirate hunting to complete. The galaxy in <em>Elite </em>is actually the Milky Way, and all the small touches that make <em>Elite</em>’s simulation feel so real help make this otherwise simple game incredibly engaging – particularly in VR.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2%E2%80%99s-old-dungeon-keys-are-not-included-in-the-legacy-collection-bundle.906099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-old-dungeon-keys-are-not-included-in-the-legacy-collection-bundle/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2s-old-dungeon-keys-are-not-included-in-the-legacy-collection-bundle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The consensus on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s latest expansion pack is quite clear: <em>The Final Shape</em> is a delight in most ways that matter, and it delivers <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a superb finale to the Light and Dark saga</a>. For those eager to grab all the available content through the Legacy Collection, though, there is bad news.</p> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">Specifically, even though it’s a good thing that Bungie has bundled all of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s previous expansion packs into a single Legacy Collection bundle (which makes the deal particularly enticing for newcomers), you don’t <em>actually</em> get all of the older legacy content at once. Instead, you’ll still be missing out on Dungeon Keys for the <em>Lightfall</em> and <em>Witch Queen</em> expansion packs. In effect, this means you only get access to the three classic dungeons (Pit of Heresy, Shattered Throne, and Grasp of Avarice) and the free Prophecy dungeon, while the remainder you’ll need to spend even more money on.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-you-re-not-getting-dungeon-keys-in-the-destiny-2-legacy-collection-bundle" data-injectable="false">You’re not getting Dungeon Keys in the Destiny 2: Legacy Collection bundle</h2> <p data-characters="593" data-current-count="893" data-injectable="true">Dungeons are, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-dungeons-in-release-order-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I myself have previously established</a>, a crucial aspect of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s endgame content. Not having access to them is something you’re bound to feel as you progress from the early stages of your progression over to advanced tiers and begin seeking out top-tier equipment and Exotics. The fact that purchasing the $69,99 Legacy Collection bundle only nets you one <em>half</em> of the grand total of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s dungeon roster is disappointing, to say the least. As the Reddit thread embedded above shows, the players aren’t thrilled with this development, either.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Each Dungeon Key (i.e. two dungeons) sets you back a whopping 2,000 Silver, too. This means that after you’ve already spent about $70 USD on the base gameplay experience, you’ll also need to spend an additional $40 USD to fill out your collection. Further, more dungeons <em>are</em> on the way, so if you get really hooked on the admittedly tense and rewarding gameplay loop of your average dungeon, you should be prepared to splurge even more money in the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">It’s not a phenomenal look, no matter how you flip it. And, while the Legacy Collection itself is bound to go on sale sooner or later, Bungie isn’t particularly keen on discounting Silver in the Eververse store, so the odds are solid that those Dungeon Keys will only be available at full price for the foreseeable future.</p> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="false">Certainly, you <em>could </em>argue that none of this diminishes the huge win that is <em>The Final Shape</em> DLC. You could technically enjoy it as a standalone experience, for sure, but much of it hinges heavily on you having experienced the prior <em>Destiny</em> content to some extent, and while dungeons themselves aren’t entirely crucial, it still feels kind of strange to see them carved out of the equation in such a manner. So, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-franchise-renaissance-weve-been-waiting-for-or-just-another-outlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per usual, it’s a give and a take with <em>Destiny</em></a>.</p>

<p data-characters="343" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warframe’s</em> Jade Shadows update comes with a lot of new content that’s immediately interesting. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-jade-shadows-quest-in-warframe/">new cinematic quest</a> is great for those who’ve caught up with the story so far, the newest frame Jade makes for a great support frame, and all the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-evensong-in-warframe/">new weapons make for easy Mastery</a>, or possibly some new tools for your arsenal. </p> <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">One aspect that’s not talked about much however can be massive for your builds. Here are all the new mods introduced with <em>Warframe’s</em> Jade Shadows update.</p> <h2 id="h-every-new-mod-with-the-jade-shadows-update-for-warframe" data-injectable="false">Every new mod with the Jade Shadows update for Warframe</h2> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">While not many mods were introduced with this update, four new augment mods are available for <strong>Protea, Sevagoth, Dagath, and Qorvex</strong>. Each of these can be slotted into that frame to change up one of that frame’s abilities, giving it more functionality or completing transforming it. Here is each mod, along with what it does:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Temporal Artillery </strong>(Protea) <ul> <li><strong>Blaze Artillery Augment: </strong>When Temporal Anchor is activated, one existing Artillery unit will attach to Protea, halting its duration countdown. Max combo count is 20x.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Dark Propagation</strong> (Sevagoth) <ul> <li><strong>Sow Augment:</strong> Enemies killed while inflicted with Sow spread its effect in a 15m radius. Shadow’s Death Harvest also inflicts Sow.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Spectral Spirit</strong> (Dagath) <ul> <li><strong>Grave Spirit Augment:</strong> Immediately assume Grave Spirit’s Spectral Form. 100% chance for weapons and abilities to apply Doom. Kills outside of Spectral Form decrease its cooldown by 1s.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Wrecking Wall</strong> (Qorvex) <ul> <li><strong>Containment Wall Augment: </strong>Strip 50% of armor and shields from struck enemies. Hitting five or more enemies will restart the duration of any Chyrinka Pillars and empower them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="false">While most of these augment mods will likely have niche uses if not being completely outclassed, the augment mod for Qorvex is particularly interesting. <strong>Armor strip builds</strong> are a major thing for late-game content in <em>Warframe</em>, so having one ability provide 50% armor strip is massive and helps reduce the amount of other armor stripping you might need.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-super-sized-fallout-mod-is-in-trouble.906087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-on-hold/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last year, I covered the release of a trailer designed to showcase Fallout: Nuevo México, an ambitious game-sized Fallout 4 mod that planned to introduce a whole new world. With the publication of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-trailer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">18-minute gameplay walkthrough</a>, Fallout: Nuevo México was revealed as an open-ended and inviting project, but things went a little quiet after that.</p>



<p>It has now been announced that Fallout: Nuevo México is on hold indefinitely and the project lead has departed the development team. Months ago, the trailers related to Nuevo México were deleted, which was bad enough by itself, but now that the lead developer, ‘Zapshock’, has stepped back from the squad, there are serious doubts that it’ll ever surface.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unexpected-stop">Unexpected Stop</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, Fallout: London was delayed indefinitely following the news that the Fallout 4 next-gen update was on the horizon. When it was released, the team working on Fallout: London for the last few years were forced to come to terms with the fact that work they’d completed up until that point would have, in the worst case, been rendered DOA based on the sizeable update pushed out by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>Fallout: London was ‘supposed’ to have been released in April, but now there are no indications of when it’ll see the light of day – if it does at all.</p>



<p>Nuevo México was shaping up to be something more tied to the roots of the Fallout series. It was set five years after the first game in a region familiar to the series, whereas Fallout: London toyed immensely with the lore of the universe, placing players in the United Kingdom and creating an entirely original experience. </p>



<p>Nuevo México looks ready to be scrapped entirely and Fallout: London is on the ropes. It’s a sad time to be a Fallout mods fan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/evil-genius-games-owner-promotes-nft-tech-despite-company-policy-being-against-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new tabletop company is mired in an NFT controversy. Some are marketing stunts like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-to-produce-limited-run-printable-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Exploding Kittens'</em> physical NFTs</a>. Others are dubious grifts like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wonders-of-first-ccg-to-be-removed-from-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wonders of the First</a></em>. Then there are conflicts of policy and stance like Evil Genius Games owner Dave Scott promoting NFTs and Web3 technology despite the company's code of ethics being against their use.</p>
<h2>Evil Genius Games owner and NFTs</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/is-evil-genius-games-doubling-down-on-nfts-blockchain.704819/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report by ENworld</a>, Scott had participated in a pitch competition at Consensus 2024. Consensus 2024 is held in Texas and is run by Coindesk, one of the largest media and data companies dedicated to global crypto markets, blockchain and Web3 technology.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-genius-games-scott-nft-slideshow-screenshot.jpg?itok=WK68Uz3J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-genius-games-scott-nft-slideshow-screenshot.jpg?itok=JM-EZdt4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You want your Pacific Rim character turned into a token? Me neither.</figcaption></figure><p>In his pitch, Scott pitched a future of TTRPG offerings that would use the blockchain and NFTs. This pitch involved making turn-based RPGs on chain, minting items, character sheets, adventures, and NPCs as tokens that could be, bought, sold, and traded on chain.</p>
<p>Scott's pitch included a video presentation and an extended Q&amp;A. The video contained illustrations of a possible NFT future for Evil Genius Games' tabletop offerings, showing characters and ideas from their <em>D20 Modern</em>-inspired project <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everyday-heroes-rpg-book-rambo-total-recall" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Everyday Heroes</em></a>. In the Q&amp;A Scott stated the technology wasn't in place but they were starting to set up the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Scott's pitch for an NFT-based TTRPG future won the pitch competition.</p>
<p>Scott's advocacy and promotion of NFTs and Web3 technology opposes Evil Genius Games' code of ethics. On their official website, item number 2 of their <a href="https://evilgeniusgames.com/blog/our-technology-code-of-ethics/">code of ethics</a> states the company will not use blockchain or Web3 tech as part of their technology platform.</p>
<p>Notably, Evil Genius Games' code of ethics on NFTs and Web3 does come with a disclosure note. It states that one of the company's investors is the Blockchain Founders Fund, which heavily invests in Web3 startups. The note explains that an understanding is in place and that Evil Genius Games will not use blockchain technology.</p>
<p>It is a stance that becomes increasingly dubious in light of recent events. After the lawsuit regarding their cancelled <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/evil-genius-games-and-netflix-settle-rebel-moon-ttrpg-lawsuit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Rebel Moon TTRPG</em></a>, employees had begun resigning from the company citing <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/the-rise-and-fall-of-evil-genius-games.702617/">ethical concerns</a>. Those concerns included wage issues, concerns with certain technology being used, as well as interpersonal pressures.</p>
<p>Overall, Scott's presence at Consensus 2024 and the work environment of Evil Genius Games bring many things into question. The policy says one thing while the owner does the opposite. Employees leaving over ethical conflicts exacerbated by the involvement of certain investors.</p>
<p>All around a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/granteasterbrook/2023/03/01/a-beginners-guide-to-the-controversy-over-bitcoin-nfts/">highly controversial</a> technology being potentially incorporated into the distinctly analog hobby of TTRPGs.</p>
