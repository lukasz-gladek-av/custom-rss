            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will <em>Cyberpunk 2</em> be a PlayStation 7 game? Is <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> really going to be playable on Switch 2 next year? And why is Logan Paul so good at making everything he talks about, including Pokémon cards, sound so sleazy? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Ex-Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Shawn Layden is apparently pitching <a href="https://gamerant.com/shawn-layden-playstation-new-project/">a <em>Mad Men-</em>style show</a> about game development. It will probably never get made but I would definitely watch the hell out of that. Bobby Kotick could play Bobby Kotick, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/h0fo5r/in_moneyball_2011_bobby_kotick_the_ceo_of/">again</a>. For now, <em>Mythic Quest</em> remains a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/105byyf/are_we_apologizing_for_the_nazis_or_on_their/">pretty great parody</a> of the video game industry.</p>

 <h2>Logan Paul sounds desperate to sell his $5.3 million Pikachu</h2>   <p>“Pokemon as an asset class has outperformed the stock market by upwards of 3,000 percent in the last 20 years.” That’s how the online content hustler recently hyped up the upcoming auction for his PSA 10 Illustrator Pikachu card, which he claims is the most valuable Pokémon card in the world, during a segment on Fox Business.</p>

 <p>Prior to promoting the upcoming auction, Paul <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">had been wearing</a> the nearly $6 million piece of paper around his neck during wrestling matches. If anyone can pop the insane bubble around Pokémon cards coming out of the covid-era lockdown, it’s the guy who, just a couple of years ago, had to <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787">refund fans</a> for his failed NFT game.</p>

 <h2>Could <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> be the next big Switch 2 port we see in 2026?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">Data mining of the recent Title 4 Update</a> hints that development might currently be underway on a Switch 2 version. Considering <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> and <em>Pragmata</em> are also coming to the new console, that’s not completely unexpected; Capcom has been supporting Switch 2 in a big way, though <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ performance struggles on PC and console don’t instill a ton of confidence about how it might fare on the weaker platform.</p>

 <p>It might not be the only big new third-party port we see next year, either. Leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://imgur.com/YnfBIbY">reports</a> that a rumored ongoing shortage around Switch 2 dev kits has “largely been resolved.”</p> <h2>When will we see <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>?</h2> <p>Polish analytics firm Noble Securitie <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">predicts</a> it could arrive as early as 2030 with a budget of roughly $420 million. That seems to wildly overestimate the speed and efficiency of modern AAA development. My own guess is we don’t see it until 2032 and it costs over half a billion before marketing.</p>

 <h2>Zack Snyder is a fan of the Kim Kardashian skin in <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Justice League</em> director recently wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS1aM6VEd1R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=fea529be-5c29-42dd-90ce-d2129577d360">Instagram</a>, “Big thanks to @kimkardashian for carrying me to all those Royales on @fortnite over Christmas break.” The Kardashian cosmetic is <a href="https://kotaku.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-skin-item-shop-most-used-2000655163">reportedly</a> the most popular skin in all of season 7.</p>

 <h2><em>Front Missions 3: Remake</em> is right around the corner and has a free demo</h2> <p>The overhaul of the tactical mech RPG classic for PS1 arrives on January 30 and recently got a free demo for fans to try. Unfortunately, the<em> Front Mission</em> series remakes have been some of the worst around, and I’m not holding my breath that <em>Front Mission 3</em> will reverse the trend. <a href="https://x.com/senhorcorvo/status/2003901159921360908">Early reports</a> from the demo are that the game still rocks but it feels like it was thrown together on a shoestring budget.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-chinese-rpg-sword-fairy-trailer-remake-2000655947">Fans debate<em> Clair Obscur</em> becoming the new “Boss Baby Vibes” meme</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-leak-video-old-build-teraleak-window-2000655988">In-development footage shows the version of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> we didn’t get</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-5-voice-actor-ned-luke-swatted-police-live-streaming-twitch-2000655992">Cops know <em>GTA 5</em> voice actor by name because he’s been swatted so many times</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>When the U.S. gambling laws <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23561576/chalk-line-how-got-legalized-sports-betting">loosened in 2018</a>, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23561576/chalk-line-how-got-legalized-sports-betting">many and various ways it would destroy people’s lives</a> were widely predicted. It wasn’t hard to guess: you just had to look at every other country where it was allowed, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mp0dp71ryo">not least the UK</a>. But perhaps few would have bet on (sorry) this resulting in a situation seven years later where bots were making small fortunes betting on online video games. One such bot, named TeemuTeemuTeemu, has made $230,000 in just five months gambling via Polymarket on games like <em>Counter-Strike</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bot made $900 -&gt; $208k in 3 months on polymarket</p> <p>one of the most talked about bots on polymarket right now<br>farmed $208,521 pure profit in a quarter</p> <p>focus exclusively on esports<br>mainly LoL and Dota 2</p> <p>bot monitors live game<br>parses stream and official data faster than market… <a href="https://t.co/YTueu8U3Dm">pic.twitter.com/YTueu8U3Dm</a></p> <p>— Archive (@ArchiveExplorer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveExplorer/status/2005688246815146183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As noticed by X user ArchiveExplorer, the bot has made the majority of this money in the last three months, making observations of live games faster than any human could, and getting its bets in before the market can react to events in games. As such, it’s able to get bets in at far lower or higher odds than humans trying to react to in-game kills or objectives, and thus to game the market for maximum profit.</p>

 <p>Scrolling through <a href="https://polymarket.com/@TeemuTeemuTeemu">the bot’s history of bets</a>, it wins far more often than it loses, putting fairly large sums (routinely between $200 and $20,000) on very marginal improvements, bringing in modest wins of a few bucks up to around $1500. But it does this a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>—1,127 times over the months—with its biggest win being $89.3k in one bet.</p>

 <h2>You’ll never guess who let this happen</h2> <p>Of course, using bots to predict markets and make <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12827752">light-speed decisions</a> isn’t anything new when it comes to gambling. That’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low_latency_direct_market_access">how the stock markets have worked</a> for years. Given the recent rise of Polymarket, a crypto-scam-based prediction market where anyone can place bets on pretty much anything, it’s inevitable that it will eventually be entirely dominated by bots and algorithms, racing to be the fastest and most precise.</p>

 <p>Polymarket’s recent success is largely down to the Trump administration’s relaxing of regulations surrounding such an enterprise, driven—you’ll be astonished to learn—by a desire to allow Trump’s farcical Truth Social platform to offer the same sort of prediction gambling. Announced a couple of months ago, Truth Predict is the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group’s attempt, in partnership with Crypto.com, to muscle in on the market. Fun fact: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485594b3-5a72-4ae1-aa93-8ee987be1569">according to the <em>Financial Times</em></a>, Crypto.com donated $11 million to “Trump causes,” shortly followed by the closing of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the company.</p>

 <p>Oh, and guess what! Donald Trump Jr. sits on the board of Polymarket! It so happens that back in July, investigations into whether Polymarket had been acting illegally were dropped by Trump’s government, after the company had previously stopped operating in the U.S. when the Biden administration suggested it might be running “an illegal exchange.”</p>

 <p>Quick aside: any small part of the above would have been enough to end a presidency at any previous point in history. Now, this is just one of many, many schemes, scams, and grifts the current president is running, out in the open, with no consequences at all.</p>

 <p>La la la, everything’s fine, do bee do bee doo, ArchiveExplorer suggests there’s now a lot of competition to build similar and faster bots than TeemuTeemuTeemu, all designed to exploit the ways in which games like&nbsp;<em>Dota</em> and&nbsp;<em>LoL</em> are competitively played. Money isn’t real, capitalism is a grift, and <a href="https://frac.org/hunger-poverty-america">47.4 million Americans live with food insecurity</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Will Hytale Be On Steam? How To Buy Hytale, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-steam-how-to-buy-hytale/</link>
            <guid>1394320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale will be one of 2026’s most in-demand early access games, and buying it will be a priority for lovers of sandbox and casual games, with the odd deadly monster here and there. You’d think Hytale being on Steam would be a guarantee, but the only guarantee in life is that there are no guarantees.</p>



<p>A new year normally gets off to a slow start. January 2026 doesn’t have a plethora of huge titles, but there’s one that catches the eye—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a>. The resurrected and rejuvenated project is back on track, and Hypixel Studios is working hard to deliver the most complete game over the next few years.</p>



<p>If you want to buy it and support it, knowing if it’s on Steam will be a huge help.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-hytale-on-steam">Can You Buy Hytale On Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Flamingo? Bingo. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale will not be available to purchase from Steam once it launches into early access in January 2026.</strong></p>



<p>‘But this would help Hytale succeed and bring more attention, surely?’ If this is your sentiment, it’s correct. But if you’re wondering why Hypixel Studios has made the call to skip Steam, there’s a very clear and respectful reason:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No, not initially. We want to spend our time in Early Access working with our existing community to improve the game, rather than chasing a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction. We don’t shy away from honest, negative criticism; we have been very critical of the state of the game ourselves on social media. We simply want the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game’s development background.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, Hytale will be on Steam at some point, but only once the developer feels comfortable that the game is in a good-enough state to be purchased and reviewed on the platform. Negative reviews or review bombing can be destructive for any game, so this move makes a lot of sense and should be respected.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-purchase-hytale">How To Purchase Hytale</h2>

<p><strong>The only way to buy Hytale right now is to make an account through the game’s website, verify your details, and complete the purchase.</strong></p>



<p>Check out these quick and handy instructions if you want to buy Hytale now:</p>



<ol>

<li>Click one of the <strong>Pre-Purchase</strong> buttons.</li>



<li>Choose the edition you want, and click <strong>Pre-Purchase</strong> underneath it.</li>



<li>Create an account and verify it.</li>



<li>Accept the <strong>I Understand</strong> prompt for the Pre-Purchase notice.</li>



<li>Complete your Hytale order.</li>



<li>Once it’s done, you can download Hytale early access close to launch and start playing once it’s live.</li>
</ol>



<p>You’ll be met with this message before you continue with the purchase, just as a warning:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This version represents the core of the game while development continues. Features will grow, evolve, and sometimes change direction based on your feedback. You may encounter bugs, unfinished content, or occasional instability, and saved games may need to be reset as we update systems. If you’re looking for the full experience, we recommend waiting for a later release; but if you’d like to help shape Hytale’s future, we’d love to have you with us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Has Hytale done enough to convince you to buy it? If you’re thinking about buying it or have already purchased it, you can say why and discuss all things Hytale through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<section><p>It exemplifies the unsexy and tedious work of building bridges and community in its quest design, upgrade systems, and writing.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Throughout the events of Promise Mascot Agency, I was Pinky's ride. Anywhere that she needed to go, I had to ferry her in my crappy little truck. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for the transport of any and every mascot that stumbled through the doors of the Promise Mascot Agency and came under my employ. When Kofun needed to go to a nearby graveyard, I was the guy for the job. When Trororo needed a lift to the local adult store, I begrudgingly told him to hop in. Be it by land, air, or sea, it became my responsibility, and mine alone, to make sure everyone got where they needed to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Promise Mascot Agency is a game filled to the brim with chores and mundane tasks like this. As I traveled across the isle of Kaso-Machi, drifting in and out of decrepit villages and farm fields, I found that Promise Mascot Agency's cast was filled with folks in need of some assistance. The English teacher who worked unpaid overtime shifts to put on a night school at her underfunded workplace. The nearby mechanic with an insatiable curiosity for the occult, and no time between his job and family. If a shrine needed to be swept, I was there with a broom in a split second. Whether it was the local barkeep in a gimp suit, the streamer-turned-farmer, or of course, the disenfranchised youth, I was there with an olive branch to extend.</p><p dir="ltr">Promise Mascot Agency probably sounds like a convoluted game. It is. In one breath, it is a title about an ex-yakuza--handsomely voiced by the same actor behind Kiryu in the Yakuza games--driving around a countryside, rounding up seemingly endless collectibles and upgrades, and sending living mascots (like a giant crying tofu block) out on jobs via a simplistic management system and card-based minigame. In the latter, you must play support cards with differing strengths and weaknesses as a mascot performs a job in order to beat a troubling interference that arises and assure the job is a success. In another breath, it is a full-throated exercise in the lengths of compassion and empathy. It is rarely sleek and sexy about it--Promise Mascot Agency doesn't feature over-the-top set pieces or hide slick new super moves to reward the player for completing its long list of chores. But real, tender empathy for your fellow man rarely does look so good, and Promise Mascot Agency's unglamorous honesty is something I've come to admire from one of 2025's best and brightest games.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first arrive in Kaso-Machi and take on stewardship of the mascot agency, your primary goal is to drive better foot traffic to the formerly popular tourist destinations around town. Due to the dwindling economic status of the island, most of the people who have survived its trials and tribulations have moved on from it. All that's left behind are pockets of increasingly poorer people who are either too proud to leave or simply stuck. The economy needs a shot in the arm, and so it falls on you as Michi--who has been cast out from the yakuza for a job gone wrong--to send in mascots to the few businesses still operating, drum up interest, and invest your earnings into other ventures and mascots around Kaso-Machi.</p><p dir="ltr">Progress is slow but steady. Before you know it, districts that once seemed destined to fade into nothingness begin displaying faint signs of life again. A long-dormant festival is resurrected and, with time, this energy ripples outward to the rest of the island. The largely abandoned train station in the heart of town, which is presided over by a charming man and his cat-with-a-hat, is brought back from the brink of redundancy. A few towns over from Kaso-Machi's central hub, you revive an arcade. As the cultural centers and infrastructure of Kaso-Machi are resurrected, life in the reportedly cursed isle begins to flourish once more, and its residents invest that good will and energy back into you, the catalyst for this change.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623273"></a><figcaption>Pinky isn't the only weirdo you help out across Kaso-Machi.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sure, what I'm describing is a fairly standard upgrade system, but something about the way Promise Mascot Agency conveys them makes it stand above its peers. The "power-ups" gifted to Michi and Pinky aren't really the kind of skills that the player can then turn around and use for their own benefit like a standard skill tree or progression system. For example, you get a turbo upgrade for your truck, but it doesn't benefit you alone to use it. There are no races in Promise Mascot Agency, though a post-launch update did add time trials. It is, however, useful in getting you, and whomever you're carrying, to your destination more quickly and continuing to help and delegate tasks around the island. The same goes for the eventual boat and flying upgrades you gain as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Promise Mascot Agency follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The cannon upgrade you receive partway through Promise Mascot Agency almost appears like the moment the game might introduce some kind of vehicular combat. Instead, you use it to launch Pinky, Promise Mascot Agency's sociopathic companion character, at piles of trash, since one of the side-activities you're invited to take part in is to clear Kaso-machi's abundance of garbage You can additionally fire her at reelection signs for the corrupt mayor, whom Pinky winds up running against in the game's final act! Otherwise, the cannon is almost comically useless: It will just launch Pinky straight up into the sky to the benefit of no one at all.</p><p dir="ltr">It is kind of funny how mundane Promise Mascot Agency turns out to be. It's a lot like the Yakuza games in that sense, which feature no shortage of oddball characters on sometimes incomprehensible journeys that often resolve themselves in deeply humane, relatable, and sometimes abjectly dull ways. It is a perspective on the human condition I resonate with on a profound level, and it is one I was so happy to find beneath the surface of Promise Mascot Agency. It's why I reveled in the simplistic motivations of its cast, and why I found myself entranced by the busywork they constantly dropped on me, as well as the mission of bettering the lives of everyone in Kaso-Machi. Of building a community that could withstand the corruption of local governance, overcome its grisly and tragic past, and forge a brighter future together.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the community-building the player spends the game toiling away at--all the garbage you clean, signs you take down, and businesses you bring back to Kaso-Machi--comes to a head in the game’s rousing finale. To make a complicated matter short, the continued existence of your agency, which has provided a home to mascots, economic stability to the island, and exposed local corruption, is being threatened. The only way to assure it continues is to win a national competition that is, as becomes obvious, rigged against you.</p><p dir="ltr">You lose, and you lose quite badly. But at Michi's lowest point, he retreats to a mind palace of sorts (Pinky dubs it a "metaphysical nightmare") and comes face to face with everyone he's helped--that you, the player, have helped. Every mascot we employed, every business owner we aided, every teenage thug we straightened out, and even members of the yakuza family that had tossed us out appeared to Michi. An island's worth of friendly faces propped us up, dusted us off, and reminded us that we weren't alone.</p><p>The end of the game plays out like a gauntlet of Promise Mascot Agency's card-based minigame. Only, by the game's end, all of your allies' support cards have been consolidated into a handful of overpowered ones that wipe out any threat with a single play. And as I cruised to Promise Mascot Agency's end on the back of the community that I'd spent 20+ hours building and fortifying, I couldn't help but think that of course the strongest power of them all was the power of friendship. Who would've thought that I'd find one of the richest examples of community in one of the most bizarre games about driving a human-sized, sentient (and not to mention, homicidal) thumb around town?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="476">If you’ve ever wanted a device that’s easier to handle than a full-sized tablet but still larger and more capable than your phone, the iPad Mini fits perfectly into that sweet spot. It’s designed for people who want portability without giving up power or versatility. Whether you’re a creative professional, a student, or someone who just enjoys relaxing on the couch while scrolling for hours on end, the iPad Mini delivers a balanced experience that works in almost any situation.</p>
<p data-start="478" data-end="806">Right now, the 2024 Apple iPad Mini is even more appealing thanks to a solid discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/">The 128GB device is currently available at 20% off, which means you save $100 off the original $499 price</a>. That brings the cost down to just $399, making it one of the best times to grab Apple’s most compact tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="808" data-end="841">Big Power in a Compact Design</h2>
<p data-start="843" data-end="1253">The iPad Mini features an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that packs all the quality you expect from an iPad into a smaller, more comfortable form factor. It’s light enough to hold with one hand, making it ideal for reading, browsing, or sketching on the go. The display itself is sharp, vibrant, and designed with ultra-low reflectivity, so it remains easy to see even in bright lighting or outdoor conditions.</p>
<p data-start="1255" data-end="1689">Under the hood, the iPad Mini is powered by Apple’s A17 Pro chip. This processor delivers solid speed and efficiency, allowing the device to handle demanding tasks without slowing down. From multitasking to creative work, everything feels smooth and responsive. Apps launch quickly, transitions are fluid, and performance stays consistent whether you’re editing photos, watching videos, or bouncing back and forth between multiple apps.</p>
<p data-start="1691" data-end="2121">On the front, you’ll find a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage. This feature is especially useful for video calls on FaceTime, Zoom, or other conferencing apps, as it automatically keeps you centered in the frame—even if you move around or someone else joins you in view. On the back, the 12MP camera supports 4K video recording and makes scanning documents quick and easy.</p>


<p data-start="2123" data-end="2436">Thanks to the A17 chip, the iPad Mini also offers fast Wi-Fi connectivity and smooth performance for everyday tasks like taking notes, marking up documents, editing photos or videos, and even gaming. With iPadOS, you can boost productivity further by running two apps side by side using split-screen multitasking. It runs a number of apps such as Microsoft 365 and Adobe Photoshop, as well as graphics-heavy games, without any issues.</p>
<p data-start="2438" data-end="2949">Optional accessories like the Apple Pencil Pro and Smart Folio (sold separately) enhance the experience even more. The Apple Pencil Pro allowing you to write, draw, or edit with precision, while the Smart Folio protects the screen and doubles as a stand for hands-free viewing.</p>
<p data-start="2951" data-end="3376" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">To top it all off, the iPad Mini is available in four stylish colors—purple, starlight, space gray, and pink. You can also choose between 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage, along with Wi-Fi-only or Wi-Fi + Cellular models. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/">With Wi-Fi-only versions discounted by $100, this sale makes it possible to pick up the latest iPad Mini for as little as $399,</a> making it an excellent value for a powerful, ultra-portable tablet.</p>

<p>Regardless, I've had quite the ride thus far with my Switch 2. We're still not that far out from launch, and I expect super-duper exciting things in 2026. Loads of 'em. I can smell it. Oh no, wait, that was just my dog.</p>
<div><p>Now, while I haven't had the opportunity to review <em>all</em> of the biggest and best games released for the console in 2025, the ones I have cast my eye over make for a super solid list - with a few absolute stinkers thrown in for good measure. There's always at least one stinker thrown in for good measure. <strong>*points at dog*</strong></p><p>

With all of this in mind — and having recently revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our cumulative NL staff picks</a> — I thought it might be useful to take a look at my top three Switch 2 games of 2025, in no particular order, selected from <em>just</em> the titles that I personally spent time reviewing. Yeah? Might as well give it a go now I've gone this far, eh. I'll even give it a jaunty title.

<h2>PJ's Top 3 Games From The 25 Switch 2 Games Wot He Reviewed On Switch 2 In 2025 (In no particular order)</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></h3>
<p>I'm not having any more of this "Musou games are braindead button-mashers" patter out of you, son. I don't care if it's Christmas; that tired old line has been wrong for a while now, and in case you weren't aware, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a> makes this very clear.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days of bland, barren maps populated by one-trick CPU enemies. No more are the tired side quests, lack of challenge, lack of variety, lack of combat strategising...and all that other guff that people <em>say</em> us Musou fans have had to endure over the years. This is a big, bold, and beautiful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> adventure that earns every bit of its "official canon" legitimising from the Big N.</p>

<p>This entry learns lessons and takes stock from what went a little wrong last time out, namely that crucial balance between story and combat. The rectifying of this one crucial aspect would have been enough for me, but with the extra grunt of the Switch 2 we also get an absolute looker that's always a pure joy to sit down and blast through. It's so slick and smooth!</p>
<p>My favourite Musou game thus far? Yep, it knocks that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem</a> effort out of pole position and everything.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867 @ 1767105441 -->
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a></h3>
<p>Boof! I knew that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Ivalice Chronicles</a> was going to be good. Very good, even. I did not, however, expect to be swept away quite as hard as I was.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, you may be surprised to learn, is actually my favourite FF of the lot. It's just exactly everything I want in terms of combat, vibes and story. The trifecta...she complete! Yes, I know some folk have issues with the reframing and reorganising of the War of the Lions content in this latest cut, but I am actually a big fan of what they've done with this new version.</p>

<p>It feels cleaner, and in all honesty, I don't really need any more combat once I'm done with the main story as it was originally. The combat in the War of the Lions, well, it was just more gravy, nothing new. This snazzy new effort also does vitally important stuff like make cameras and controls easier and better to navigate with.</p>
<p>Battlefield views, tagging enemies, smarter CPU strategising all much-improved...this is genuinely making an already fantastic game a notably better one. It knocks the experience from <strong>Very Good Game™</strong> territory into the realms of things that are actually, genuinely, very difficult to find any fault with. And all of this in the palm of your hand on Switch 2. Hold me, mammy.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a></h3>
<p>I know I said this is in no particular order. But I sort of lied. The more I consider it, the more it becomes clear that nothing grabbed me in my pure gamer heart quite as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> did this year. It feels like the purest of pure sort of Nintendo magic that we Nintendo fans are forever pining after. Gies a wee sniff, mate. Go on. I just need one hit on that magic, son. Wheeeeeeee!</p>
<p>What has got me so engrossed in and excited about a semi-automated racer? Well, first of all, it's properly hard to fully master. Kirby's latest has depth for those who like it deep (phrasing), whilst also providing for the button-mashers and the low-attention-span fans. Stick at it, get used to its chaotic way of doing things, and you'll find a finely tuned racing beast purrs beneath the horror of giant neon pick-up icons. Yes, they are very big. I love them.</p>

<p>I've had some real sweaty finales (phrasing) during online matchups in this one, and all it takes is one other pro racer (or a whole bunch of you get lucky) to really awaken the magic. Once you've tasted the sweetness of a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, a victory at what feels like 1000s of kilometres per hour through a cosmic chaos of Masahiro Sakurai's creation, it's very hard not be get fully hooked.</p>
<p>If I manage one thing this year — and really, I'm leaving it seriously late in the day but there's always hope — I'd be quite happy it be turning someone, anyone, on to the delights of Air Riders. It's a game that's easy to look at and nope out of. It's also a game that's easy to pick up, play, and walk away from as something that's just a big colourful mess for kids. But what's here beats out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for me in terms of online fun <em>and</em> competitiveness. It does <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Crossworlds</a> in as well. Kirby just has it exactly where it matters, and in exactly the right manner and style for me this year. So suck on that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched this year after an extremely long wait that left much of the industry baffled, but this wait didn't prevent the system from becoming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/"><strong>smashing success</strong>.</a></p>



<p>However, it's undeniable that the new generation console by Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/"><strong>comes with some issues</strong></a>, including a <strong>long-standing controls issue</strong> which forced legendary game creator <strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong> to go to some <strong>extreme measures</strong> to fix: the <strong>lack of D-Pad on the Joy-Con controller</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20251219044/index_3.html#clo_kam">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a></strong> as part of its now traditional end-of-year wrap up with Japanese game developers, the creator of the <strong>Devil May Cry, Okami and Bayonetta</strong> series, among others, recounted his experience with the Nintendo Switch 2, finally managing to get his hands on a system only recently after purchasing a second system for his <strong>niece</strong>, who took his launch system for herself. Spending time with the system made Kamiya-san frustrated by the <strong>lack of a proper D-pad</strong> on the Joy-Con controllers.</p>



<p><em>"Even after it finally came back to me, for some reason, <strong>in this age of diversity, the manufacturer itself has stubbornly refused to offer the option of a 'Joy-Con with a D-pad'</strong> since the Switch 1. This just didn't fit into my gaming lifestyle, where I usually <strong>play while lying down</strong>, so I have no choice but to use the Joy-Con when playing games,"</em> he said, as translated by <strong><a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/2004712820403999129">Stealth</a></strong>, touching upon an issue many <strong>old-school gamers</strong> have had with the Nintendo Switch systems.</p>



<p>After continuing to use the original Switch for his daily <strong>Tetris 99</strong> fix and taking advantage of <strong>third-party peripherals</strong> with a proper D-pad, Kamiya-san decided to take matters into his own hands to make the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 his primary hardware</strong>. </p>



<p><em>"I purchased a new <strong>Cyber ​​Gadget 'mini grip with D-pad,'</strong> which I use with the Switch 1, and after some <strong>sanding and modifying</strong> it so that it could be attached to the Switch 2, where the <strong>button layout is slightly different</strong>, I was able to make my own <strong>'D-pad Joy-Con 2,'</strong> which finally allowed me to play titles from <strong>'Arcade Archives 2.'</strong>"</em></p>



<p>As someone who frequently plays old-school 2D games, I have long felt Hideki Kamiya's pain. Hopefully, Nintendo or third-party manufacturers will eventually address the issue and provide <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more controller options</strong> for those who think a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid D-pad is an essential part</strong> of any controller. As the Japanese company itself offers access to a catalog of older games via the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch Online</strong> subscription, it would make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">considerable sense</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Biggest Disappointments]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/30/game-of-the-year-2025-biggest-disappointments/</link>
            <guid>1394263</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The yearly awards season is always a great time to look back and reflect on the highs of the video games industry of the previous twelve months, and there really have been a lot of highlights! There’s been unexpected hits in the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, there’s been long-awaited sequels like Hollow Knight: Silksong that actually manage to live up to the expectations… but to focus <em>only</em> on the highs is to overlook the troubles and major failings that continue to plague the industry through the past half decade.</p>

<p>Once again it’s studio closures and layoffs that are the biggest disappointment of our year, and while job losses were nowhere near the extent of what we saw in 2024, they were still hugely impactful.</p>
<p>One of the biggest examples of this was Warner Bros. Games Studios closing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith, Player First Games and WB Games San Diego in one fell swoop</a>, cancelling the long-in-development Wonder Woman game in the process. It was another super hero game involved when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-shuts-down-developer-cliffhanger-games/">EA cancelled their Black Panther game and closed Cliffhanger Games</a>, we also saw Ubisoft Leamington closing its doors, Avalanche’s Liverpool studio, Microsoft’s The Initiative, and job losses at King of Meat developer Glowmade, People Can Fly, Jagex, Don’t Nod, Crytek, and so many more.</p>
<p>It certainly feels more difficult than ever to manage to bring a game to release and then get it the notice and attention that it needs to survive (not least when a live service is planned around it), but there’s too many instances where very profitable companies are making cuts with some handwaving about AI to sweeten their investor, or where some degree of mismanagement has led to a game’s development drifting and sliding to the point it’s unsalvageable.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping that 2026 can see us turning a corner.</p>
<h2>EA’s Saudi-funded Buyout – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>It’s not just financial bankruptcy that we have to worry about in the games industry, but a moral bankruptcy as well. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/">Electronic Arts announcing that they had agreed to sell their company</a> entirely to private investment, with the cash coming from Silver Lake Management, which is Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, and a much smaller stake going to Affinity Partners, the company of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s… which is also backed by the PIF.</p>
<p>Saudi money has been flooding out of the oil-rich country and its fellow Gulf states for a long time, most commonly seen as various acts of “sports washing” to distract from and diminish the impact of things like the country’s stance on women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, the assassination of outspoken Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and other human rights violations. PIF money has gone towards buying up football teams, founding golf tournaments, securing motorsports races, and more. However, it’s also been a part of gaming for a long time, and the Public Investment Fund already owned 10% of Electronic Arts and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">all of Niantic</a>., It also has stakes in Riot Games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Activision Blizzard</a>, Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Take Two,</a> Capcom, Embracer, Nexon, and <span data-complete="true">Koei Tecmo. They’ve also taken ownership of SNK and the Esports World Cup.</span></p>

<p>Buying up EA is their biggest move yet for the games industry, and it’s deeply concerning on so many levels for how this is inevitably getting the green light from the US government, for what this means for EA’s workforce when there’s talk of widespread use of generative AI, and obviously on a moral and cultural level. Will this see LGBTQ+ positive campaigns be sidelined in EA’s football games, and more significantly, the impact this will have on The Sims ability to represent its community.</p>
<h2>Whatever it is that Xbox is doing… – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>Having spent so long rebuilding and expanding their gaming business through the trying times of the Xbox One generation, to see Microsoft meander and slide through the 2020s has just been a bit sad. Sad and confusing.</p>
<p>2025 was another year in which we felt the way that the Xbox business is shifting away from being a direct competitor to Sony and Nintendo and towards just being another publisher on their platforms. More Microsoft-published games were confirmed and released for PS5, and that has led to significant points in time where the majority of the best-selling games on PlayStation have been Microsoft games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5’s</a> port was a big success, for example, and there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">the Halo remake announcement too</a>.</p>
<p>And that cross-platform shift could be a solid direction for Microsoft to take, if didn’t also feel like they were sacrificing everything else they had built up. The Xbox Series consoles have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/20/xbox-series-xs-consoles-get-another-us-price-hike-in-october/">become ludicrously expensive through more price hikes</a>, almost as if they’re being priced to fail, there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-2025-price-increase-ubisoft-fortnite-crew/">massive price increases for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> thinly veiled behind added services and content that I doubt many people want.</p>

<p>Of course there were also the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">mass layoffs in the middle of the year</a> that saw The Initiative shutdown and its Perfect Dark reboot cancelled, the cancellation of Rare’s Everwild, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/turn-off-the-engine-and-retire-the-car-turn-10-signals-end-of-forza-motorsport-support/">end of support for the Forza Motorsport franchise</a> (in favour of Forza Horizon), and more.</p>
<p>Part of the undercurrent to all of this are Microsoft’s two biggest bets of the last couple years. The company is all-in on generative AI, needing to show a growing install base, and wanting its employees to be dogfooding while developing, and there’s Activision needing to keep churning out Call of Duty games every single year, which has led to Black Ops 7 fumbling the FPS crown to Battlefield for the first time.</p>

<p>Where will Xbox end up in a few years time? It’s difficult to say, but we want to see it still be relevant outside of being a third party publisher and an increasingly expensive subscription service.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>We’ll be back to the lighter and brighter side of gaming tomorrow with our overall Game of the Year winner, but in the meantime, let’s catch up on all the awards so far.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-all-in-on-airtag-clearance-no-need-for-budget-trackers-as-this-4-pack-deal-hits-all-time-low-2000656018</link>
            <guid>1394260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Find My app is an incredibly useful tool for keeping track of your belongings, and it’s something I’ve personally relied on more times than I’d like to admit. From the time I accidentally left my iPhone at a restaurant to when I forgot my MacBook under a coffee shop table, this app has been a lifesaver. Even when my Apple Watch fell into a river—I didn’t manage to find that one—but the app did confirm the watch was somewhere in that river (I should really keep better care of my stuff). It’s clear that the Find My app is an essential tool for keeping track of your Apple devices. And, if you’ve ever wondered if you could track more than just your iPhone or other Apple products, there’s good news—AirTags are here to help!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>AirTags are tiny, quarter-sized discs that can be attached to almost anything you own, making them just as easy to track as your iPhone or iPad. Whether it’s your keys, wallet, or even a gaming console like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, you can use these clever little gadgets to keep tabs on all your things. One of the most practical uses is for travel. If you’ve ever had your luggage go missing at the airport, placing an AirTag in your checked bags could save you days of stress and confusion.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about picking up some AirTags, Amazon currently has a great deal.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> Normally priced at $99 for a four-pack (which breaks down to about $25 per tag), they’re currently on sale for just $65.</a> This discount of 34% saves you $35, making each AirTag cost just about $16. It’s a pretty solid deal if you want to make sure your most important items are always within reach.</p>
<h2>Couldn’t Be Easier</h2>
<p>Setting up the AirTags is incredibly simple. All you need to do is tap one to your iPhone or iPad, and it will instantly pair with your device. Once connected, the AirTag will appear in the Find My app alongside your Apple devices. From there, you can give each AirTag a specific name to keep track of exactly what it’s attached to—like naming the one in your purse “Purse” or the one on your keys “Keys.” This way, you’ll always know what’s what.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself searching for a lost item around the house and know it’s somewhere nearby, the Find My app lets you trigger the AirTag to play a sound. The AirTag has a built-in speaker that makes it easy to find your lost items, whether they’re buried under a pile of clutter or hidden between the cushions of your couch. It’s a simple but effective way to save time and frustration when you’re on the hunt for your stuff.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Yen, Chikara and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless is a comprehensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-active-climb-and-jump-tower-codes-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> RPG where players develop their anime-inspired fighter by training five core stats, mastering special abilities, and defeating increasingly powerful enemies. The main objective revolves around continuously improving your character through the game’s “endless” progression system, unlocking powerful anime-inspired abilities, and watching your fighter evolve into a formidable combatant.</p>







<p>Advancement hinges on five core stats—Strength, Durability, Chakra, Sword, and Speed—each unlocking different combat abilities as you progress. Players earn Yen as the primary currency from defeating enemies and completing quests, which is spent on multiplier upgrades that dramatically increase training efficiency. The game features a unique Champion gacha system using Chikara currency, where rare Champions like Serious Saitama can provide massive stat multipliers to accelerate your growth. While these resources can be accumulated through regular gameplay, the fastest way to jump ahead is by redeeming promotional codes. </p>

<figure><figcaption>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like most Roblox games, it is rather simple to redeem Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless codes. That being said, for players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here is a step-by-step guide to redeeming Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless in Roblox</li>



<li>Find the arrow button in the bottom-left corner</li>



<li>Click on it to scroll through the menu</li>



<li>Find a blue icon, and click on it to open the code box</li>



<li>Type or paste a code into the text box</li>



<li>Click on enter and claim the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-anime-fighting-simulator-endless-codes">Where To Get More Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes</h2>



<p>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official AFS: Endless Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts where they announce updates and milestones for this popular anime-inspired fighting game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once I finished DOOM 2016 and DOOM: Eternal, I was excited to jump back in again. Less so Eternal, but it’s a fantastic sequel to the untouchable first reboot. DOOM: The Dark Ages is arguably the most complete and well-crafted of the trilogy, but I find it the least memorable and least replayable of the three.</p>



<p>In a bid to expand and evolve, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-2-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Ages</a> feels like an extension of its predecessors, more than a full-scale demonic overhaul. Furthermore, everything new mostly misses the mark, and can make the experience go from Imp to limp very quickly. id Software probably has an ideas board more bloated than a Mancubus after a Christmas Dinner, and there’s plenty of hope for the next trip to hell.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-won-t-spell-doom-for-the-franchise">It Won’t Spell DOOM For The Franchise</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A step back. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>I think DOOM is the quintessential first-person shooter franchise, as well as the most important one. Wolfenstein 3D helped the FPS genre crawl, but 1993’s DOOM stood on its own two feet—and throats of Baron of Hellish foes. Level design, music, the guns, the gore, and the thematic touches just exude a badass aura that few have even come close to.</p>



<p>Following DOOM 3’s survival-horror detour, there was a long wait for a new game. The infamous, canceled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concept-art-and-footage-surface-of-the-cancelled-doom-4-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM 4</a> project is better consigned to history, and thank our stars it was. We got the DOOM 2016 reboot instead—which I actually think is the best DOOM game everbut that’s for another conversation.</p>



<p>Eternal upped the speed and mobility and gave us Godmode Doomguy. I’ll never forgive the Marauders’ design, though, and I’ll die on that fiery hill! Both games are fantastic in their own unique right, and then you’ve got DOOM: The Dark Ages, which serves as a prequel. id Software decided to make its level design more open and chaotic, give us a Doomguy Dragon and Kaiju-inspired levels, and tighten up the game’s story with more cutscenes and character development.</p>



<p>In trying to do more, TDA does <em>too </em>much, and actually takes me away from the thing I enjoy most about DOOM: Killing lots of demons with fun weapons in small-to-medium-sized levels. But it’s still a good game!</p>







<h2 id="h-less-is-more-more-or-less">Less Is More, More Or Less</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good, large dragon doggie. Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Long story short…I don’t prioritise story when it comes to DOOM, and I’m sure I’m not alone in that sentiment. DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 achieve so much through visual and environmental cues and clues. How am I supposed to rip and tear when you won’t let me rip and tear? The Dark Ages’ Dragon levels are cumbersome and uninteresting, and while I can appreciate the attempt to freshen things up, the Mecha Doomguy sections are boring. </p>



<p>The shield and the slower-shield-based parry gameplay are solid, but you’re always aware that it’s a conscious effort to slow the game’s pace down (not as much as the Marauder, grr), and negatively juxtaposes the game’s identity. I’m not saying I want Doomguy to go shopping for some Sonic the Hedgehog shoes and borrow a Titanfall jetpack, but there needs to be a balance. </p>



<p>Ironically, I believe that balance is still DOOM 2016.</p>



<p>id nailed everything with the game. I’d like to see the next DOOM game be more akin to 2016, and maybe borrow the odd bit of parkour from Eternal, and even some of The Dark Ages’ incredible visual aesthetic. It also wouldn’t hurt to broker peace with Mick Gordon, I beg. In the same way that DOOM 3 was starting to steer the ship away and veer off on a completely different course, I think the same needs to happen again now.</p>



<p>The series is as popular as ever, but it felt like everyone forgot about it as 2025 went on. Let’s fuse old-school and new-school DOOM again. Finding key cards in well-designed levels that don’t just rely on being open, and adding depth with hidden platforms and switches galore. A beastly soundtrack supported by grizzly battle scenes is also a must. Let’s waste less budget on theatrics and inject that into R&amp;D on fun gameplay mechanics and ideas, and re-reboot DOOM again.</p>



<p>What do you think id and Bethesda got wrong with DOOM: The Dark Ages? What needs to happen for the next iteration?

			<p>There is little doubt that the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched with <strong>far more third-party support</strong> than the original <strong>Switch</strong> did eight years ago. </p>



<p>Back then, the shift to a hybrid console was still a gamble, and Nintendo was coming off the colossal flop of the <strong>Wii U</strong>, which made third-party developers understandably wary of spending their precious resources on ports for the Switch. That meant only three third-party games were available in March 2017: Just Dance, Bomberman, and Skylanders. Not exactly heavy hitters. </p>



<p>Compare it with the Nintendo Switch 2 third-party launch lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Street Fighter 6 (Capcom)</li>



<li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (CD Projekt Red)</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Avalanche Software / WB Games)</li>



<li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (Capcom)</li>



<li>Split Fiction (Hazelight / EA)</li>



<li>No Man's Sky – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Hello Games)</li>



<li>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster (Konami)</li>



<li>Civilization VII – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (2K / Firaxis)</li>



<li>Hitman: World of Assassination – Signature Edition (IO Interactive)</li>



<li>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Sonic Team / Sega)</li>



<li>Fortnite (Epic Games)</li>
</ul>



<p>The incredible success of the original Switch and Nintendo's smart choice to pursue what is essentially a 2.0 edition with its successor made it far easier for developers to invest in supporting Nintendo's platform. So easy, in fact, that the problem reversed itself: now, there were too many developers who wanted to get access to the Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to the big studios obtaining priority access while many others were left wanting</a>, thus inevitably delaying their ability to release games on the console.</p>



<p>The situation <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still hadn't improved by July</a>. As recently as early October, we received word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-can-technically-do-path-tracing-war-thunder-dev-didnt-get-switch-2-devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive interview</a> that War Thunder developer Gaijin Entertainment had still not received its Nintendo Switch 2 developer kits. </p>



<p>Now, though, insider Nate the Hate (who had also confirmed in late August that many developers were still waiting for their kits) wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1py9h8n/natethehate_switch_2_devkit_availability_to_third/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the situation has 'largely been resolved'</a>.</p>



<p><em>In the case of Call of Duty… it doesn't mean they got a devkit super late, either. Just late enough that they couldn't get the work done to launch the game sooner. The devkit delivery situation has largely been resolved.</em></p>



<p>In the earlier portion of the statement, Nate was referring to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jez Corden's recent rumor</a> that Activision is preparing to launch a Call of Duty game for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 soon, thus abiding by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year deal made by owner Microsoft with Nintendo</a> as part of the stipulations to get the Activision acquisition through the regulatory gates.</p>



<p>With more developers having access to Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, fans should prepare for a deluge of ports in 2026-2027, especially with the new console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outpacing its predecessor in sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of the first-person entries, it's now apparently been mentioned by Nintendo how this game fits within the <em>entire</em> history of the Metroid series. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60211">Speaking to Famitsu</a> recently, Nintendo's development team reportedly told the famous Japanese gaming outlet how the latest Switch and Switch 2 outing is set <em>after</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> on the Super Nintendo and <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> on the Game Boy Advance (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/metroid-prime-4-timeline-placement/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cevhwnkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>In saying this, it's reiterated how the new entry takes place in "another dimension", meaning there is no need to worry about the timeline or possible impacts on the 2D Metroid series. As a result, players can jump into this new adventure without any prior knowledge and enjoy the original setting. It has been an 18-year wait between this game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Corruption</a>, after all.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review of Metroid Prime 4 here on Nintendo Life</a>, we also mentioned how newcomers would be able to enjoy this new adventure without having to understand the history of the series. If Nintendo, Retro Studios or a prominent Nintendo figure says anything else about how exactly Beyond fits within the Metroid timeline, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>Arc System Works finally delivered the long-awaited Switch update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, in a new development update, it has addressed the future of this particular version of the game. It mentions how the Switch version has required "a great deal of effort and ingenuity" and as a result, the team is currently examining what exact form future updates "beyond Version 2.0" could take.</p>
<p>The feasibility of this is dependent on how far the development team can push itself, and if it's able to overcome technical challenges. Here's the message in full:</p><div><figure data-videoid="myrpG5TN7_Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytmyrpG5TN7_Q" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed53c808xkjgzp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>"Regarding the future of GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Developing and operating the game on Nintendo Switch required a great deal of effort and ingenuity to work within hardware constraints.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, we are currently examining what form future updates beyond Version 2.0 could take for the Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Please note that feasibility will depend not only on technical challenges, but also on how far we can push ourselves as a development team, as well as on feedback and support from our players. All of these factors will be taken into account as we make our decisions."</p>

If you're a recent Switch 2 owner and are looking for a new RPG to play, look no further than the fantastic game that is Bravely Default.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster for $29.99</h2><div catalogid="681de1aa-cde5-4374-8e89-64521fd58645" id="233911"><div id="233911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has discounted Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster to $29.99 with a limited-time deal, which marks the lowest we've seen this game to date. Originally released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default follows four heroes across the world of Luxendarc as they attempt to reclaim the world's four crystals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default is a fascinating game for many reasons. It initially was set to be a Final Fantasy game, but it shifted mid-development into its own game despite retaining key elements of the series. Revo, best known for his work as Linked Horizon for Attack on Titan, composed the soundtrack, which is still, to this day, an incredible RPG soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster brought new minigames, a refreshed UI, and other solid quality-of-life features like fast-forward, encounter rate adjustments, and more. While this is unfortunately a Game-Key Card, the download is only 11GB, so you will not need much space available on your Switch 2 to download this one. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">best Switch 2 games</a> you can buy right now, so don't miss out on this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

<p>Is Capcom up to something?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="6c488450c3e97"><a title="Monster Hunter Wilds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c488450c3e97/monster-hunter-wilds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom’s <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a></strong> series has sold incredibly well on Nintendo hardware over the years and while there have been no official updates about the mainline series returning to Switch hardware anytime soon, something rather interesting has apparently been discovered in a new <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> datamine.</p>
<p>In the title’s latest game update, lines of code such as “via.store.Native.ns2UpgradeEdition” have <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-monster-hunter-wilds-update-gives-hope-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-version/">reportedly been added</a>.</p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be that it’s a reference to a possible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">"Switch 2 version" of the game</a>. Capcom hasn’t said anything about bringing this new entry to Nintendo platforms, but it has already shown strong support for Nintendo’s new hybrid system with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-13CJKg9tJk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7sjtklw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The main concern among fans is tied to the game’s performance. When Wilds launched earlier this year in February, there were issues identified with this aspect of the title as well as the visuals on next-generation console hardware and PC. Capcom has rolled out multiple title updates since then, but hunters are still experiencing problems.</p>
<p>How Wilds would perform on a system such as the Switch 2 remains to be seen, but there have already been some stunning efforts on Nintendo's new device including CDPR's work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Capcom has demonstrated its abilities with Street Fighter 6. Of course, there's no guarantee this discovery in Monster Hunter's latest update will necessarily lead to an announcement.</p>
<p>If you missed the news, Capcom has locked in multiple releases for the Switch 2 in 2026 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">and beyond</a>). Some of these titles include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> in February, the spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> in March, and its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> in April.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/best-games-2025-silksong-final-fantasy-tactics-9-kings-2000655728</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The thing that surprises me most about these personal GOTY lists, which I’ve been doing most years since I started working at <em>Kotaku</em> (including in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2023-zelda-cyberpunk-baldur-s-gate-3-a-1851130971">delivery room for my third child</a>), is just how little I remember them after they go up. I could guess what was on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gach-s-top-10-games-of-2020-1845962135">2020 list</a>, or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gachs-top-10-games-of-2018-1831323132">2018 one</a>, or my very first one from 2016, but I would probably get half of them wrong.</p> <p>The dirty little secret about these lists, at least for me, is how fluid and ephemeral they are. What was in my top 10 shifted throughout the year and that variance didn’t stop once the list was published. I lock in my choice but always harbor doubts, not just about the games themselves but most of all about my own ambivalent feelings toward them. Those change, evolve, and usually just get more complicated over time.</p>

 <p>Each of those lists would probably be different if I compiled them today. But that’s sort of the point. They are snapshots of what I thought I felt at the time. Maybe they help, even if only slightly, to clarify someone else’s feelings about one of their favorite games of the year. Or, even better, turn them onto something they hadn’t already tried. I know, though, that mostly we all just skim the lists to see how much they overlap with our own, and what we think that says about our own tastes and the other person’s. So if you haven’t already skipped ahead, here are my top games of 2025 in alphabetical order:</p>

 <h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656028"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656028">Sad Socket</figcaption></figure> <p>A beautifully elegant mash-up of minimalist tower defense strategy and roguelike deckbuilding, <em>9 Kings</em> is still in Early Access and already pretty much everything I want it to be. The introduction of a quest mode late in the year basically added an entire second game. Nothing brought me more joy this year than snuggling up on the couch and watching my brain-dead synergies scale in unexpectedly deadly ways.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655381">Embark Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first modern game to get me to break my “no mic with randos” rule. But <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ real trick is just how rewarding it makes playing the multiplayer extraction format as a solo outsider. It does a wonderful job of blending immersive PVE encounters with unpredictable PVP run-ins in a way that adds to the richness of the sci-fi world rather than making it feel like a series of incentive-driven hamster wheels. Solid gunplay, great atmosphere, rewarding progression.</p>

 <h2><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000017750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000017750"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000017750">Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, a tight-knit sci-fi TTRPG, feels practically sprawling compared to the first game. That scope can occasionally get unwieldy or see the game run into pacing issues, but the fusion of dice-roll skill checks and light resource management with branching dialogue and player choice yields an unforgettably grim but evocative voyage through cosmic backwaters on the decline. Never have the stakes been so high for even the most trivial tasks. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> reminded me that letting go is often hard but necessary, and that knowing it isn’t the same thing as actually doing it.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002350"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002350">Image: Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p>Everyone’s favorite French-infused, Unreal Engine 5 reskin of <em>Final Fantasy X</em> is as good as they say. I’m not on board with all of the game’s narrative choices, and I’m less impressed by the apparent novelty of a good JRPG in the year 2025 than some, but<em> Clair Obscur</em> is rock solid in so many departments and sets a new gold-standard for (non-tactical) turn-based combat. The writing and performances are especially superb, and none of it would amount to a hill of beans without the (mostly) excellent soundtrack.</p>

 <h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000896">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If we judged games by merely by the sum of the joy or boredom they produced moment-to-moment, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> would not rank very highly. But games are more than just graphs of the emotions they produce across dozens of hours of playtime.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is an ambitiously chaotic action platforming collectathon that feels incredibly novel for the first five to eight hours, loses all steam and inventiveness in the second and third acts, and then comes roaring back with one of the best closers of any modern Nintendo game. Could <em>Bananza</em> have been more? Probably. Was it enough? Definitely.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001602">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Nightreign</em> is an excellent action-RPG but a top-notch multiplayer game. It uses the superficial trappings of a <em>Fortnite</em>-like battle royale to completely reinvent open-world exploration, problem solving, and the classic FromSoftware boss fight. It’s less like being thrust into an i-frame boot camp than embarking on a road trip where you know the car will lose a tire, run out of gas, and stall out in the worst possible place, but persevere and the place where you break down in the middle of the night will soon begin to feel like the home you never knew you missed.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The best RPG job system to ever do it, combined with an A-tier story and S-tier music, yields an all-time classic that never fails to prove why so many people are still obsessed with it, whether you give it one hour or 20. The remaster is overly cautious with improvements and stingy with new content, but it avoids the cardinal sin of trying and failing to improve on what was already a masterpiece.</p>

 <h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>Last month I went to an Italian restaurant and ordered their Spicy Crab Vodka. The first bite was surprisingly delicious. Every bite after that was equally delicious. The fact that every bite from beginning to end effectively tasted the same did not diminish the dish’s overall effect, or how much I still think about it. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> feels a bit like that. What it lacks in variety or novelty, it more than makes up for with quality, craftmanship, and the confidence to know exactly what it is and be the best version of that. It’s impressively huge and uncompromisingly slick, backed up by great writing and some incredible performances.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of great 2D action games this year. None of them, in scope, precision, and ambition, ultimately held a candle to <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. It incorporates some of the tried-and-true elements of Metroidvanias and Soulslikes but transforms them into a unique, intimate, at times frustratingly galling journey that asks a lot of you but is generous with its rewards. It’s not perfect, but the flaws it does have only come into focus because of everything else it nails. On my deathbed a snow globe will slip from my hands and crash onto the floor as I mutter the name “Bell Beast.”</p>

 <h2><em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000005179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005179">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never a good sign when I want to start off an entry with some sort of acknowledgement of a game’s biggest weakness, but maybe it’s a testament to just how insanely smartly designed <em>Split Fiction</em> is that its trite premise and often grating banter did not substantially detract from the whole experience. <em>Split Fiction</em> is so effortlessly good at what it does, it makes it easy to overlook just how infrequent it is to get such a tightly paced, well-balanced action-adventure, particularly one that keeps finding ingenious ways to one-up itself all the way through to the very end.</p>

            <guid>1394074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Before <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was released in 2024, the most recent <strong>Silent Hill</strong> game was technically P.T. in 2014, the famous teaser that never became a full project. Before that, it was Silent Hill: Book of Memories on the PS Vita. Whether you count P.T. or not, that's still at least a decade between releases. Now, after Silent Hill 2 Remake in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">now Silent Hill f in 2025</a>, we've had two Silent Hill games in two years, and according to <strong>Konami</strong>, the company wants to keep that pace up if it can.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923?page=7">Famitsu</a> (via machine translation), producer <strong>Motoi Okamoto</strong> says the company is aiming "<em>to release about one [Silent Hill] title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles</em>," turning the long-dormant horror series into an annual franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Okamoto doesn't call this goal a new mandate for the company and the franchise. It doesn't seem to be the case that he wants Konami to have a Call of Duty-style development pipeline to ensure that they can pump out a new game on an annual basis. But he describes it as a goal the company would like to hit, in an effort to "<em>keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following the release of Silent Hill 2 in October 2024, we were able to deliver Silent Hill f in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track. We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We're not sure how far we can achieve this, but we'll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we'd like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>Could Konami set up its own production pipeline to make its horror franchise an annual series? Sure, it could; it's definitely a big enough company, and it could easily throw money at both establishing teams of developers internally and contracting other studios to make new games in the franchise each year. </p>



<p>It even theoretically has another two years of leeway to set up such a pipeline, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Bloober Team already working on a remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>, which could arrive in 2027, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">Silent Hill: Townfall set to arrive in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Is that what it should try to do with the series? That's a different question with a different, and more complex answer. Trying to push out new games in the series before they're ready could be the noose that Konami ties itself and hangs the series on. A quick glance at any game franchise that has annual releases, like EA Sports titles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty,</a> shows that you can't possibly keep up the level of quality we've seen, even with the previous two titles, year-in and year-out.</p>



<p>Keeping "<em>the buzz</em>," as Okamoto describes it, around the series, a constant factor could arguably be hampered by trying to release a new game every year. Especially as the quality of releases degrades, as it is likely to do with a new release annually. If Bloober Team is able to release the remake of the first game by 2027, and Townfall makes its rumoured 2026 release, then we'll see where Konami is at in 2027 with making what Okamoto describes as an ideal a reality.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/these-are-the-guys-who-brought-gta-v-s-thug-trio-to-lif-1333412658">Actor Ned Luke,</a> who portrays Michael De Santa in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and <em>GTA Online,</em> has been swatted a lot. In fact, he gets swatted so often that in a recent clip going viral online, it appears that he and one of the officers checking on the call know each other by name after so many run-ins.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2651379727?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=0h37m32s">during a <em>GTA Online</em> livestream with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> voice actor Rob Wiethoff</a>, Ned Luke was swatted by someone. While Luke played the game live on Twitch, two police officers were invited into his house by someone. One of the officers then yelled out to Luke, “You’re being swatted again!” as he entered the room. Here’s the clip from the December 23 stream as shared by YouTube channel IceBladeNinja.</p>  <div> <p>Swatting is the act of calling the police on someone who is streaming in the hopes that law enforcement will arrest or disrupt the content creator. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting#Injuries_or_deaths_due_to_swatting">It’s a dangerous thing to do</a> in a country like the United States, which has armed officers ready to open fire.</p> <p>This most recent swatting incident for Luke happened about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nedluke/clip/BloodyEnergeticVanillaHoneyBadger-tg-qEFmBN165JTKk">30 minutes into the stream</a>. After a short and friendly chat with law enforcement, Luke continued broadcasting on Twitch for another hour and a half. Based on publicly posted information from the actor, this appears to be at least the eighth time since late 2023 that the 67-year-old has been swatted while streaming online. That might explain why the police officers in the clip above seem so chill, and one of them appears to be on a first-name basis with the actor.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-michael-actor-ned-luke-swatted-while-playing-on-thanksgiving-stream">In November 2023, on Thanksgiving,</a> Luke was swatted. He posted about the incident online, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1728128625734742489">claiming it was the sixth time</a> it had happened to him due to his private details, like his address, being leaked online in the past. <a href="https://gamevro.com/ned-luke-gta-5-voice-actor-swatted-again-livestream/">On December 29, 2023</a>, Luke was once again swatted, this time with police officers calling him and asking the actor to step outside. ‘</p> <p>Hopefully Luke won’t have to put up with frequent swatting in the future. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSv1RJVkezG/">On December 27, the actor posted on Instagram</a> that at least one person involved with swatting him was now facing federal charges and would be in court in January of 2026 over their alleged swatting activity. “Fuck around and find out,” said Luke on Instagram. “Many more names discovered and provided.”</p> </div>
