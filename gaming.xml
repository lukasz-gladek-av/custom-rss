            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> developers Behaviour Interactive have announced that they're acquiring Red Hook, the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon</a>. This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">laid off a bunch of people</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dead-by-daylight-spin-off-project-t-has-been-cancelled/">cancelled a game</a> and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after snapping up a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Red Hook will remain "a fully independent studio" under Behaviour, according to a definition of "independent" that has yet to be shared in full. "Darkest Dungeon has long been a series we've admired, enjoyed (and maybe even lost a little sleep over) as fans, and the opportunity to welcome Red Hook as a fully independent studio under the Behaviour banner is nothing short of a thrill," reads <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1838533897698603388">a statement on social media</a>. "We look forward to supporting Red Hook as they continue to do what they do best: put your sanity to the test." 
</p>
<p>
In a separate release, Behaviour CEO and co-founder Rémi Racine characterised the move as, essentially, a corporate exercise in adopting a fresh child because your festering, stay-at-home, gimlet-eye son needs a new playmate, bless him. "Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher - to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games," he wrote. "Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come." 
</p>
<p>
'Surrounds', eh? I'd keep your distance, Red Hook. If there's one thing Dead By Daylight is known for, it's cannibalising characters from other horror fictions. They said the Alien couldn't be tamed, Red Hook. I give it two months before the Entity abducts Wayne June and turns him into DLC.
</p>
<p>
Red Hook themselves seem happy with the arrangement, as you'd expect. In the same press release, co-founder Chris Bourassa described Behaviour as "kindred spirits", because "both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games". 
</p>
<p>
"The benefit from Red Hook's Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities," Bourassa added. "Behaviour's support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook's future, and focus fully on transforming Darkest Dungeon into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre."
</p>
<p>
Again, I'm not clear on how the 'independence' thing works here in practice - what will Behaviour do, besides providing development funds? They've confirmed that all 29 of Red Hook's existing team have been retained, at least.
</p>
<p>
Acquisitions aside, Red Hook are currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-strategy-game-kingdoms-update-is-coming-in-three-parts-with-the-first-due-in-2024">a kingdom-sized expansion for Darkest Dungeon 2</a> that turns it into a turn-based boardgame.

These moments look cheap, rushed, and more in line with a spam ad for a fake mobile game than the rest of the game’s vibrant pixel art.</p><p>They are, frankly, a mess that feels weirdly inserted into the rest of what looks like dutiful but competent proceedings. The scenes might be better ripped out of the game entirely, if it weren’t for how entertaining they are to encounter while watching others play on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/the-karate-kid-street-rumble&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/the-karate-kid-street-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QledgZk3y2Q&amp;t=1432s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QledgZk3y2Q&amp;t=1432s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span>.

Maybe that’s why the game has fewer than 10 user reviews on Steam, with many of the ones that do exist expressing shock at the price tag juxtaposed with the bad cutscene art. </p><p>“The first problem I noticed was in the very first cut scene at the start of stage 1,” wrote on Steam reviewer. “If you are going to charge $40 for your licensed game, please at least get Daniel to actually look like Daniel and not some 30 year old random guy. I encourage everyone to take a short break from this review, go to YouTube, Google a long play of this, and watch the first cutscene. It is so bad it is worth witnessing for yourself.”</p></div><p>Hopefully the game eventually gets a steep price cut from publisher GameMill Entertainment, so that more people actually get to see the small Argentina-based team Odaclick Game Studio’s beautiful pixel art.

Instead, you have a set number of perk slots on each mask you equip, and you’ll need to manually go in and equip your perks on each loadout.</p><p>You can do this at any reality thread (this game’s version of bonfires) that you visit along your journey, so be sure to swap them around when you buy powerful new options from the Path of Innovators.</p><h2 id="h7056"><a id=""></a><strong>The Preparedness perk is awesome</strong></h2><p>Speaking of perks, I must recommend Preparedness. This perk is unlocked from the get-go and provides your character with a really cool passive ability. With Preparedness equipped, you’ll Unravel enemies slightly when dodging their attacks.</p><p>This can be surprisingly useful, particularly early in your adventure while you’re still learning the ropes, as it will typically apply enough Unravel to weak foes to stun them with a single well-timed dodge. In turn, this opens them up for a nice critical attack certain to drain their health.</p><h2 id="h7057"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast travel is unlocked from the beginning</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-recommend-id="image://1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jyamma Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-recommend-id="image://1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike many soulslike titles, which force you to reach a certain point in the story to unlock fast travel, <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em> offers you the ability to teleport between reality knots from the very beginning.</p><p>As such, you’re able to revisit any previously explored areas that felt a bit difficult during the first few hours, so that you can show those enemies your new-found power with a few more levels under your belt.</p><h2 id="h7058"><a id=""></a><strong>Farm any crabs you come across</strong></h2><p>You’ll come across some crab enemies very early in the game, and they’re an excellent source of Memoria (XP). While they only grant 40 Memoria per kill individually, they have a relatively decent chance of dropping consumable items called Valuable Shells, which can be used to receive 2,000 Memoria at once. That’s a hell of a lot of XP during the first area of the game.</p><p>If you want to tackle these little crabs, fast travel to the Shores of Quinta reality thread. Turn around from where you spawn, and head into the little beach cave behind you where three of these enemies will be waiting. Slay them and hope for a Valuable Shell, then rinse and repeat as necessary.</p><h2 id="h7059"><a id=""></a><strong>Ranged attacks can be parried</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of pesky archers scattered throughout <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em>, but if you can get a feel for the timing of their shots, there’s some good news: You can parry them.</p><p>Even better, parrying the arrows of the weak archers will automatically Unravel them and allow you to approach for a one-shot kill. Hell yeah.</p><h2 id="h7060"><a id=""></a><strong>Get prepared before fighting the first major boss</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-recommend-id="image://bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Getting ready to battle Curtis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Getting ready to battle Curtis." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jyamma Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-recommend-id="image://bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Getting ready to battle Curtis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game’s first major boss, Curtis, isn’t necessarily an overwhelmingly difficult encounter, but he hits like a truck, meaning a few missed dodges or parries can land you in a bad spot.</p><p>I’d really recommend that you aim to have around 20 points in your Bruiser stat to raise your health and defense, 20 points in your damage stat of choice, and a weapon leveled to at least +3 before you head in and fight him. You can farm the aforementioned crabs for Valuable Shells if you’re looking for Memoria to make all of this happen.</p><h2 id="h7061"><a id=""></a><strong>Weapon upgrade materials can be refunded</strong></h2><p>And hey, don’t worry about any materials you’ve used on leveling a weapon early in the game. If you find something else you prefer later on, you can head to an anvil and enter the weapon upgrade menu, then select “Refund” to receive all of the materials back for use on another armament of your choosing.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, you won’t be refunded any Memoria you invested. However, that shouldn’t be a huge deal as the game rolls on—it’s much more plentiful later.</p><h2 id="h7062"><a id=""></a><strong>Yes, you can respec…later</strong></h2><p>Lastly, you should absolutely try to design your character’s stats in a way that best suits your early game build, but don’t worry if you find that you’ve tossed a point or two in the wrong place while experimenting. While I won’t spoil how, you will find an NPC later in the game that will let you respec, so you’ll be able to fix up your stat spread mistakes—or completely reevaluate your build if you prefer.</p><hr><p>Good luck out there in the beautiful but dangerous world of <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em>. You’re going to need it!<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T1 recently celebrated its twentieth anniversary, looking back on two decades of success as an esports organisation. Over many years, T1 has become one of the most recognisable brands in the industry, boasting multi-million-dollar wins, rockstar players, and iconography that millions of fans feel proud to represent.</p>



<p>During ESI Lisbon, T1’s CEO and COO took to the stage to reflect on the last 20 years before pivoting and focusing on what comes next for the legendary organisation.</p>



<p>It seems that the company’s leadership team is going all in with Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-here-to-stay">‘It’s Here to Stay’</h2>



<p>At ESI Lisbon, T1’s CEO, Joe Marsh, and the firm’s COO, Josh Ahn, graced the stage to deliver a presentation focused on the company’s success over the last two decades. Marsh had bold things to say about the future of the esports industry, which T1 has spent many years trying to spearhead:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports is the new version of sports for the younger generation, and it’s here to stay.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair revealed that in the past five years, they’ve increased T1’s revenue by 3300%, even during COVID-19, which saw many organisations face a massive downturn. From a business perspective, Ahn revealed that T1’s merchandise sales are posed to overtake the revenue earned from sponsorships for the first time, which is a huge deal.</p>



<p>Typically, most revenue in the esports space is made up of advertising and sponsorships. This is a testament to the power of the T1 brand and the popularity of the product, particularly in South Korea.</p>



<p>Ahn then explained that they’re putting more eggs in the ‘Faker basket’. Faker has long been a superstar of the esports industry and has been branded the GOAT by many millions of fans. He’s one of the most instantly recognisable competitors on the planet, and his passion is nothing short of intense and inspirational.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to make something similar to the Jordan brand but with Faker.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ahn was referring to Michael Jordan’s prolific partnership with Nike, which was kickstarted in 1984. It’s now worth almost $7 billion to Nike.</p>



<p>It’s tough to see Faker-branded products hitting those lofty heights, but there should be a comparable success, downscaled a little to accommodate for the still-growing market that is esports. He remains one of the most appreciated and storied competitors in the business, so if anyone can do it, it’s him.</p>



<p>T1 recently landed in the top spot at the inaugural Esports World Cup, a win that came months after a victory at the League of Legends World Championship. The team is now preparing to go back-to-back at this year’s LoL Worlds, which starts tomorrow.</p>



<p>Do you think Faker is an iconic enough player to have a successful lifestyle brand built in his image? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>Sony's decision to require a PlayStation Network sign-in for the PC port of the single-player <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>&nbsp;is drawing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/zeosg2/god_of_war_rag_being_review_bombed_on_metacritic/">expected levels</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1d4gnpe/god_of_war_ragnarok_pc_requires_a_psn_account/">ire</a> from frustrated PC gamers. Now, though, those angry players can actually do something about the problem thanks to a new mod that removes the PSN log-in requirement from the game entirely.</p>
<p>The NoPSSDK mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">hosted on NexusMods</a>, promises to "fully strip the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement for God of War Ragnarok." The <a href="https://github.com/iArtorias/nopssdk">open source mod</a> makes use of a simple <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Detours">Microsoft Detours</a> library to get around the game's calls to the PlayStation Network API without "touch[ing] or modify[ing] any original game code."</p>
<p>The mod, which has already seen one update related to simulating offline mode, has been downloaded just under 2,000 times as of this writing. "I will try to maintain the tool even if something changes, but hopefully nothing crucial happens," mod author iArtorias <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=posts">wrote in a NexusMods post</a>.</p>
<h2>Not a new problem</h2>
<p>Sony initially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/sony-will-soon-demand-helldivers-2-players-on-steam-have-psn-accounts/">required a PSN account to play the PC version of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a> in May, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/sony-backs-down-wont-enforce-psn-accounts-for-helldivers-2-pc-players-on-steam/">backed off of that requirement</a> after just a few days of widespread complaints among the player base. Weeks later, though, the PC release of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">did require a PSN account</a> to access the game's online multiplayer Legends mode.
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gowpsn.png" data-height="780" data-width="1284" alt="With the mod installed, simply clicking &quot;No&quot; lets you play the game without a PSN login."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gowpsn.png" data-height="780" data-width="1284">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> With the mod installed, simply clicking "No" lets you play the game without a PSN login.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike those recent Sony PC ports, though, <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>&nbsp;is a completely offline, single-player game that nonetheless requires a PSN sign-in for access. It's a difference that thousands of negative user reviews are <a>angrily pointing out on Steam</a>, often with links to the NoPSSDK mod for good measure.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"The game is amazing and I'm really enjoying it, however I can't recommend it in its current state," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198197991033/recommended/2322010/">one representative Steam review</a> reads. "A single player game requiring a Sony PSN login and not being able to play it offline? Really Sony? Are you serious?"</p>
<p>Sony's PSN requirement, which was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-coming-to-pc/">first announced back in May</a>, subjects players to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psn-terms-of-service/">Sony's PlayStation Terms of Service</a> in addition to those of the PC storefront. The requirement also effectively limits the game's sales to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-countries-have-psn/">the 70 countries where PSN accounts are available</a>.</p>
<p>PC ports have been an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/sony-estimates-its-pc-games-sales-will-jump-375-over-next-year/">increasingly important</a> part of Sony's gaming strategy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/sony-estimates-its-pc-games-sales-will-jump-375-over-next-year/">for years now</a>, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/playstationstudios">15 high-profile, big-budget titles</a> making the jump from PlayStation to Steam since 2020. "The strategy as we were developing it when I was there was that we need to go out to where these new customers are, where these new fans could be," former Sony executive Shawn Layden <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/ex-sony-exec-opens-up-about-efforts-to-bring-playstation-hits-to-pc/">said in 2021</a>. "We need to go to where they are..."

                <p>Sony is expanding its catalog of gaming monitors today with the reveal of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Compatible-DisplayHDR-Anti-Glare-DisplayPort/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M10S</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Monitor-DisplayHDR-Speakers/dp/B0D9R8YPK3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M9 II</a>. The M10S is designed as a premium, tournament-ready display--in fact, it was created in collaboration with esports team Fnatic to ensure it checked all the right boxes for professionals. The Inzone M9 II, meanwhile, is the successor to the existing M9 and should be a nice companion for your PS5.</p><h2>Sony Inzone M10S</h2><h3>$1,100</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371850-1727110173-b8706db7b3c1143a529c0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371850" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371850-1727110173-b8706db7b3c1143a529c0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371850"></a><figcaption>The Sony Inzone M10S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371850-1727110173-b8706db7b3c1143a529c0.jpg"></figure><p>Though it’s quite expensive, the Inzone M10S is packed with features that make it a great choice for competitive gamers. Along with a large 27-inch OLED display and 1440p resolution, it supports a blistering 480Hz refresh rate, up to 0.03ms response time, and comes with an adjustable stand that lets you quickly tilt or swivel the display. Of course, it also comes with both DisplayPort and HDMI inputs.</p><p>It’s also noticeably compact. Built with a 159mm-diameter base that’s just 4mm thick, it should free up plenty of space on your desktop for your mouse and keyboard. Here are the rest of the monitor's specs:</p><ul><li>DisplayHDR True Black 400</li><li>1300-nits HDR peak brightness</li><li>Custom heat sink</li><li>Nvidia G-Sync compatible</li></ul><hr><h2>Sony Inzone M9 II</h2><h3>$800</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371851-m9llfront.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4371851" data-ratio="0.561" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371851-m9llfront.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4371851"></a><figcaption>The Sony Inzone M9 II</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371851-m9llfront.jpeg"></figure><p>Despite its lower price, the Inzone M9 II actually offers a better resolution than the M10S. Its 4K IPS display gets you a refresh rate of 160Hz, a 1ms response rate, and support for both DisplayPort and HDMI. Like its more expensive sibling, it comes with a stand that swivels and tilts. Sony gave the M9 II a refreshed design as well. Unlike the original M9, which was a nice complement to PS5 with its white and black paint job, the new monitor is all black.</p><p>This monitor is a better choice for PS5 gaming than the M10S, as the M10S only supports resolutions up to 1440p. Best of all, the M9 II received a price cut--the original M9 retailed for $900, but this new model is just $800.</p><p>Here are the rest of the monitor's specs:</p><ul><li>Full array local dimming</li><li>Backlight scanning technology</li><li>750 nits HDR peak brightness</li><li>VESA Certified DisplayHDR 600</li><li>Nvidia G-Sync compatible</li></ul><hr><p>If you’re interested in the old M9 and its dual-color design, you might want to snag it while you can. It appears that the M9 II will be replacing its predecessor, so it’s unclear how much longer inventory will be available at retailers.</p><p>Though it’s not new, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B6KHVR3K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony Inzone M3</a> is still a great option if you need a mid-tier display for your battlestation. It’s currently on sale for <strong>$498 (was $530)</strong>, and it gets you a 27-inch display, 1080p resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and Auto HDR Tone Mapping when connected to your PS5. Consider giving it a closer look if these new monitors are a bit too expensive for your needs.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>   </ul> </div>

In this DLC, players will return to N'Erud and uncover a new location that has been preserved in time, where there are alien farmlands that are cared for by robots, as the previous inhabitants are long dead. However, rogue AI and robots are threatening while Travelers search for the secrets of the entity that dominates the skyline. In this storyline, players need to work to uncover the secrets hidden within N'Erud, where players will get to explore new dungeons, as well as a glider traversal system that isn't found in any of the other worlds. In addition, there will be new powerful gear to obtain, as well as "The Warden" archetype.</p>
<p>The Warden is all about enhancing your playstyle, and is accompanied by The Drone, which can shield, heal and attack enemies.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHz22PggehA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> A trailer</a> has been released explaining the new archetype in detail.</p>
<p>Regarding the Boss Rush update, players will be able to choose whether to play the mode by themselves, or alongside fellow Travelers via multiplayer, where they can choose from three different difficulty options. It includes a three-boss run, a seven-boss run, and a nineteen-boss run, and the game mode can be accessed by heading to the World Stone in Ward 13.</p>
<p>Alongside the Boss Rush update, there are new quality-of-life improvements, as well as a new system called Prisms. This feature rebalances the fragment system, and can add additional levels to give you stat bonuses as you explore the worlds of Remnant II.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has explained why Princess Zelda is the protagonist of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and it turns out that she wasn't always intended to be the star of the game.</p>
<p>In the latest&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> Ask the Developer interview, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-dungeon-maker">follows on from yesterday's</a>, producer Eiji Aonuma sits down alongside directors Tomomi Sano and Satoshi Terada to answer more questions about the upcoming top-down action-adventure game.</p>
<p>Aonuma says that initially, the team planned Link to be&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s protagonist, but given the "copy-and-paste" gameplay style, the developers quickly found that Link's sword and shield "got in the way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist-fighting.jpg?itok=EVto1fM4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist-fighting.jpg?itok=sjN7fRR5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>had to star Zelda for a very specific reason.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Aonuma, the team realized that "if you have a sword and shield, you can just fight using those", and that there would be no need for the echo system if Link simply had weapons.</p>
<p>Terada then chips in to say that the team originally considered having Link only be able to use echoes to begin with and unlocking the sword and shield later, but then they realized that "once [players] got the sword and shield, they would stop using echoes".</p>
<p>This led to a realization that the protagonist of&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>would need to be a character that didn't fight with a sword and shield, which is where Zelda comes in.</p>
<p>Aonuma says that he and the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>team have been asked many times over the years whether Zelda would be the protagonist of her own story, and when he saw the team "struggling to identify"&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s ideal protagonist, he realized it would be "exactly the game" for Zelda.</p>

<p>Later in the interview, Aonuma says that he and the team "had no intention of establishing any new theories" in&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>lore with&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, so don't expect any earth-shattering timeline revelations.</p>
<p>It's well worth reading <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full conversation</a> with Aonuma, Sano, and Terada, especially if you're a&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>fan, as it's got some very enlightening tidbits of information regarding&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s development and the series as a whole.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26th. Check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom">our preview of the game here</a> to find out whether we think its more creative and freeform approach will pay off.</p>

In addition, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/">announced</a> new chromatic options for the D-pads and paddles. Prices start at $149.99 for a custom design, but you’ll pay extra for some options.</p><p>The new translucent faceplate options are white (Ghost Cipher), green (Velocity Cipher), purple (Astral Cipher), blue (Surf Cipher), pink (Candy Cipher), and red (Pulse Cipher) options. Meanwhile, you can choose Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma for the paddles and D-pad. </p><p>Microsoft also released a new standalone <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fghost-cipher-special-edition">Ghost Cipher edition</a> of the standard Xbox Wireless Controller that’s much more transparent than the Elite options (the Elite rubberized grips keep the translucence from extending past the faceplate). It’ll set you back $69.99 when it arrives on October 8th, and preorders begin today. Click through the gallery below for that controller and examples of the Elite Cipher Series options.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft’s new transparent options for the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Xbox Design Lab</cite></p></div></div><p>The Xbox Design Lab is fantastic if you, like me, are a person who thinks gadget design takes itself too seriously most of the time. I particularly like the challenge of making something as garish as possible, so I’d end up creating something like the below images if I could bring myself to pay for it.

Annoying, but makes sense. However, in this case, Sony is asking PC players who already have a Steam account to create a separate account on a different video game service just so they can play by themselves. That’s silly. And I expect players will continue to mod these odd single-player PSN requirements out of any future PS5 and PS4 ports that arrive on Steam. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[N0tail On The Esports Industry: ‘Games Are Not Going Anywhere’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/notail-esi-lisbon-esports-industry/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/n0tail-on-the-esports-industry-%E2%80%98games-are-not-going-anywhere%E2%80%99.990261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/notail-esi-lisbon-esports-industry/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Johan ‘N0tail’ Sundstein has done it all. He’s the highest-earning esports player of all time, he has secured some of the most prolific trophies in competitive gaming, and he contributed to the foundation of both OG Esports and Team Secret. He was named in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 and started competing at just fifteen years of age.</p>



<p>Sundstein took to the stage at ESI Lisbon to appear in a ‘fireside chat’, clueing the audience in about his experiences with the esports industry and how he thinks everything is going, given recent struggles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-stabilising">‘It’s Stabilising’</h2>



<p>Johan Sundstein is perhaps one of the best-placed individuals to talk about the esports industry. He has been there since the sudden uptick took place that saw millions of fans pulled into the esports ecosystem, and he has contributed more to the industry than almost every other personality in the space.</p>



<p>Speaking at ESI Lisbon, Sundstein said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Where we’re at now, I think when esports went really high up a lot of investments were made, but I will also say that probably a lot of money was burnt. And now, I think it’s stabilising a bit. It went down, COVID happened to everyone, but I think we’re seeing a lot of interest from different regions in the world that are also ready to invest.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The esports industry has wavered in recent years in terms of financial struggles, viewership, and the need for organisations to diversify as much as possible just to make ends meet. There are a few outliers standing firm against that line of thinking, though. For instance, last year’s League of Legends World Championship event broke peak records, pulling in more than six million concurrent viewers.</p>



<p>N0tail remains optimistic – and more importantly, <strong>realistic</strong>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think games are not going anywhere. For as long as humans have been around, we’ve been practising sports and games in different shapes and forms. As long as we are around, I think people will continue to make games and those games will only continue to get better.</p>



<p>I think the future is electronic, mostly. I don’t think sports is going anywhere, like it’s not going to die off, but I do think that the majority of our new games will be digital and electronic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sundstein remarked that ‘we’re all in the same boat’, speaking about fans, spectators, organisers, and even team leaders and founders like himself. He said, ‘We’re all the same people in the same boat trying to enjoy the same thing together.’ </p>

                <p>Microsoft is leveraging the aesthetic power of the 2000s for its newly announced Xbox Ghost Cipher wireless controller. While the internals remain the same, externally is where this controller shines, as it sports a transparent clear design, silver interior, metallic features, and more. This will be available starting October 8, and it's priced at $70 through the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/ghost-cipher-special-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Store</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371831-xbox-ghost-cipher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371831-xbox-ghost-cipher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371831"></a><figcaption>Xbox Ghost Cipher controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371831-xbox-ghost-cipher.jpg"></figure><p>This isn't the first time that Microsoft has released a transparent Xbox controller--the Xbox 20th-anniversary controller combined a darker transparent shell with green highlights and the <em>very blue </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Special-Windows-Devices/dp/B09Z7J4L6X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Sky Cipher released earlier this year</a>--but this design does allow you to get a really good look at what's inside of the peripheral. The clear transparent top case is complemented by metallic and silver interior parts that shine through from the inside, while the bronze metallic triggers, matching D-pad, and ash grey rubberized grips add some elegant finishing touches.</p><p>Beyond that, this is the same Xbox controller that was introduced four years ago. It's still a reliable jack-of-all-trades device, as it has a robust construction, durable face buttons, and a useful share button. These work not only on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles but also wirelessly on PC and smartphones via a Bluetooth connection. While it may not be as advanced as Sony's DualSense controller, this is still a comfortable device to use for long gaming stretches. It also has an excellent battery life, and you can choose to use regular AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371835-xbox-cipher-series.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371835" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371835-xbox-cipher-series.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371835"></a><figcaption>Xbox Controller Cipher series</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371835-xbox-cipher-series.jpg"></figure><p>Over at the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/xboxdesignlab.xbox.com" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Design Lab</a>, you can also create your own custom transparent Elite Series 2 controller. This is a nostalgic collection inspired by '90s and 2000s technology, and there are several retro-modern designs to choose from in the expanded Cipher series: Velocity, Astral, Surf, Candy, and Purple Cipher.</p><p>In addition to the Cipher Series, there are also two new chromatic D-pad and paddle designs--Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma--that add even more colors to the controllers.</p>

                <p>Developer Shift Up and publisher Sony are being sued by a film production company in Louisiana called Stellarblade over the name of the PlayStation exclusive Stellar Blade.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Stellarblade and its owner, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, are suing Shift Up and Sony, both for damages and to prevent the name from being used further. This includes asking that they both stop using the Stellar Blade name or any similar names, as well as handing over all materials in their possession with the name "Stellar Blade" so that they can be destroyed.</p><p>In the lawsuit, Mehaffey claimed that he has owned the <a href="https://www.stellarblade.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stellarblade.com</a> domain name since 2006 and that the company started in 2010. Shift Up registered the name Stellar Blade as a video-game-related trademark in January 2023, while Mehafffey registered his own for Stellarblade in June. A month later, he then claimed to sent a cease-and-desist letter to Shift Up.</p><p>Mehaffey also claimed that when customers look for Stellarblade on the internet, information about Stellar Blade now completely overtakes search results. Furthermore, he alleged that the "S" styling Stellar Blade's logo looks too similar to his own Stellarblade's.</p><p>"Mr. Mehaffey registered the stellarblade.com domain in 2006 and has used the STELLARBLADE name for his business for nearly 15 years. Given this long-standing and public use, it's difficult to imagine that Shift Up and Sony were unaware of Mr. Mehaffey's established rights before adopting their identical mark," Mehaffey's lawyer said in a statement to IGN.</p><p>They continued, "We believe in fair competition, but when larger companies disregard the established rights of smaller businesses, it's our responsibility to stand up and protect our brand. The defendants’ far superior resources have effectively monopolized online search results for STELLARBLADE, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade."</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stellar-blade-review-nier-as-it-can-get/1900-6418215/" data-ref-id="1900-6418215">Stellar Blade review,</a> we said, "A strong battle system and exciting moments make Stellar Blade more than just an imitator."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/breaking-down-gta-v-s-pedestrian-dialogue-system-an-analysis-with-speculative-examples<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p>GTA V's pedestrian dialogue system fills out the game's soundscape.<span>Rockstar Games</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is Ambient &amp; Pedestrian Dialogue?">What is Ambient &amp; Pedestrian Dialogue?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For massive AAA games like the Grand Theft Auto series or Cyberpunk 2077, it’s not enough to only write dialogue for player-facing events, like quests, cutscenes, and ally conversations. To make a game world at this scale feel “alive”, NPC’s must be conversing amongst themselves without the player’s involvement, giving them a sense of independent agency. The best way to convey this agency? Incorporate ambient dialogue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ambient, or pedestrian, dialogue can be broadly defined as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>dialogue that plays without direct player input from the general NPC population</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Standard dialogue in a game is player-initiated, i.e. a player walks up to an NPC, presses a button prompt, and starts conversing with that character. Ambient dialogue, instead, occurs autonomously, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzHYESXYf4g">regardless of the player’s presence</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Does GTA V Implement Ambient Dialogue?">How Does GTA V Implement Ambient Dialogue?</h2><p>The ambient dialogue system uses a number of subsystems working in tandem, like NPC spawn zones. Source: Rockstar Games</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Note: this is an educated inference on how Grand Theft Auto V structures their pedestrian dialogue system. This is not meant to be a definitive, wholly accurate summary.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned earlier, colossal-sized games like Grand Theft Auto V relies on using pedestrian dialogue to fill out the game’s soundscape and make Los Santos feel like a real metropolis. GTA V would feel significantly more empty without NPC’s, for example, asking for help feeding their 57 cats. These small, passing one-offs from the pedestrian population are an often overlooked, but critical part of the game’s interactivity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="NPC Spawn Zones">NPC Spawn Zones</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A core part of how GTA V’s ambient dialogue system works relies on a connected, underlying mechanism: the NPC spawn system. Different NPC’s have a higher likelihood of spawning in certain sections of Los Santos than others, such as businessmen NPC’s primarily appearing around Rockford Hills, or country bumpkins spawning mainly in Grapeseed and Blaine County.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="NPC Archetypes">NPC Archetypes</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To conserve resources during production, Rockstar chose not to create individual dialogue pools per NPC, but rather created “archetypes” of NPC’s. Forest rangers, muscleheads, wannabe celebrities, Rockstar formulated several roles like these and created </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcwuD5DEdU">dialogue corresponding to their stereotype</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then recorded male and female voiceover for each.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="“General Purpose” Dialogue">“General Purpose” Dialogue</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To stretch the use of these character archetypes further, Rockstar made the decision to not incorporate any location-specific voice lines in its pedestrian dialogue system. While this may make some ambient remarks from passerby NPC’s feel plain, this decision helped to simplify the archetype logic by not having to create location-based variations for each role (ex. having one generic rich person NPC vs. having specific ones for Vinewood, Rockford Hills, Vespucci, etc.).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This methodology also applies to characters conversing with one another. When an NPC is being talked to by another NPC, they will typically respond with a very brief (often disjunct) line, which ends the conversation (“What?”, “Who cares!”, “Unbelievable!”, etc.). Like before, this is to get the maximum amount of use from each recorded line, and helps to simplify the system logic running these random NPC dialogue events.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Dialogue Pools">Dialogue Pools</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regardless of what archetype an NPC is, or where they spawned, each of them has a set “pool” of voice lines to pull from. For instance, every NPC has at least one or two lines to react to the player getting too close to them, aiming a gun at them, hitting their car, and more. This not only simplifies the writers’ jobs by giving them a “checklist” of lines to write for each archetype, but also ensures that any NPC can properly interact with the player, while also having a healthy pool of ambient lines to say while walking around Los Santos.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Put It All Together">Put It All Together</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all these systems in mind, the basis of Grand Theft Auto V’s NPC system can be inferred. When the game spawns an NPC, the following steps (not necessarily in order) are executed:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1.) What archetype is this NPC?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Depending on the spawn zone the player is currently in, certain types of NPC’s will be much more likely to spawn then others.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2.) What are the general characteristics of this NPC?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The archetype selected may limit the range of possible characteristics. For example, if the archetype is LSPD Cop, then “Elderly” would not be one of the possible characteristics.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3.) Find the dialogue pool asset that matches the selected characteristics and archetype. This can be boiled down to indexing a specific folder using each attribute selected (ex. index the audio asset folder path named “Cop_Male_White_Young”).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssoVhPB162g">4.)

My goal for the future is similar: recreate Rockstar’s pedestrian dialogue system within an Unreal sample project, as a way of delving further into its mechanics on a programmatic level. This will necessarily entail a few other subsystems, like a randomize NPC spawner, NPC AI BehaviorTrees for routes and player reactions, and more. However, I believe this will be a fun, informative challenge, and something that I (or others, once released to GitHub) could plug into their full-fledged projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://randenbanuelosdev.wixsite.com/home">https://randenbanuelosdev.wixsite.com/home</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What are you doing tonight at 11pm UK time? That's right, watching Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play broadcast right here with us. We'll keep you up to date with everything that happens in a blow by blow account, and we would love to have you chat along with us as you watch the stream and tell us what you think.</p>
<p>The show begins at 11pm UK time (3pm PT) and is embedded below, and it runs for around half an hour, so it's blessedly brief. Despite that, Sony has promised to pack in more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PSVR2 games, some of them new, some of them getting updates.</p>
<p>What do we expect? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-announced-via-playstation-listing">the Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 remaster because it leaked ahead of the show</a>. But also probably the Until Dawn remake, and probably the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, after it was confirmed as a PlayStation exclusive the other day. And maybe the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> remaster, and maybe a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> remaster. Yes, we live in a world where remasters and remakes rule (give us Bloodborne you cowards!).</p>
<p>The newly unveiled PS5 Pro will also feature, in all its exorbitant expensiveness, as will myriad announcements of game-enhancements for it. Pre-orders for it open on Thursday 26th September, remember.</p>
<p>The question is, what would you like to see?</p>
<p>See you later on.</p><figure>

Short and sweet: that's how I like my State of Play broadcasts, and that's apparently what we're going to get. Is that enough room for Kojima? Will Geoff Keighley be there somehow? And can anyone afford the PS5 Pro yet? We'll have to wait and see!

            <p>Microsoft is continuing on with its mission to provide us with as many different Xbox controller variants it can.</p>
<p>Today, the company debuted the Ghost Cipher Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controller, which features grey and bronze accents with a clear top case so you can see the controller's inner workings (see header image above)</p>
<p>The Ghost Cipher Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controller will be available from next month, on 8th October, retailing at £64.99. If you are interested in purchasing one for yourself, you can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/ghost-cipher-special-edition">pre-order</a> the controller now.</p>

<p>In addition, Microsoft has also revealed some transparent Cipher Series top cases, along with some chromatic D-pad and paddles, for its Elite Series 2 controllers. These are available via <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-gb/configure/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">Xbox Design Lab</a>.</p>
<p>The top cases are inspired by the "translucent tech of the '90s and early 2000s", which reminds me I once had a transparent inflatable chair that I would stick to uncomfortably but insisted was the best piece of furniture ever whenever my parents gave me a questioning look.</p>
<p>But, I digress! Back to the controller news. "These vibrant, candy-coloured top cases encapsulate the controller’s metallic frame, showcasing both its external beauty and the advanced engineering within the Elite Series 2 controller," a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/">blog post</a> accompanying today's controller announcement reads.</p>
<p>There are six case colours to choose from: Ghost Cipher (colourless), Velocity Cipher (green), Astral Cipher (purple), Surf Cipher (blue), Candy Cipher (pink) and Pulse Cipher (red).</p>
<p>As for those chromatic D-pad and paddle designs, these are called Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma, and promise a "dynamic spectrum" of colour.</p>

<p>"These metallic finishes blend hues to create a hypnotic gradient that shifts depending on the angle, adding a sci-fi, jewellery-like feel to your controller," Microsoft said. "Energy Chroma starts with the signature Xbox green and fades into blues, yellows, and magenta accents, while Sunset Chroma evokes a warm, summery glow with its transition from yellow to bright pink."</p>
<p>You can check out how these controller design options look via the video above.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Microsoft news, the company recently shared an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-green-initiatives-for-xbox-have-saved-over-3bn-car-miles-of-co2-emissions">update on its sustainability efforts on Xbox from the past three years</a>. In that time, the company has reduced its emissions by over 3bn car miles - that's over 1.2m metric tons of CO2e.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newzoos-august-2024-report-reveals-black-myth-wukong-top-grossing-game-across-six-markets/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newzoo's</a> financial report for August 2024 is out, discussing the engagement and revenue rankings for the month. Many of the statistics aren't too surprising, with Black Myth: Wukong dominating the market. Although Black Myth: Wukong was incredibly popular and performed well in revenue, it didn't quite hit the mark regarding MAU (Monthly Active Users) rankings. Despite not performing well in the MAU rankings, it remained first in August and was the top-grossing game in six markets. This was a huge achievement for Game Science, the game developer, as they had only worked on mobile titles previously. The game was #1 on PC and #3 on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Fortnite had the most Monthly Active Users and continued to dominate on that front. However, some other games jumped up the leaderboard significantly, even if it wasn't in the top spot. Fall Guys, Diablo IV, and World of Warcraft jumped up the rankings significantly, as Fall Guys got two new DLCs in July (Carbon Night and Hotdog Fusion), which helped increase the player count. Diablo IV received a 40% discount on Steam, which helped boost the game while experiencing consistent PC engagement drops.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft also saw a huge increase in player count, as the highly anticipated expansion <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">The War Within</a> was released on August 26. This helped boost the game seven spots on the list and put it into the 20th position.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/">VALORANT finally made it to console</a> after being exclusively on PC for four years. The game dropped from #1 to #3 on PC by total revenue, with Black Myth: Wukong taking the top spot. However, VALORANT's engagement went up drastically with the ability to play the game and get cross-progression, and only time will tell whether the game will be a strong contender on console the same way it is on PC.</p>
<p>When looking at all markets and all MAU combined, not a single Nintendo Switch game made it into the top spots. Considering the lack of releases in August, this isn't too surprising. They may emerge victorious by the end of next month's report, as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is due for release, a highly anticipated game for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/">the company</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to sports games, it was a big summer for American football titles. EA Sports College Football 25 was released on July 19 and remains a mainstay on the charts, being in #4 on PlayStation and #3 on Xbox. EA Sports Madden NFL 25 was released on August 16 and is #2 on PlayStation and #1 on Xbox, and they are both continuing to maintain their high rankings on the charts. However, the releases of EA Sports FC 25 and NBA 2K25 are fast approaching, and it may see them knocked off the top spots.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-ices-projects-as-jusant-and-banishers-underperform.990186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has released its financial summary for the first half of 2024, and it paints a pretty gloomy picture for the French studio.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release summarizing the studio's year so far</a>, Don't Nod says its revenue has declined 11% when compared to the same period last year, citing the performance of 2024 releases&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Banishers</em>, which the studio says "performed well below expectations".</p>
<p>Don't Nod says that an increase in sales over last year is "mainly driven by the back catalog", citing&nbsp;<em>Vampyr&nbsp;</em>and the license for&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>in particular, so <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-financials-first-half-2024">just like Team17</a>, Don't Nod isn't having much luck with newer releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden.jpg?itok=WtWPMykv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden.jpg?itok=bY_MFgY0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod's 2024 releases have underperformed so far.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio also says that its revenues won't cover its operating expenses, which means it expects to post a loss of around&nbsp;€1 million for the first half of the year.</p>
<p>In response to its disappointing financial performance, Don't Nod says it's focusing its efforts on the games "offering the highest potential return on investment in the short (and medium) term".</p>
<p>To wit, this involves seeking "discussions" with "industry leaders to secure economic benefits" for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em></a>, which will serve as the debut project for Don't Nod's Montreal studio.</p>
<p>One of Don't Nod's projects, codenamed P10, is being scrapped, while two projects currently in the design phase at the Paris studio are being "temporarily paus[ed]", although they're seemingly not being canceled altogether.</p>

<p>He says Don't Nod is currently "consider[ing] all possible options regarding [its] roadmap", so presumably, nothing is off the table with regards to cancellations or delays. We'll have to wait and see what this means for the studio in both the short term and the long term.</p>

                <p>The parents of Parkland school shooting victim Joaquin Oliver have released a video game, The Final Exam, with the goal of raising awareness and ultimately enacting legislative changes regarding gun control. Manuel "Manny" Oliver and Patricia Oliver lost their 17-year-old son in the February 2018 shooting, which left 14 students and three staff members dead, and another 17 injured. It remains the deadliest high-school shooting in US history.</p><p>The Final Exam sees players step into the shoes of a student navigating an active-shooter situation. Players have 10 minutes to escape the building--a reference to the fact that the average school shooting lasts 10 minutes--but must also collect pieces of gun-control legislation hidden around the school.</p><p>"These halls represent the real-life horrors of hundreds of schools that have suffered mass shootings--places that were promised to be safe for children but were failed by our government," reads a portion of <a href="https://www.thefinalexam.us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official website</a>. "In this game and in real life, gun-control bills are the key to survival. By surviving the game and collecting all the bills, you can demand change and help save thousands of lives in the real world."</p><p>The gun-control bills featured in the game include a ban on assault weapons, mandated safe storage of firearms (also known as Ethan's Law), a ban of high-capacity magazines, mandated background checks for all firearms purchases, and a bill proposing the minimum age to purchase a firearm be raised from 18 years old to 21 years old.</p><p>The game also takes issue with certain politicians' tendency to blame mass shootings on violence in video games. It isn't violent games that make the Olivers fear for students around the country, but the sheer ease with which Americans can obtain deadly weapons with a high rate of fire--regardless of whether they're mentally or emotionally capable of handling those weapons in a safe manner.</p><p>"The clock starts now," the game's site continues. "Let's pressure politicians to do the right thing: Stop blaming games and start taking meaningful action against gun violence."</p><p>The Final Exam is <a href="https://www.thefinalexam.us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for free via its website</a>, where players can also donate to non-profits that support for gun reform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-requirement-modded-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s latest PC game release, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, has been in the spotlight for its requirement that players have an attached PSN account, and the PlayStation overlay that is imposes on the game. Now a mod has been released to remove the PSN overlay and bypass linking Steam and PSN accounts.</p>
<p>The mod – simply called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">NoPSSDK</a> – removes the PSN overlay and makes it so it cannot request account linking. While it works to remove it currently, it’s not clear if Sony can reengineer the overlay in future, and is probably some kind of EULA breach… though since nobody reads those, it’s impossible to know. This also won’t enable gamers from regions not supported by PSN to play, with Sony restricting sales of the game within those countries, just as is now the case with Helldivers 2.</p>


<p>The PSN requirement has been coming for Sony’s games since earlier this year, first featured in Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut, very briefly with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Concord</a>, and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">announced for (and then pulled) from Helldivers 2</a>. All of these games have one thing in common: cross-platform multiplayer.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok does not have multiplayer in any form, and people have taken to airing their grievances over the imposition by Sony to the reviews section on Steam. The main addition that it brings in this case is the ability to earn PlayStation trophies while playing on PC.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are instances where the overlay has interfered with the game’s running, whether that’s blocking people from accessing the game because linking had a server error, or with other complaints including crashes and visual bugs, which could be unrelated. At the same time, the mod itself isn’t a guaranteed success, and some report that it doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Expect there to be some back and forth between Sony’s engineers and the modding community, not just for God of War, but also for future single-player PC releases when they arrive, such as Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>In our experience, God of War Ragnarok is a fine port of a great PlayStation game. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">our hands on report</a>, Miguel said, “I was impressed by how gorgeous it looked and sounded on my desktop, and blown away by how similar the experience was when I brought it over to my Steam Deck. In many ways, the PC releases that Sony puts out of their games feel like the optimal way to experience them. God of War Ragnarok continues that trend.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date-revealed.990153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>Heihachi Mishima DLC release date, and the Resurrected King himself is arriving early next month (or late this month if you're on Pacific time).</p>
<p>Per a new trailer, Heihachi joins the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>roster on October 1st for Year 1 Pass holders, and everyone else will be able to play as him on October 4th (again, that's September 30th and October 3rd for Pacific time players).</p>
<p>Heihachi is the third DLC character to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-dlc-heihachi">be announced</a> for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>since it launched earlier this year. He joins a DLC roster that also includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-eddy-gordo-release-date">capoeira legend Eddy Gordo</a> and (fictional) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date">Polish prime minister Lidia Sobieska</a>, with one more fighter yet to be announced as part of the game's first year of DLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-dlc-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=iLAeINTR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-dlc-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=Pu7kk_mr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Heihachi joins&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster very soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As is customary for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC characters at this point, Bandai Namco has also released a gameplay trailer for Heihachi, showing off the Mishima patriarch's brutal fighting style.</p>
<p>He first goes up against none other than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-reveals-jin-kazama-in-action">Jin Kazama</a>, suggesting that the two "should try getting along" as "two men back from the dead". Sadly, that doesn't take, and it's not long before Heihachi is taking on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-kazuya-gameplay-trailer-shows-bone-crunching-combos">Kazuya Mishima</a>.</p>
<p>Kazuya demands to know how Heihachi is still alive, in response to which Heihachi expresses amusement that Kazuya "thought some measly lava could kill me". Him and the rest of the world, Heihachi.</p>
<p>As you'd probably expect, Heihachi's trailer concludes with his Rage Art, which consists of an almighty punch delivered to Kazuya while he's in Devil Form. That's got to smart.</p>

<p>Heihachi lands as part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters on October 4th (for most players). One more fighter is also set to arrive as part of this DLC pass, although we don't know who it is yet.</p>
<p><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/tekken-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9ppsm14vkclw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
