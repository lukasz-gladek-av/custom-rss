            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/derke-joins-team-vitalitys-valorant-team/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been quite the past few weeks, as many big esports teams have begun to announce all their new Valorant signings while preparing for the 2025 VCT season. Among these teams is team Vitality, which just announced one of its biggest signings, Derke.</p>



<h2 id="h-derke-joins-team-vitality">Derke Joins Team Vitality</h2>



<p>It is no secret that Derke is quite the decorated player in competitive Valorant. Back in 2023, the competitor helped Evil Geniuses win the VCT 2023: Master Tokyo event and even took the stage with Team Vitality back in July of 2024 for the EMEA Stage 2, where the team came first.</p>



<p>However, Derke competed with Sentinels in the VCT Champions this year.</p>



<p>Now, the player will be joining Team Vitality for the entirety of 2025, helping to give the team one of its best years yet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“Very excited to join this team with very amazing and promising players,” said Derke on Twitter when announcing his signing to Team Vitality. “Next year will be very exciting for everyone and especially for me as it’s the first time I’m having big changes like these and I’m considering it as a good challenge. The boys already felt very welcoming and really hungry to win so I’m very excited for the next season.”</p>



<p>The Finnish/Russian player will be a massive asset for the esports team going into 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-s-record">Team Vitality’s Record</h2>



<p>Team Vitality has struggled throughout the past few years with its Valorant competitive side. The team has yet to take home first place in an S-Tier Valorant tournament, with its last first place being back in 2022 VRL France: Revolution Stage 2. </p>



<p>However, that does not change the fact that the team continues to sign some of the best names in Valorant.</p>



<p><strong>Team Vitality’s current Valorant Roster:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Derke</li>



<li>Less</li>



<li>trexx</li>



<li>Sayf</li>



<li>Kicks</li>



<li>ceNder</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-season-one-will-start-november-14-promo-claims.1015596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the terms and conditions of the Little Caesars Black Ops 6 promo, it was suggested that the first season of Black Ops 6 will commence on November 14. It was referenced in a single line that has now been edited out to read ‘later this year’, suggesting that it was either real and written up too soon or written entirely in error.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-first-pass">The First Pass</h2>



<p>For the first couple of weeks of Black Ops 6, which will be released on Friday, players will be settling in and getting to grips with all the launch weapons, ‘Omnimovement’, and the many maps in the game. They’ll also be completing the campaign, as this time around, there were no pre-order bonuses that granted early access to the single-player portion of the game.</p>



<p>Little Caesars is running a promotion that can earn players in-game rewards, which is common enough for a new Call of Duty game. However, in the promotion’s terms and conditions (as spotted <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK_/status/1848421146317779228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by BobNetworkUK on X</a>), there <strong>was </strong>a reference suggesting the game’s first season would go live on November 14.</p>



<p>This was screencapped by Bob.</p>



<p>If you access that link again, you’ll notice that the reference to November 14 has been removed, and it now reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Please note the Battle Pass will be delivered in-game at the start of Season 1 for&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, coming later this year</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s about right, though. Typically, each new Call of Duty game has a settling-in period that is followed by the first <strong>official </strong>season, which is when the game’s first battle pass will be made ready for purchase and the rewards will start flowing. It’s also when the <strong>grind </strong>begins.</p>



<p>November 14 sounds about right – are you ready? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275996/asmongold-palestinians-racist-rant-apology-twitch-streaming-culture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Last week, top Twitch streamer Zach Hoyt, better known as Asmongold, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/467037/asmongolds-twitch-suspension-palestine-explained">went on a racist rant against Palestinians</a>, expressing apathy for the relentless military campaign against them that has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">claimed over 40,000 lives</a>, many of them children. “I don’t give a fuck,” he said. “They’re terrible people.”</p><p>Hoyt is known for his incendiary language, but reactions to this recent outburst were enough to give him pause.&nbsp;Shortly after the stream, Hoyt <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1845982422275367189">posted an apology</a>, saying, “Looking back on it, I was way too much of an asshole about the Palestine thing. My bad.” Twitch suspended his channel for 14 days, and Hoyt said that he would be stepping away from leadership duties at his media company, OTK, and its subsidiaries. In <a href="https://youtu.be/RSI-N-QHNTQ?si=sXPcvJAdxxXrd3uS">a video posted to YouTube</a>, Hoyt said streaming has had a negative impact on his personality and that over the last two years, he’s been, “slowly devolving into the most mean-spirited ... rude, nasty, callous, psychopathic version of myself.”</p><p>Hoyt’s video has unintentionally shed light on a major reason that being online can feel so miserable. It’s one of the rare instances of a person with such a huge following —&nbsp;1.8 million followers on Twitch alone —&nbsp;has acknowledged that the rise of reckless, racist, homophobic, and misogynistic behavior stems from streaming culture itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Popular creators have been relying on shock and outrage to generate views for years. In 2017, at the height of his popularity on YouTube, Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg paid a pair of individuals to hold up a sign displaying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/13/14605060/pewdiepie-disney-deal-lost-nazi-anti-semitic-imagery">a violent antisemitic phrase</a>. One year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840176/logan-paul-suicide-video-apology-aokigahara-forest">Logan Paul filmed a suicide victim in Japan</a>. More recently, these kinds of behaviors have become the rule rather than the exception. And the problem has grown with the shift to live platforms like Twitch where streamers exploit — sometimes intentionally, sometimes not — outrage farming for the attention it generates.</p><p>Jack Doherty, who originally went viral for flipping markers on YouTube, was banned from Kick earlier this month after a livestream <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/462915/kick-controversy-jack-doherty-car-crash">showed him crashing his McLaren</a> because he was texting while driving. He asked his camera operator to keep filming even as he and his passengers were pulled from the wreckage covered in blood. Adin Ross gained notoriety streaming <em>NBA 2K</em>, but he’s maintained it specifically because his streams are known for hosting <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/adin-ross-andrew-tate-white-supremacists-1234705845/">racists like Nick Fuentes and alleged rapists like Andrew Tate</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Andrew Tate, seen here after his arrest by Romanian authorities on charges related to human trafficking, was a frequent fixture on Adin Ross’ streams and videos.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>The platforms bear some responsibility in this. More attention means more eyeballs, so platform operators are incentivized to attract, retain, and appease streamers however they can, even if that sometimes means permitting unsavory behavior. Twitch, the biggest name in the space, takes an aggressive approach to content moderation, ostensibly to maintain the platform’s “brand-safe” image to advertisers. But there are always other platforms willing to pick up its outcasts.</p><p>When it launched in 2022, Kick became the “anti-Twitch,” appealing to creators disaffected by the site’s monetization and content policies. But while Kick has exploded in popularity, offering creators an alternative in a landscape dominated by Twitch, it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/technology/kick-streaming-twitch-gambling.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">become known for creators and content that would be banned anywhere else</a>. Last year, Paul “Ice Poseidon” Denino hired a sex worker and then briefly prevented her from leaving <a href="https://www.404media.co/kick-ice-poseidon-sex-worker-escort-stream/">when she discovered the encounter was being streamed</a>. Ross showed pornography on his stream and has, on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-car-livestream-ocean-1.7134204">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/adin-ross-under-fire-for-asking-fan-to-slit-brothers-throat-for-money-2076537/">occasions</a>, offered money to fans to do dangerous stunts.</p><p>Then there’s the gambling. After Twitch banned the practice, Kick — cofounded by the same people who founded casino site Stake — became the de facto home of gambling streams. It uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938853/kick-nickmercs-gambling-contract-stake">enormous multimillion-dollar contracts</a> to entice big-name creators to the site, where their audience of millions can essentially watch them develop gambling addictions in real time. Félix “xQc” Lengyel — a streamer who started his career playing in the <em>Overwatch</em> League — has become one of the most well-known gambling streamers. In 2022, he <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/streamer-xqc-admits-to-dollar2-million-in-gambling-losses-last-month-gets-told-off-by-his-dad-on-stream/">admitted he was addicted to gambling</a> after disclosing on a stream that he had lost $2 million in a single month.&nbsp;</p><p>Kick cofounder Ed Craven knows his platform attracts thrill seekers and their escalating behaviors. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/technology/kick-streaming-twitch-gambling.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">an interview with <em>The New York Times</em></a>, he said, “I think people are realizing the more controversial they are, the more shock factor involved in their content, the more viewers they get, and it can sometimes be a dangerous mix in that regard.” But while he’s said that Kick is continuously evolving its policies and the site’s terms of service prohibit the usual bad behaviors, that hasn’t stopped its streamers from <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/nmplol-disgusted-after-kick-streamer-allegedly-sexually-assaults-him-at-twitchcon-2906436/">continuing to push boundaries</a>.</p><p>And when a streamer’s actions do cross the line, what happens next? Historically, the bigger an audience a streamer has, the more reluctant a platform is to enact meaningful consequences —&nbsp;and the less leverage the platform has against them. For smaller creators, an action like a suspension can be financially significant as they rely on consistent output to maintain their partnership status or to collect donations. But a Twitch streamer like Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff, who has millions of followers and millions of dollars in subscription revenue, doesn’t have that same concern. When Kolcheff was suspended earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-twitch-ban-slur-mrbeast-drdisrespect-1851566196">after using a slur against transgender people</a>, he <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1806640207216664777">responded on social media</a> saying that he didn’t know the word that got him banned was problematic, then made another joke at the trans community’s expense.</p><p>The most serious consequence a streamer can face for their behavior is the permanent loss of their channel, but platform incentives ensure there’s always somewhere else to go. When Herschel “Guy” Beahm, better known by his persona Dr Disrespect, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch</a> for reasons that were not initially disclosed, he continued streaming, migrating his channel — and his 4 million strong audience — to YouTube. After Ross’ eighth and <a href="https://gamerant.com/adin-ross-permanent-ban-reason-twitch/">final ban from Twitch last year</a>, he went to Kick, where he continues his controversial behavior, recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/09/some-influencers-arent-leaving-florida-despite-hurricane-milton-sparking-online-criticism/">offering to pay creators to livestream Hurricane Milton</a>. For his birthday, Craven <a href="https://gamerant.com/kick-ceo-eddie-craven-adin-ross-rolls-royce-birthday/">gifted him a Rolls-Royce</a>.</p><p>Streaming and social media reward people for being their worst selves, and it’s starting to have noticeable effects. Hateful rhetoric, like the kind Hoyt used, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/technology/twitter-hate-speech.html">on the rise</a>. External political factors like the rise of anti-LGBTQ policies, political candidates, and sentiments contribute to this. Clips of streamers espousing discriminatory views get pushed on social media, creating the kind of viral moments streamers chase. With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">resurgence of Gamergate</a> and “anti-woke” reactionaries, streamers have found that appealing to — or at least not alienating — those who agree with those subjects can lead to an audience boost. Those communities are delighted to show up in force now that their opinions are no longer relegated to the fringes of the internet but validated by its biggest voices. Reactions to Hoyt’s apology across social media featured many comments stating that he said nothing wrong.</p><div><p>Top creators <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/1/17413542/burnout-mental-health-awareness-youtube-elle-mills-el-rubius-bobby-burns-pewdiepie">are burnt out</a>. MrBeast has warned aspiring creators <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxFujx1SuGYZAJNII5hKWuxmVddMeOke0y?si=KXLPR2aO7ov4AD67">not to follow in his footsteps</a>. Though he admitted to having an addiction, xQc continues his gambling streams, possibly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/business/twitch-kick-xqc.html#:~:text=kick%2Dxqc.html-,Twitch%20Star%20xQc%20Signs%20%24100%20Million%20Deal%20With%20Kick%2C%20a,relationship%20with%20its%20top%20streamers.&amp;text=Kellen%20Browning%20reports%20on%20the%20video%20game%20industry.">because of the $100 million contract he signed with Kick</a>. Even streamers who aren’t known for being assholes have to sprinkle <a href="https://x.com/itsavibe/status/1808675839568965633">over-the-top behavior into their content</a> to keep the views flowing.</p></div><p>This makes Hoyt’s apology unique, not only because it was a rare moment of sincerity — an emotion wholly antithetical to this new streaming culture — but also because a self-admitted asshole rarely engages in the kind of reflection he did. He explained that as streaming has become his entire life, it caused him to lose valuable perspective. “There have been ways that I have acted that are indefensible,” he said. “Looking back on it, it’s just disgusting.”</p><p>But the views must flow, so there’s a limit to Hoyt’s newfound perspective. On Reddit, his post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1g574c2/comment/ls8zz66/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">explaining the apology</a> contained a slur once used to describe mentally disabled people — a word that is now experiencing <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/376401/r-word-slur-return-euphemism-treadmill-cycle">a noticeable and concerning comeback</a>. His post also clarified that his apology didn’t mean he was going to totally change his behavior, only that he intends for future streams to be more positive. “Don’t worry,” he wrote. “I’ll react to a DEI=DIE gaming video first day back to stream.” The comment had over 800 upvotes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alcon said it wanted to avoid any association with Musk’s “massively amplified, highly politicized, capricious and arbitrary behavior, which sometimes veers into hate speech,” and also to not jeopardize potential brand deals with other car companies ahead of the launch of an upcoming <em>Blade Runner 2099</em> TV show on Amazon Prime. Despite denying Musk’s request to use <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> in his presentation, the lawsuit states, “He did it anyway.”</p><p>While Musk was once known primarily for his electric cars, he’s made news much more often in recent years for incendiary comments on X, formerly known as Twitter, which he purchased in 2022.

And one of those features is the addition of smoothies!</p><p>Made at any of the smoothie shops around Hyrule, Zelda can mix up some delicious drinks by combining ingredients she’s found during your travels. These smoothies—of which there are an astonishing 70—can provide you with everything from simple heart replenishment to special effects like heat and cold resistance. Below, we’ll list our favorite smoothies that we think you should keep in your flask.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After creating a smoothie for the first time, you can go to any smoothie shop and opt to pay a premium to repurchase the same drink without using the ingredients, allowing you to keep a selection of smoothies on hand even if you don’t have the necessary materials to remake them. However, this costs a <em>lot</em> of rupees, so we don’t recommend making a habit of it. Stick to using ingredients when possible.</p><p>Click on to read the best smoothies in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-recommend-id="image://4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-recommend-id="image://4e6a2f973c0c25bd0fbe43e36bb70905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Made with:</strong> Tough Mango + Golden Egg</p><p>The Golden Tough Smoothie makes use of exceedingly rare Golden Eggs to create a tasty treat that not only replenishes 20 hearts but also boosts your defense for five minutes.

                <p>The Steam Deck will not get yearly iterations a la the iPhone, according to one of its designers, though a Steam Deck 2 will likely happen at some point.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reviews.org</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275604/dont-expect-a-new-steam-deck-to-drop-each-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>) Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang said, "We’re not going to do a bump every year. There’s no reason to do that." He elaborated that he felt it was unfair to customers to offer only incremental improvements each year. He said, "...we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck."</p><p>This answer matches prior statements Valve has made. On several occasions last year, Valve employees stated that a more powerful <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-deck-2-is-still-years-away/1100-6519084/" data-ref-id="1100-6519084">Steam Deck will be years away</a>--late 2025 at the earliest. Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais explained that part of the Steam Deck brand (at least for now) is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-have-to-wait-at-least-two-years-for-a-faster-steam-deck/1100-6517933/" data-ref-id="1100-6517933">every model can play the same games</a>; Valve doesn't want to change that until Steam Deck performance gets a significant boost without losing battery life. Later in the interview, Yang did note that Valve is working on a Steam Deck successor.</p><p>The Steam Deck did get an upgrade last year in the form of the Steam Deck OLED, which improves battery life and the display quality. The Steam Deck's popularity has resulted in a variety of competitors, including the Asus ROG Ally, which got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support/1100-6525778/" data-ref-id="1100-6525778">SteamOS support in August.</a></p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was supposed to be released on November 15, but thanks to a considerable delay, it was pushed back to February 14. Then, the game’s branding was washed with a fresh dose of hot water following some design controversies tied to some merchandise, and <strong>now </strong>Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of any early access to the game.</p>



<p>It’s still a pretty highly anticipated title, but it’s proving to be quite a slog just to get hands-on with the end product.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-changes">Making Changes</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Discord server</a>, an official Q&amp;A session revealed new details about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows collector’s edition, which is a super-sized bundle originally priced at almost $300. </p>



<p>Per the Q&amp;A session, some monumental changes have been made:</p>

<li>The early access portion of the offering has been <strong>cancelled</strong>. It will now be released on February 14 alongside the base game</li>



<li>The game’s season pass has been scrapped, so this will understandably <strong>not </strong>be included with the collector’s edition as planned</li>
</ul>



<p>These changes reflect an alteration in the game’s pricing. It has gone from around $279 to $229. It was also explained by Ubisoft that further changes might be made to the collector’s edition’s aesthetic, statue, steelbook, art book, and so on.</p>



<p>These changes might be inspired by the issues Ubisoft has had thus far maintaining historical accuracy and cultural representation. Further scandals in that area could be the final nail in the coffin for this game from a PR standpoint.</p>



<p>The Gold Edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows was also planned to be released three days early and go hand-in-hand with a season pass, but given these recent comments, it’s almost guaranteed that the price of <strong>that edition </strong>will also drop, as will the digital offering and early access window.</p>

                <p>Few games have ever been in development as long as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-has-been-purchased-by-over-1-million-players/1100-6508145/" data-ref-id="1100-6508145">Star Citizen</a> has, with its 12-years-and-counting cycle. But Star Citizen's standalone spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizens-single-player-game-squadron-42-delay/1100-6444340/" data-ref-id="1100-6444340">Squadron 42</a>, comes close with 10 years since the game was announced. At this year's CitizenCon 2954, Cloud Imperium stopped short of saying that Squadron 42 will have a definite release date in 2026. But Cloud Imperium CEO Chris Roberts did say that he was "confident" it would be released in two years.</p><p>To back up his claim, Roberts presented an hour-long gameplay demo of Squadron 42, which had a few crashes along the way. But it did show off the Wing Commander-inspired gameplay and intense sci-fi action. There are also plenty of cutscenes in the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H-0x4xk2Xk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1H-0x4xk2Xk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A lot of celebrity talent has lent their voices and likenesses to the game, including Wing Commander star--and Star Wars icon--Mark Hamill, as well as Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Henry Cavill, Gillian Anderson, Mark Strong, Jack Huston, Ben Mendelsohn, and more. Cloud Imperium certainly had the budget to attract that A-list talent, since Squadron 42 and Star Citizen have raised over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$700 million in crowdfunding</a> since 2012.</p><p>Prior to CitizenCon 2954, Cloud Imperium reportedly forced its employees into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-is-forcing-employees-to-work-seven-days-a-week-report/1100-6526879/" data-ref-id="1100-6526879">a seven-day-a-week crunch-style schedule</a> to make its deadlines for the convention. Even with that extra effort, the demo had a buggy performance, and Roberts apologized for the crashes. Squadron 42 was announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squadron-42-is-now-feature-complete-after-10-years-of-development-see-new-footage-here/1100-6518577/" data-ref-id="1100-6518577">as "feature-complete" at last year's CitizenCon</a>, but clearly a lot of work remains to be done.</p><p>As for Star Citizen, Cloud Imperium's flagship title is still in alpha, with no projected release date in sight. However, Cloud Imperium did offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-now-selling-48000-bundle-that-includes-every-ship/1100-6520120/" data-ref-id="1100-6520120">a massive $48,000 bundle with every ship</a> in the game earlier this year. Hopefully someday, players will get a full game to go along with all of those ships.</p>

            <p>
It's been nearly two years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> first surfaced, immediately dazzling the world with his distinctive underwater exploration/sushi restaurant management charms, but developer Mintrocket isn't done yet; the studio has now confirmed a story expansion is on the way, and perhaps even spin-off games for each of Dave's pals.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Dave the Diver creator and director Jaeho Hwang, who shared the news with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dave-the-divers-creator-wants-to-create-a-dave-cinematic-universe-of-games/">VGC</a> during Singapore's recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Asia. "I want to expand Dave the Diver IP itself," he explained of the studio's future plans. "I think that's every director's dream, since we have a relatable character." Hwang (who also serves as Mintrocket's CEO) added while the base game "didn't go really deep into the personal stories in Dave the Diver, because we wanted to keep the game very casual", he wants to start filling in some of those blanks.
</p>
<p>
It seems at least some of that will happen in "the story DLC [Mintrocket is] working on right now", but Hwang said he also wants to make "separate games about each character to show how they met, what they did before coming to the Blue Hole." He noted there's some precedent for this already, albeit in reverse, given Dave the Diver character Cobra's backstory is technically told in Evil Factory, one of Hwang's earlier games.

<p>
Hwang added spin-offs focussing on different characters could give the studio a chance to explore new genres within the Dave the Diver universe, and maybe visit Dave the Diver at a time in his life he had a different profession. "He's always been a diver," he continued, "so we really haven't thought about how we should move with Dave... I really want to show how he grew up, and how he became a diver, and how he ended up coming to the Blue Hole."
</p><p>
To date, Dave the Diver - which has sold over 4m copies since launching last year - has received three bits of post-launch DLC: the Digital Extra expansion feature various cosmetics, plus a digital art book and soundtrack, as well as a free Dredge collaboration and another focused on Godzilla. Hawng offered no hint as to when Mintrocket might be done with Dave the Diver's story DLC, but it should provide the perfect excuse to revise an already stellar game.
</p>
<p>
"Wholesome, harmonious and completely unwilling to settle," is Eurogamer described Dave the Diver in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">five star review</a>, "this is one of the most generous games in years."

		<p>Bandai Namco and Rebel Wolves have announced a publishing partnership agreement today, with Bandai Namco set to publish Rebel Wolves’ first game. That game is going to be a AAA action RPG called Dawnwalker, and it is supposed to be start of a new gaming saga. Rebel Wolves was founded in 2022 by the game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. He has been joined by other CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves’ Tomasz Tinc said about the agreement, <em>“Rebel Wolves is a new studio built upon solid foundations: a combination of experience and fresh energy. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, a company known for its dedication to the role-playing genre and willingness to engage with new IPs, is a perfect match for our Wolfpack. Not only does it share our values, but also its track record in publishing narrative-driven RPGs speaks for itself. We’re looking forward to working with them to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to gamers worldwide.”</em></p>


<p>Alberto Gonzalez Lorca VP for Business Development at Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, said, <em>“This is another key milestone in our content development strategy for the Western market. By combining our strengths, we will deliver this first game of the studio to a worldwide audience. We’re excited with the universe being created by Rebel Wolves thanks to their extremely talented team of developers, resulting in a great addition to our portfolio.”</em></p>
<p>Not much is known about Dawnwalker, except that it will be set in Medieval Europe, will be an action RPG and will lean into dark fantasy. One of the things <a href="https://rebel-wolves.com/#section-services">Rebel Wolves has written on its website</a> about Dawnwalker is that it wants to give player’s more agency within games. The quote says, <em>“Our goal is to give you plenty of ways to solve a problem and then let you have a go at it. There will be no right or wrong way to play the game – it’ll be up to you to decide what is your way.”</em></p>

<p>There is currently no release date for Dawnwalker, though the confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>In this Sparking Zero Bonus Battle, players have to train with Master Roshi as Kid Goku, and the mission can only be won by proving your training. The way to do this is by paying attention to Master Roshi’s dialogues, and he will mention which super or ultimate attack players must use as Kid Goku to defeat Roshi and win this battle. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-welcome-to-frieza-force">Welcome to Frieza Force!</h2>



<p>Players have to defeat every character with Nappa to win this Bonus Battle in Sparking Zero, and the lineup includes Frieza Force Soldier, Cui, Dodoria, Zarbon and Frieza himself. However, players aren’t allowed to use their Ultimate Attack against Frieza. If you use your Ultimate, Frieza will get annoyed and destroy the planet. If you don’t use your ultimate, Frieza will acknowledge your strength and recruit you to the Frieza Force.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-body-change-turns-the-tables">Body Change Turns the Tables!</h2>



<p>In this Sparking ZeroBnus Battle, players start off as a tired Ginyu, who Frieza has challenged. You start at a very low health, and the only way to win is by performing Ginyu’s Ultimate Move, Body Change.&nbsp;To complete this mission quickly, players should use SP Fighting Pose 5, which can be performed by Pressing R2/RT + Up Arrow on the D-pad. This will put you in Sparking! More, allowing you to use your Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Frieza can one-shot you during this period, so remember to block. Once you have used the Body Change, defeat Frieza in Ginyu’s body as Ginyu in Frieza’s body to complete this mission.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-late-onset-madness">Late-Onset Madness</h2>



<p>In this Bonus Battle, you must defeat Goku as Vegeta without using any Ki, only punches and kicks. That means no Super or Ultimate attacks, transformations, or going into Sparking! Mode. You will only have to defeat Goku with the help of combos only.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-a-battle-of-speed-defeat-beerus">A Battle of Speed! Defeat Beerus!</h2>



<p>In this Sparking Zero Bonus Battle, Vegeta goes over to Beerus to ask for training. Beerus says he will help but will finish Vegeta off if he gets bored. He is not joking about the boring part; if he gets bored, he will finish off Vegeta in a second. &nbsp;To keep Beerus entertained, you need to inflict a lot of damage. Every 30 seconds, players will have to take off a significant chunk of Beerus’ health to keep them from getting bored. If he gets bored, he will one-shot you with his ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, how do you defeat him? Players will need to inflict steady damage on Beerus; literally, don’t give him time to breathe. As base Vegeta, players should use as many combos as possible until they can enter Sparking Mode and then hit Beerus with a Final Flash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, once you have excess Skill Stocks, transform to Super Saiyan Vegeta and start pummelling Beerus again. However, during the battle, Beerus also keeps healing himself and adds health bars. When you have the window, enter Sparking Mode again, inflict Sparking Combos until the last bit of Ki is left and then use the Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transformations add buffs to your damage, so players should consider transforming into Super Saiyan God Vegeta and keep up the combos. However, you must enter Sparking Mode again, inflict as much damage as possible, and then use the Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Dragon Dash is a helpful movement mechanic for this fight, as Beerus will be evasive, and this move will help you quickly cover a lot of distance. To perform the Super Dragon Dash, press and hold R2/RT and double tap X/A. This will make Vegeta enter a high-speed rush and land directly at the back of Beerus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another thing you should keep in mind is the dialogue; if Beerus says he is getting bored, you are getting sloppy, and you need to increase the speed at which you are inflicting damage. If he acknowledges Vegeta’s strength, you are on the right track. This is a difficult battle and might require a couple of retries.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-god-vs-god">God vs. God</h2>



<p>In this Bonus Battle, Beerus and Whis travel with Goku and Vegeta to fight Black and Zamasu. Players must defeat Zamasu and Black to win this battle using only Vegeta and Goku. You can let Beerus join in, but he can’t inflict too much damage, or you will lose the battle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beerus can’t join in because Whis tells him at the start of the mission that a God of Destruction can’t meddle with time, and the Saiyans will have to handle it themselves. A great way to go about it is to use Goku and Vegeta to the limit, defeating Black and bringing Zamasu’s health to the last bar or defeating him altogether. If you switch to Beerus at the last health bar, you can still defeat Zamasu and win the battle; however, using Beerus to inflict more damage than that will lead to losing the fight.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-in-search-of-powerful-rivals-conclusion-nbsp">In Search of Powerful Rivals: Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are two endings to this Sparking Zero Bonus Battle. In the first ending, players need to survive long enough in front of Beerus, and he will switch out with Goku, who will then fight Cell in his base form. However, if you can defeat Beerus quickly, a new ending will be triggered, where Goku will come and battle Cell in his Mastered Ultra Instinct form.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40000-secret-level-animation-is-a-sequel-to-space-marine-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Amazon and Games Workshop have revealed fresh details about their Secret Level Warhammer 40,000 episode, confirming it’s a sequel to the recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/secret-level">Secret Level</a> is an animated anthology series made up of 15 independent episodes, each based on a game. It’s created by some of the people behind Netflix’s animated anthology series <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/love-death-and-robots">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a>, and is set to launch on Prime Video on December 10.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2iuskcvl/secret-level-warhammer-animation-news-out-of-new-york-comic-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop pointed out that executive producer and supervising director Dave Wilson was responsible for one of the first ever Warhammer animations, the iconic opening to the original <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a> real-time strategy game. That <a href="https://youtu.be/_oqr06cHAGw?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening cinematic</a>, now 20 years old, is hugely popular among Warhammer 40,000 fans and is often held up as one of the best Warhammer 40,000 animations ever created.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Perhaps of most interest is the Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode’s link to Saber Interactive’s record-breaking Space Marine 2. First up, Games Workshop confirmed actor Clive Standen’s return as Ultramarines lieutenant Titus, the protagonist of the game.</p><p>“Players of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will have already clocked the iconic figure of Lieutenant Titus in the initial teaser trailer released back in August,” Games Workshop said. “Today it has just been confirmed that the indomitable Clive Standen is reprising his leading role as the voice of Titus in this new animation.”</p><p>Games Workshop then confirmed this Secret Level animation is “a sequel to Space Marine 2,” even going as far as teasing that it follows on directly from the events of the game’s campaign.</p><p>“Yes, that’s Titus and what’s that fancy laurel on his helmet?” Games Workshop said. “If you’ve completed the game, then you already know! This animation follows the conclusion of the video game like a... secret level.”</p><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Space Marine 2 spoilers follow.</em></p><p>So, what could this mean? Space Marine 2 ends with Titus vindicated having joined forces with Ultramarines Chapter Master Marneus Calgar to defeat the forces of Chaos. Calgar awards Titus with a new helmet adorned with the Imperial Laurel before calling upon him to take on a mysterious mission. Presumably that’s where Secret Level picks up. (You can check out the ending of Space Marine 2 in the video below.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Secret Level hits Prime Video on December 10 and includes episodes based on everything from Sony's Concord to Epic's Unreal. The Warhammer 40,000 episode is in the first salvo alongside seven others. The rest of the series drops a week later on December 17.</p><p>As for a continuation of the Space Marine 2 story in video game form, Saber has remained coy on the possibility of campaign DLC, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">it’s admitted it already has ideas floating around for the seemingly inevitable Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 15 Tips For Playing COD: Black Ops 6 As An Older Gamer</p>
      </div>
<p>The riot shield can be particularly frustrating to run up against in matches due to its ability to deflect incoming fire, prompting enemies to have to change their strategy to take down the shield-users. Skilled players who successfully utilize the riot shield can sway the flow of any given match, especially so in certain modes like Hardpoint and Domination. Fans of the riot shield, meanwhile, say it brings a new level of strategy and meta-game to the mix.</p><p>In any event, some amongst the Call of Duty fanbase have called for its removal for years, but it remains to be seen why Activision isn't including it in Black Ops 6. The developer did not provide any commentary around why the riot shield is being left out this time around.</p><p>It's always possible that Black Ops 6 could bring the riot shield to the game through an update in the future, as numerous more weapons, attachments, and field upgrades are expected to come to the game over the course of its seasons.</p><p>Black Ops 6 will have a shield of sorts at launch, as the game allows players to use players as a "meat shield" similar to the long-running feature in the Gears of War games. If a player can successfully sneak up behind an enemy, they can choose to use them as a body shield for a period of time, or execute them immediately.</p><p>While Black Ops 6 is dropping the riot shield, it's bringing back the Last Stand perk--sort of. It's returning in the form of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-brings-back-last-stand-but-not-how-youd-expect/1100-6527267/" data-ref-id="1100-6527267">field upgrade called Morphine Injector</a>, and it's likely to spark some debate of its own.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and it will also be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">available through Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</a>.

        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The story is set in an alternate Japan, different from the real world, where fiction is neglected and otaku are persecuted.</p><p>MOE is a mysterious substance generated on the upper layer of the Mohorovicic discontinuity, between the Earth’s crust and mantle. It has long influenced human civilization by activating the brain’s capacity for fiction.</p><p>With fiction suppressed, the movement of the Earth’s crust triggered a mass emission of MOE, leading to the outbreak of the “Personification Phenomenon” (P.P.) throughout Japan.</p><p>P.P. is a phenomenon in which a person’s desires transform any object into a character using MOE as the medium.</p><p>Dr. Tadokoro, who was among the first to discover the existence of MOE and holds the key to resolving P.P., suddenly goes missing.</p><p>Onodera, a deep-sea submarine pilot transformed into a female character, and Associate Professor Yukinaga, with the help of the similarly transformed submarine Wadatsumi, embark on a journey across the chaos-stricken Japanese islands in pursuit of Dr. Tadokoro.</p><p><strong>Artwork</strong></p><p><em>—France’s State-of-the-Art Deep-Sea Submarine Kermadec, Transformed into a Girl</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Japan-Sinks-Game_2024_10-21-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Deep-Sea Submarine Wadatsumi, Transformed into a Girl—Constructed in 1980 and Now 50 Years Old</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Japan-Sinks-Game_2024_10-21-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Japan-Sinks-Game_2024_10-21-24_003.jpg"></a></figure></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Silent Hill 2 has gotten its first big post-launch update. It includes technical improvements and bug fixes across PC and PS5.</p><p>On PS5, the patch fixes a set of "rare" crashes, including in streaming and AI modes. It also repairs an issue with switching in-game motion blur on and off.</p><p>Most notably for PC, the update improves Steam Deck optimization. Players using DLSS can now enable frame generation and Nvidia Reflex. The patch adds support for AMD FSR 3.1.1. and the ability to enable AMD Fluid Motion Frames when using FSR 3.1. for supersampling. Graphics settings should now be saved locally.</p><p>Most of the gameplay fixes are shared across versions. For example, James' animations for switching weapons while aiming have improved. An issue where information about New Game + was displayed in the incorrect language has also been fixed.</p><p>If you've wrapped up Silent Hill 2 already, you may want to read up on how to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-endings-how-to-unlock-all-endings-including-new-ones/2900-5831/" data-ref-id="2900-5831">the remake's new endings</a>.
