<p>Not all that detailed, eh? Hey ho, at least the additions sound interesting enough.</p>
<p>We had a good time with Fitness Boxing 3 when it punched its way onto Switch last year. While the music really got on our nerves, we stated that it "brings some much-needed variety to what could have been another by-the-numbers release with new songs and not much else" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/fitness-boxing-3-your-personal-trainer">our 7/10 review</a>.</p>

			<p>Studio Wildcard's latest ARK: Survival Ascended expansion, Lost Colony, is now out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S players, as the latest expansion closes the gap between the stories of the previous Extinction expansion and the upcoming ARK 2, while adding a host of new creatures, seven new biomes, and more.</p>



<p>Lost Colony takes players to Arat Prime, where humanity made its final stand. You'll begin your journey in the Necrocene, a post-cataclysmic era that has plunged the entire southern pole of the Earth into darkness. It's here, beneath the snow, the ice, and under the shroud of night, where the Lost Colony continues to survive below its energy shields. </p>



<p>Energy shields that are powered by radioactive Red Element, which is also the source of what's keeping the Earth a broken planet. Which is how the Lost King wants to keep, to maintain his rule. It's then your choice to go the way of the lost king and succumb to his tyranny, or try to oppose him and hold on to your humanity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARK: Lost Colony 'Ossidon' Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtcKl-NNnLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The release of this expansion rounds out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3720100/ARK_Lost_Colony_Expansion_Pass/">Lost Colony expansion pass</a> that Studio Wildcard announced and kicked off earlier this year, which was also when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/">received a major graphical update across consoles and PC</a>, including improvements that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">took advantage of PlayStation's PSSR and PS5 Pro</a>.</p>



<p>Across the seven new biomes introduced, you'll experience the overwhelming and oppressive metropolis of the Lost King's domain, the arctic perimeter of the Tundra, the bioluminescent flowers and fauna of the Twilight Forest that's far more dangerous than it looks, the eerie Dark Forest that leads to even more dangers beyond what lurks in its woods. </p>



<p>There's also the Caldera, a volcanic crater with a massive sacred ring dedicated to the Lost King, hot springs which you'll find across the map in different concentrations, and aberrant crash sites where you'll have to avoid toxic sludge. So, cheery places all in all.</p>



<p>Across these new biomes you'll find 13 new creatures, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Veilwyn</li>



<li>Solwyn</li>



<li>Malwyn</li>



<li>Ossidon</li>



<li>Gloon</li>



<li>Desmodus</li>



<li>Cryolophosaurus</li>



<li>Gigadesmodus</li>



<li>Aureliax</li>



<li>Thralls</li>



<li>Gargoyles</li>



<li>Neophytes</li>



<li>Revenants</li>
</ul>



<p>It's a fairly sizable expansion for ARK players to dig into while they wait for ARK 2, which doesn't seem to be arriving anytime soon. In fact, Studio Wildcard <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">confirmed today</a> that it won't be arriving until 2028, with an expansion in 2027 giving players their first taste of what the sequel will be like.</p>

<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/reap-what-you-sow-a-first-look-at-the-savage-world-of-no-law</link>
            <guid>1387558</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards included a reveal trailer for NO LAW, a cyberpunk first-person shooter from developer Neon Giant and publisher Krafton that’s coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The trailer gave us a first look at the sleazy, lawless city of Port Desire and ended on a line that hints at the game’s tone: “Reap what you sow.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/20251119004339-1-1765306650974.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Grey Harker, a seasoned military veteran who barely survived his last deployment. So he decided to leave war behind to lead a life of peace and gardening, but of course, that peaceful life wasn’t in the cards. Trouble came knocking on his door (or more like bulldozing through it), and now it’s time for some payback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trouble isn’t exactly rare in Port Desire. As the trailer says, it’s a city with no laws and no oversight. It’s located on the coast where the borders of three nations meet, leading to a melting pot of both people and environments. There are seedy areas soaked in neon, tall buildings that stretch into the smog-filled sky, as well as lush areas where the jungle has started encroaching on the city. And you’ll see all of it as you travel across the dense open-world city.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/20251119004039-1-1765306575582.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mayors have used violence and intimidation to establish a kind of order, but it’s tenuous at best. Everyone is out for themselves, justice is self-defined, and you’re seemingly always one step away from crossing the wrong person. In this den of danger and vice, Grey’s decisions are up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The open-ended story of NO LAW evolves depending on the decisions you make. Will you help and protect those who need it? Or will you take what you want when you want it, whoever gets in your way be damned? These decisions have consequences, and each decision and consequence compound on each other to make each playthrough different. After all, “reap what you sow” doesn’t just apply to the people who’ve wronged Grey. It also applies to you, the player. This is the kind of story where it won’t be possible to see every path and outcome in one playthrough, and your relationships will be shaped by your choices.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/rooftop-infiltration-1765392744132.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Grey’s morality isn’t the only thing you’ll have control over. It’ll also be up to you how to approach combat, with several tools at your disposal. Having been in the military, Grey has training in gunplay, stealth, and hacking, but you’ll be the one to decide if he should specialize in one of these paths or be a jack-of-all-trades. He can stick to the shadows and strategically eliminate foes, use devices and hacking to outsmart them, or say to hell with all that and just rush in guns blazing, driven purely by rage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer shows some of that in action, including sneaking through vents to get the drop on enemies from above, using a device to map a room, and facing a giant mech in a 1-on-1 shootout in the street using explosives in the environment. You can also see in the trailer that environments are built with verticality in mind, providing ample opportunity for both catching enemies unawares and violently kicking them off elevated surfaces to their deaths.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/impact-screenshots-meleekick4-1765306650974.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first look at NO LAW, but there are sure to be many more details revealed in the future.

            <guid>1387555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch port of 1–4-player survival game Oppidum is officially out, completing its list of platforms after it came to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oppidum was created by Spanish indie developer EP Games with a team so small it only has one programmer, though you wouldn’t know it from the scope of the game. It has more than 40 hours of story content and a ton of features. It takes place on the once beautiful and magical island of Insule, but now corruption has spread across it and its creatures. And you're the hero who comes to break the curse that looms over the island.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll establish a camp that’s your safe space, then explore the island’s woods, swamps, and caves to try to locate the source of the corruption. These areas are full of creatures you’ll need to deal with, some of which are still touched by the magic that imbues the island.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is real-time and you’ll often face groups of enemies, so you need to pay attention to the skills of each to figure out which ones to take out first. For example, one enemy might charge you with its shield raised and seem like the most immediate threat. But it could be protecting a nearby healer, so you’ll need to avoid the aggressive attacker and take out the healer first.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-illi-1765998641262.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies will drop resources, and you can gather others by chopping down trees, taking a pickaxe to rocks, or opening treasure chests (some of which are locked until you clear the surrounding area of enemies). You’ll notice that after chopping down a tree, a glowing silhouette of it will remain. That means it will eventually regrow in that same spot, powered by the energy of the island. With the materials you gather, you can construct buildings, craft tools, upgrade your weapons, plant and tend crops, take care of animals, and cook meals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you venture across the island, you’ll meet and build relationships with its inhabitants. They’ll have new quests for you, and as you help them, they’ll help you in return. They’ll move the story forward and inform you about local customs and lore, deepening your connection to the world around you. And completing their quests can score you rewards like increased health and blueprints to improve your camp and equipment, so it’s worth helping everyone you find. As your gear improves, you’ll be able to tackle new areas, where you’ll find new residents to help, new mysteries to solve, and new information to uncover.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-oppidum-sunset-01-1765998691388.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing objectives can also open up unexpected new possibilities. For example, when you defeat a boss, it’ll unlock its Altars, where you can make offerings to get new upgrades. That includes things like expanding your inventory, increasing your health, increasing how many of one item can be included in a stack, and more. This gameplay loop guarantees that through Oppidum’s 40+ hours of content, there’s always something new to discover and new goals to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can do all of this solo or with up to three other players at the same time. There’s cross-play between all platforms, with options for shared or private playthroughs. A shared game allows everyone to invite new people, nobody can be kicked out, all players can connect at any time (meaning you don’t need a particular person to be online in order to play), and if someone leaves the realm, their slot can’t be used by someone else. A private game is created by one person, and only they have the power to invite or kick out other players. It’s also only possible to join the game while the creator is online, but if someone leaves the realm or is kicked, they can be replaced by another player.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-sights-coloredforest-1765998802952.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The experience can also be fully customized, including difficulty level and gameplay options. Difficulty can be altered with multiple different presets to tailor it to exactly what you’re looking for. If you just want stress-free gameplay where you gather resources and build up your camp without facing any real danger, you can turn on the Relaxed option, which makes it impossible for you to die. On the other end of the spectrum, if you’re looking for more of a challenge, you can activate Hardcore mode, which makes enemies much tougher and survival mechanics harsher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to get into more nitty gritty gameplay options, you can do that too. You can change things like enemies’ aggro range and how long an in-game day lasts. And there are accessibility options like disabling the need to hold buttons, adjusting durability settings for your tools and gear (which includes turning off the durability system altogether), simplifying fishing, and several more. The breadth of options earned Oppidum the Best Accessibility award at Spain’s Iris Games Awards, so needless to say it’s one of the game’s strongest features.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-new-update1-2-0-1765998769515.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch launch of Oppidum also includes the recently released Patch 1.2.0, which added a bunch of new features and content. The headlining additions are two new minigames. Beach Pong is what it sounds like, and you can play against a friend or bennies, the island’s native creatures. In Battle Arena, you can earn rewards for fighting off waves of enemies. You can play in co-op with up to four players, or compete against each other in PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch also added a new cue to let you know the right time to parry an enemy, a “snap to grid” option during building construction, a new pause feature, and lots more.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Dispatch feels like the kind of game that must have always been headed for success, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-may-get-season-2-thanks-to-super-response-from-players/1100-6536110/" data-ref-id="1100-6536110">sold a million copies in just 10 days</a>, and while it missed most of the awards season, it still landed on several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">best-of lists for the year.</a> That impression hides a much rougher reality. Dispatch took years longer than expected, nearly collapsed more than once, and only made it out because the team managed to survive long enough to finish it.</p><p>"We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit," writer and co-founder Pierre Shorette says in an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, explaining why Dispatch Season 1 took so long to make. The episodic superhero workplace comedy spent close to seven years in development. The time spent wasn't about endlessly refining a hit, but about dealing with lost funding, shifting plans, and simple survival. The upside is that the groundwork is now done, meaning a potential Season 2 would not need anything close to the same amount of time.</p><p>Game director Nick Herman is blunt about how close Dispatch came to ending. "We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of … financial things," he says. Shorette places that moment in the context of the wider industry collapse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBXNczRvheI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vBXNczRvheI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"The industry was collapsing … We were right there," he said, adding that without contract work paying the bills, "we would have died three years ago." For years, the project mostly met rejection. “You have basically everyone tell you it's a bad idea for seven f---ing years," Shorette added, while Herman recalls being told, "This is dumb, don't do it."</p><p>Dispatch was also not always the game players recognize now. It began life as a live-action interactive TV project before COVID shut that version down. Early drafts were darker and more limited, focused on a single hero rather than a full team. Over time, the game evolved into a lighter and broader experience, shifting toward the dispatch system and the group of misfit superheroes that define it today. Even Robert, the main protagonist, wasn't voiced by Aaron Paul--actor Rahul Kohli was in line to take the role. For his part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saros/">Kohli stars in Saros</a>, which is scheduled to launch next April.</p><p>Now that Dispatch is out and doing well, the pressure has changed as Shorette compares it to a musician following up a debut album. "You have your whole life to write your first album and eight months to write your second." But after taking an absurdly long time to launch one season, Dispatch is no longer starting from nothing--and that makes a much faster follow-up possible.</p><p>Dispatch is out now on PS5 and PC. It launches January 28 for Switch and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>It has been a big week for Larian Studios, which just announced its upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> to tons of fervor. Unfortunately, a lot of the week since the announcement has consisted of members of the studio, including its CEO Swen Vincke, fighting online about the team's current attitude towards AI tools in games development following an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Now, after a week of backlash, Larian is hoping to clear some of the air around Divinity and its use of AI. In a statement shared on Twitter, Vincke writes, "It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.<br>Larian’s DNA is agency.

(@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Vincke continues, "Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possible make."</p><p>To that end, Vincke states that it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies," but also claims that any aspect of the team's evolving processes that fails to "align with who we are" can and will be changed.</p><p>To clarify matters even more, and likely to take a bit of heat of off Vincke himself, Larian will be holding an AMA after the holidays. Representative of other departments at the studio will be present to field questions "about Divinity and our dev process directly." A date has yet to be announced, but will be shared in the new year.</p><p>In case you might've missed it, Vincke shared that Larian was openly embracing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">using generative AI tools</a> for its development processes on Divinity. Though he stated that no AI work would be in thh game itself ("Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," Vincke told Bloomberg), Larian devs are, per his comments, using AI to insert placeholder text and generate concept art for the heavily anticipated RPG.</p><p>In response to the news that generative AI is being used on Divinity, Larian has come under fire from fans and other developers online. In response to the backlash, Vincke initially stated, "Holy f**k guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," and shared that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking.</p><p>Vincke, and Larian's, position on AI is hardly a surprise. Earlier this year, similar comments were made in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">interview with GameSpot</a> where Vincke claimed that the studio was using machine-learning tools to automate "tasks nobody wants to do."</p>

              <p>Bethesda Game Studios may have a reputation for putting out bug-ridden games with barely functioning UIs and then leaving it all for modders to fix, but it generally does this with stunningly wonderful games in which tolerating the jank is more than worthwhile. <em>Starfield</em>, however, is the studio’s first big first-party miss since, wow, 2006’s <i>IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition</i>. What’s more striking is that the space-faring epic has, since its September 6, 2023 release, put out a single desultory expansion pack, and that was well over a year ago now. New rumors of a rejuvenated version to accompany the game’s arrival on PS5 next year do little to squash the sense that the disappointing game has become a low priority for its creators.</p> <p><em>Starfield</em> released to widespread disappointment <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351">just over two years ago</a>, followed by the most peculiarly barren post-launch period of any Bethesda game in recent memory. After a year of doldrums, the reveal of that first expansion—<em>Shattered Space—</em>looked so promising. <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323">At an early showing during Gamescom</a>, the horror vibes of the new content appeared compelling, and it felt like this could be the game’s new beginning. But instead <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-metacritic-steam-reviews-long-1851664605">the DLC was absolutely slated by reviewers</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-steam-reviews-negative-1851672655">players</a>, only further cementing the game’s reputation as a dud.</p>

 <p>Of course, because this is Bethesda, people still held out hope. While&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> was developed by a different internal team (Zenimax Online Studios), that game had the most abysmal beta and launched in 2014 in a pretty crappy state, but vast amounts of work were put in to turn it around, and it’s now a beloved MMO that still thrives a decade later. Surely, some might have reasonably thought, the same kind of effort would be put into <em>Starfield</em>, bringing about the same reversal of fortune? Surely we could expect to see a trickle of new quests, plots, and incremental improvements until it was panel-beaten into a game to place alongside <em>Skyrim</em> and&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3</em>? Yet since <em>Shattered Space</em>‘s arrival last year, we’ve had diddly-squat.</p>

  <p>The whole of 2025 has passed without not just any new content for the game, but not even the announcement of anything to come. Instead (apart from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zknfAghd-s">a video promise</a> that an unspecified new expansion was in the works), all we’ve heard are <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">rumors that the game is being prepared for a 2026 PlayStation 5 release</a> following Microsoft’s decision to abandon console exclusivity, but without any reason provided as to why PS5 players should want it any more than anyone else. Now, word is out that the PlayStation release will coincide with a “2.0” version of <em>Starfield</em> that will also come to Xbox and PC. But even this might need to be met with muted hope.</p>

 <p>Via <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/starfield-improvements-were-showcased-in-a-closed-door-event-for-version-2-0-rumour"><em>Gaming Bolt</em></a>, leaks have appeared of the revamped version of the game, shown to various influencers and the like in a closed-door showcase. Fan-run X account Starfield News <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldNews/status/2001248212104175785">posted</a> to say the event recently took place, with the claim that it was “making those who attended very excited for the future of the game.” However, YouTuber Luke Stephens posted to X to say he’d spoken to a number of people who attended, and that people should “temper expectations.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've had a few people reach out who claim to have either been present at the event or helped put it on. They are consistent in the following ways:</p> <p>Temper expectations. Things are being improved but from what I'm hearing this probably isn't a Cyberpunk 2.0 scale update. <a href="https://t.co/fjHpMCSadC">https://t.co/fjHpMCSadC</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427067540509080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Things are being improved,” Stephens says, “but from what I’m hearing this probably isn’t a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>2.0 scale update.” That’s a reference to the way CD Projekt entirely overhauled the disastrously poor launch version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to make it one of the best-loved RPGs of all time, and Bethesda can’t really fall short of that if they want to save things.</p>

 <p>Bethesda’s complete silent about all of this, with even the PS5 version’s existence never officially announced, speaks volumes about how little interest there must be in giving players a reason to get excited. That’s on top of the failure to put out any new content in a year. In fact, <em>Starfield</em> is barely getting patched these days, with only two updates in the whole of 2025, both just adding stability fixes, one in May and then the slightest update imaginable in July. The latter was accompanied with the missive, “Looking ahead, we’re continuing work on future updates and will share more about the exciting things we have planned for <em>Starfield</em> in the coming months.”</p>

 <p>Spoiler: they didn’t.</p> <p>We have no official confirmation of this closed-door presentation of a&nbsp;<em>Starfield 2.0</em>, and have asked Bethesda if it can say whether this took place—we’ll update should we get a reply. We’ve also asked about why there’s been so little information and no new content throughout 2025.</p> <p>But even if a dramatically improved revamp appears at some point in 2026 (and <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427071151804565">Luke Stephens suggests</a> it could come significantly later in the year than people have hoped), might it already be too late?&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s dismal launch was not because the game itself was inherently bad, but because it ran so atrociously, with console versions so poor that it was withdrawn from sale by Sony itself. People still wanted to get at the game that was being obscured by the huge technical issues. A year and a half later, the game was finally in a state where it could run properly on console, at which point it was embraced and adored.</p> <p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>‘s shortcomings</a> aren’t a result of technical issues (although those are present, with rumors that the loading screens are to be improved in the supposed 2.0 version), but rather the way its breadth came at the cost of depth, a vastness that doesn’t hold together as a coherent whole, meaning the trademark Bethesda wonkiness becomes far more of an issue. It’s hard to see how this can be rescued without a wealth of cohesive new content, and new content appears to be the very last thing this game is getting. That the whole of 2025 could have gone by without a single significant addition speaks incredibly poorly of Bethesda’s interest in those who bought the game and maintained hope.</p>

 <p>I get that. I can only imagine how awful it is to have spent so many years putting in so much love and effort building something so vast and intricate, only for it not to pull together in a satisfactory way. I wouldn’t want to keep having to plug away at it either, and would be far more interested to move on to <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120"><em>Fallout V</em></a>. It’s OK to release a game and then move on. But if that’s what’s happening, you can’t be telling your dedicated fanbase about “the exciting things” that are coming up, before just disappearing into a hole.</p> <p>Perhaps 2026 will reveal a&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em> that’s worth reinstalling, and finally I’ll be able to click with a game I’ve failed to connect with after three attempts. I really hope so. But it remains astonishing that 2025 saw nothing at all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Days after his comments on AI ignited a firestorm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">Larian Studios cofounder Swen Vincke</a> has elaborated on the RPG maker’s current philosophy on the controversial technology, with plans for an AMA next year to address fan concerns in more detail.</p> <p>“Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make,” he posted <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">on X on Thursday</a>. “In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</p> <p>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering…</p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new statement comes days after Larian began facing a heated backlash over the studio’s experimentation with generative AI. Vincke <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> the company was using it for some placeholder text, meeting presentations, and concept art references. He was adamant that it was not being used to undercut human creativity and would not appear in finished games like Larian’s recently revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">RPG sequel <em>Divinity</em></a>.</p>

 <p>But many fans <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934">were disappointed, and some even outraged</a>, citing ethical concerns around how AI relies on copying existing artists’ work and worries about Larian’s critically acclaimed output becoming marred by the introduction, even if only a little bit, of AI slop into the development pipeline.</p>   <p>“Holy fuck guys we’re not ‘pushing hard’ for or replacing concept artists with AI,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">r</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">esponded Vincke</a> at the time on X. “We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.”</p> <p>The controversy surrounding the studio’s stance on AI didn’t subside, however. Vincke later updated his social media profile signaling that he was listening to the feedback and planning a new response. While the CEO’s latest statement doesn’t walk back any of his prior commitments to explore how AI could potentially benefit Larian’s design process, he’s promised further context about his thoughts on AI and exactly how the studio is using it in a January AMA on Reddit.</p> <p>Here’s Vincke’s full statement:</p> <blockquote><p>It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</p> <p>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</p> <p>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</p> <p>To give you more insight, we’ll do an AMA featuring our different departments after the holiday break, in which you’ll get the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly.</p> <p>We’ll announce the date in the new year. In the meantime, I wish you all happy holidays!</p></blockquote> <p><em>Update 12/18/2025, 2:10 p.m. ET: Added more context.</em></p>

                <p>The new Apple AirPods Pro 3 launched earlier this year, but the wireless earbuds are already seeing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a limited-time price cut at Amazon</a>, where you can snag a pair for $199. That's 20% off its normal $249 price tag and one of the lowest prices we've seen so far. The AirPods Pro 3 build upon the premium sound quality and feature set of previous models, offering better active noise cancelation (ANC), a longer battery life, and new functionality like auto-translation. If you're looking for a last-minute holiday gift or are looking to treat yourself to an upgrade, this is a great opportunity to pick them up.</p><div title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5295" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Apple AirPods Pro 3</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$199 (was $249)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>As mentioned above, the AirPods 3 sport several upgrades over the previous models, including improved ANC.

The earbuds are also lightweight and come with five pairs of silicone ear tips. Battery life lasts up to eight hours on a full charge with ANC activated, and they come with a charging case that quickly recharges the battery.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you don't need super high-quality earbuds, you can get a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods 4 for $100</a>.

              <p><em>The Outfoxies</em> arrives on consoles 30 years later. Tencent invests in its own version of <em>Ready or Not</em>. And could we finally get a <em>Kingdom Three Crowns</em>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. All I can think about right now is how there’s a perfect <em>Simpsons</em> screenshot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/backpagepod.bsky.social/post/3ma6eg5h26c2a">for every major game</a> released in 2025. And no one had to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danarndtwrites.bsky.social/post/3mabjnlygj22d">use AI to make them</a>.</p>    <p>Activision <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001351763375325384%7Ctwgr%5E50868c1df8a9b754e43f660097df3e98a413ed04%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcall-of-duty-is-crossing-over-with-fallout-tv-show-in-season-1-reloaded%2F1100-6537059%2F">teased</a> the latest post-apocalyptic<em> Call of Duty</em> crossover with silhouettes of the Amazon show’s main characters, including Walton Goggins’ Ghoul and Aaron Moten’s Maximus in his Brotherhood Power Armor. The skins come just in time for the release of <em>Fallout</em> season 2 and an underwhelming launch for <em>Black Ops 7</em>. It’s not yet clear if players who want to run around Nuketown in Power Armor will be able to unlock it as part of the event pass or need to buy it separately.</p> <h2>Two years later, viral police-cam-footage game gets a big backer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bodycam-fps-police-shooting-unrecord-unreal-engine-1850358473"><em>Unrecord</em> blew up</a> thanks to a 2023 trailer that made the FPS look almost indistinguishable from a found-footage movie. The game that some were skeptical even really existed is now being funded by Tencent. Will it be the next <em>Ready or Not</em>?</p> <p>“In Tencent, we’ve found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision,” Theo Hiribarne wrote (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/unrecord/bodycam-fps-game-tencent-backing"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in <em>Unrecord</em> early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>

 <h2>A cult arcade classic comes to home consoles 30 years later</h2>  <p><em>The Outfoxies</em>, a Namco arena fighter for arcades that was directed by <em>Soul Calibur</em> producer Masuya Ohishi<em>,&nbsp;</em>is finally playable on modern machines. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-cult-namco-arcade-game-which-may-have-inspired-smash-bros-has-been-given-its-first-ever-home-release/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that the game was potentially one of the inspirations behind Nintendo’s own platform fighter <em>Smash Bros</em>. The new Arcade Classics version from Hamster Corporation is single-player on Switch 1 and PS4 but has split-screen and additional modes on Switch 2 and PS5.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo wins a 15-year-old lawsuit over the Wii Remote</h2> <p>It sued BigBen Interactive, now owned by Nacon, for infringing on its Wii Remote technology with unlicensed third-party controllers. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/"><em>The Games Fray</em> reports</a> that Nintendo secured $8.2 million in damages in a recent ruling after years of BigBen successfully delaying proceedings. Nacon will still appeal the ruling, however, so this cold case will drag on a bit more.</p>

 <h2><em>Kingdom Two Crowns</em> might get a spiritual successor</h2> <p>Developer Stumpysquid has been resurrected by Raw Fury cofounder Gordon Van Dyke, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/raw-fury-co-founder-resurrects-kingdom-two-crowns-developer-stumpysquid-seeks-partners-and-investors-for-new-game"><em>Gamesindustry.biz</em> reports</a>. It’s looking for investors and probably developers to make a “micro-strategy survival game” which “builds on the same design fundamentals that shaped <em>Kingdom Two Crowns</em>, while exploring new mechanics, themes, and systems to deliver a distinct and contemporary experience.”</p> <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-two-crowns-doesn-t-feel-like-a-sequel-but-it-s-1831052985"><em>Kingdom</em> games’ 2D pixel-art take</a> on tower defense was great and I’d love to see a new one draft off the current explosion in <a href="https://kotaku.com/thronefall-islanders-tower-defense-strategy-steam-pc-1850701534">great minimalist strategy games</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-many-dudes-crashlands-butterscotch-shenanigans-interview-2000652567">The <em>Crashlands</em> devs are back with something new and it looks really neat</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">Video game consoles are crashing out to 1995 levels.

<p>Former Larian employees have responded to the CEO’s recent comments about AI, with one saying, “Show your employees some respect.” </p>



<p>Larian has been a hot topic in the news lately and not always for the best reasons. Last week, we saw Larian reveal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity</a>, which brought some hype into the fan base. However, a few days ago, the Larian boss’s comments on AI caught fire on social media, and now former employees are responding. </p>

<p>For a few days, Larian has been taking flak for using AI. Swen Vincke, the founder, stated, “I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it.” Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/show-your-employees-some-respect-former-baldurs-gate-3-and-divinity-devs-claim-larian-heads-are-lying-about-people-being-okay-with-using-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a former employee has responded to the comment, stating that Larian is lying about everyone in the company being okay with it. </p>



<p>Anne Méthot, a former QA tester at Larian on <a href="https://x.com/GangstHannah/status/2000958281917866440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), has stated that, after working at Larian, they aren’t surprised by the new AI stuff, alleging that Swen Vincke is “lying about people being okay with it”. Another former employee, Selena Tobin, has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they “loved working at Larian studios until AI”. Tobin asked the developers to show their employees some respect, as they are world-class and “do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.” </p>



<p>Swen Vincke has already posted on X to say they aren’t “pushing hard” to replace concept artists with AI. A new post on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> also states that their “successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make. In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.” Larian will hold an Ask Me Anything after the holiday break to provide more insight. </p>

<p>Once again, the Switch 2 is absolutely dominating the competition, selling another 190,944 units to result in a current total of 3,362,777. The PS5 Digital Edition, meanwhile, is certainly benefitting from the recent price cut in Japan, but its 12,671 units sold wasn't enough to bag second place. That honour goes to the Switch Lite, which managed 14,885.</p>
<p>Combined sales of the Switch is 31,344, while the PS5 managed 18,912.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckreation Developer Turns to Patreon to Keep the Studio Alive]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-developer-three-fields-entertainment-turn-to-patreon-to-keep-studio-alive/</link>
            <guid>1387444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Three Fields Entertainment, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">founded by former Burnout developers</a> who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">released the open-world sandbox racer</a> Wreckreation, a game where you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">edit your race track and the world around you with a press of a button</a>, has launched a Patreon page to help keep the studio alive.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">launch this past October</a> was a commercial disappointment for Three Fields Entertainment, with players criticizing the myriad of technical issues and a lack of content at launch. It was so poor that a little over a month after launch, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">announced via a LinkedIn post that the entire studio's staff had been put on redundancy notice</a>, meaning they could all be laid off if things didn't improve.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark</em>," Sperry wrote in her post at the top of December. "<em></em><em>We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form.</em>"</p>



<p>That hasn't happened as of yet, but what has happened is that Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/u10680381">has launched a Patreon page to try to keep the studio alive</a>. The studio announced the Patreon page with <a href="https://x.com/ArcadeDriving/status/2000880860216660386">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, which it says was created as a response to players who asked how they could support the studio.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing the Three Fields Entertainment Patreon‼️</p><p>Following our post on December 4th so many of you have asked how you can support us and we’re pleased to announce that we now have a direct way to do that! We have four tiers to choose from, with various rewards for each. More… <a href="https://t.co/3m0PfxrVTo">pic.twitter.com/3m0PfxrVTo</a></p></div>— Wreckreation Game (@ArcadeDriving) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadeDriving/status/2000880860216660386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>Patreon helps us keep our 10 person development team together and continue updating Wreckreation with the speed and responsiveness you've already seen</em>," the Patreon page reads, "<em>and we're doing this now because the next few months are crucial</em>."</p>



<p>The Patreon page continues to be, seemingly, very transparent about the realities that Three Fields is facing. The studio estimates it needs about $65,000 a month to keep the team together and the studio alive. It's currently looking for additional funding by trying to find new partners and pitching new projects, but we've seen studios shut down or, at the very least, <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/">incur serious layoffs</a> while they look for funding from a new partner.</p>



<p>It's a difficult time <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">across the video games industry</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/keybanc-we-believe-intel-has-won-the-gpu-gaming-socket-for-the-nintendo-switch-3-on-18a-and-amd-faces-increasing-risks-from-a-price-war-with-intel/">across the tech industry overall</a>, with layoffs, studio shut-downs, and the constant concern of both happening hanging over the heads of developers. Hopefully, Three Fields Entertainment's story ends differently than how it ends for the majority of teams.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-slashes-its-ryzen-5-gaming-laptop-16ram-1tb-ssd-by-65-as-year-end-clearance-expands-2000654339</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking for a new gaming laptop? You don’t have to look far for one, especially if you’re looking to save some money. We’ve found an excellent one that you can pick up right now that’ll let you enjoy some of the biggest games around. And it’s all just in time for the holiday season’s arrival.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">Case in point: the Lenovo 15″ Gaming Laptop, which is now just $700, down from its usual price of $2,000.</a> That is a discount of $1,300 and 65% off. As you’re more than likely aware, gaming PCs are often extremely expensive. So getting one for this price is absolutely fantastic, especially with this deep discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A capable gaming laptop that’s lightweight yet powerful</h2>
<p>But let’s get to the specifics so you know what you’re getting. This laptop has a AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD to hold all the games you want to install and more. It’s a fairly powerful machine for the money that brings serious gaming and productivity to your fingertips without the bulk of a desktop. Because most importantly, it’s portable, and you’ll want to be able to take it with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>To that point, this laptop has a deliciously sharp 15-inch screen. So whether you’re playing games, watching videos, or creating a presentation with video or other media, you get a crystal clear picture. The display size is a good balance between portable and roomy enough for multitasking, so you don’t have to feel cramped when you have multiple windows open.</p>



<p>Because its processor has plenty of horsepower for most tasks, if you’re looking to play games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or one of the best games of the year you can do that alongside multitasking. In fact, if you like gaming, you’ll appreciate the way it keeps frame rates steady in a lot of popular games. It also makes video editing, photo work, and streaming smoother than you might expect at this price point.</p>
<p>Connectivity is important too, and this Lenovo gaming laptop doesn’t let you down. You get a range of ports that make it easy to plug in accessories like a mouse, external drive, or headset. Whether you want to hook up to a bigger screen or plug in your favorite peripherals, it gives you all the options you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">If it’s time to go ahead and pick up a new gaming laptop, check out this deal before it’s gone</a>. You’ll want to put it to work as soon as possible with all the great games that have come out over the year, with plenty more to come. You won’t want to skip out on this discounted laptop, especially at this price, so go ahead and lock it in.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[These 12 Movies Have A Higher RT Score Than Avatar 3]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-score-spongebob-squarepants-2000654602</link>
            <guid>1387432</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look out, Neytiri, you’ve got some competition in the form of a yellow talking sponge that lives under the sea and wears pants that are quite square in shape. At least that’s what Rotten Tomatoes indicates, with the site showing <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> performing worse with critics than a bunch of films that might surprise you.</p> <p>Releasing December 19 nationwide, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> continues the story of those blue cat alien people on that planet that looks like the coolest Unreal Engine 5 demo you’ve ever seen. This time, however, there are other alien cat people who aren’t all chill and into nature. These wild ones are into fire and destruction, and are causing chaos in the third entry in the blockbuster series. But perhaps more chaotic than that is the fact that <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_fire_and_ash"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> is sitting at 68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes</a> with 187 reviews, a drop compared to past installments. The first <em>Avatar</em> in 2009 sits at 81 percent and its 2022 sequel, <em>Way of Water</em>, has a solid 76 percent. I wonder if the lack of a big gap between releases and the tech not seeming as wild in this latest film has hurt perceptions of it.</p>

 <p>Here are some recent films that have higher Rotten Tomatoes scores. And yeah, RT is just an aggregation site and shouldn’t be treated as the gospel, but a lower score might throw a wrench in the works for the third <em>Avatar</em> movie, hurting its chances of making the billions the past films have, though I fully expect it to still do gangbusters over the weekend.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair – 100%</em></li> <li><em>The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Zootopia 2 – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Thunderbolts – 88%</em></li> <li><em>Bad Guys 2 -87%</em></li> <li><em>Predator Badlands – 86%</em></li> <li><em>Superman – 83%</em></li> <li><em>Dog Man – 82%</em></li> <li><em>Ballerina: From the World of John Wick – 75%</em></li> <li><em>Black Phone 2 – 72%</em></li> <li><em>Lilo + Stitch – 72%</em></li> </ul> <p>So yeah, the latest <em>Avatar</em> movie is losing critically to the newest <em>SpongeBob</em> movie. Perhaps movie critics just love that new tie-in song from Ice Spice, “Big Guy.”</p>  <p>Or perhaps SpongeBob truly is the big guy, and indeed, when compared to Cameron and his blue cat people, his pants are okay. But hey, at least Cameron can take solace in the fact that<em> Avatar 3</em> is better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><em>Wicked: For Good.</em> </a>Oh, and the fact that this new <em>Avatar</em> installment is likely to be the biggest movie of the year, like the past films were in 2009 and 2022.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced a new 60 FPS update for The Division on PS5, making the game better suited for current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>In 2025, all we have heard about the Tom Clancy’s Division franchise is details on the sequel. Last we heard about the game was in August, when we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-year-7-roadmap-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 7 Roadmap</a>, and it was also revealed that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘saved’ by a team of 5 developers</a>. Now, towards the end of the year, a new announcement has arrived for the 2016 The Division game. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-now-has-60-fps-on-ps5">The Division Now Has 60 FPS on PS5</h2>



<p>Revealed by a new post on <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Tom Clancy’s The Division is the latest 2016 title to receive a current-gen update in 2025. However, the new update only increases the framerate to 60 FPS; there are no details about the resolution. The blog post states that players can expect smoother gameplay in the snow-covered streets of New York thanks to the enhanced performance. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agents, The Division is now available on PlayStation 5 with enhanced performance at 60 FPS. This update brings smoother gameplay to the snow-covered streets of New York where it all began. <a href="https://t.co/NGWkp0brvn">pic.twitter.com/NGWkp0brvn</a></p>— Tom Clancy's The Division (@TheDivisionGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Tom Clancy’s The Division centers on a deadly pandemic that has struck New York City. You are part of a unit of tactical agents that are trained to operate independently to save society. The title features a massive co-op campaign, where you can join other agents to fight the outbreak in Manhattan, across a wide range of story missions and open-world activities. The map features dynamic events, loot, and crafting of new weapons and gear. Players also have tons of different modes to play through, including ncursions, Underground, Survival, the Dark Zone, and more. </p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-acquired-developers-march-of-giants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the developers of March of Giants</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">director of Splinter Cell Remake</a> has returned to Ubisoft to finish the game.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-2-the-final-preview-ign-first</link>
            <guid>1387426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/ign-first-highonlife2-7-handsonpreview-banner-1766006046128.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When I sat down to play High on Life 2 for the first time, I was optimistic but also slightly skeptical. I’m hardly alone when I say that I loved the first one – it was a rare example of a genuinely funny game and it happened to be an excellent first-person shooter to boot. But making sequels to comedies is no sure thing – just look at the long list of great comedy films that got bad follow-ups. How would a video game comedy sequel fare?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the hour of High on Life 2 I played is any indication, it’s got a great chance to be as funny as – and possibly even more fun on the gameplay side than – the 2022 original. In that hour alone, I wandered around a beautiful beachside alien town, met a semi-depressed new gun named Travis and got completely wasted with him, impressed some alien teenagers with my skateboarding skills, circumcised a giant alien phallus with a laser, stole the fedora from the 1996 movie Dunston Checks In, tried (unsuccessfully) to solve a murder mystery, and bounty-hunted a billionaire who, yes, met his demise. Did I laugh along the way? Yup. Is the first-person shooter combat improved from the original? Certainly. Did I appreciate the variety of gameplay within this small slice of the campaign? Most definitely yes. Like I said, I went in optimistic, but when my demo ended I was more excited than ever for High on Life 2’s February 13, 2026 release.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Skate or Die</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I began in Pinkline Harbor, a beach town with a bar, a skate shop, a bar and grill overlooking the sea, and more. It didn’t take long for me to find trouble, as a pair of fellow bounty hunters accosted me and eventually recognized me as a mark with a big bounty on my own head. After taking them out, the bottleneck was clear and I was free to explore the harbor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This gave me my first taste of High on Life 2’s new traversal mechanic: skateboarding. I’ve played a lot of first-person shooters in my day, but I’m not sure I’ve ever played an FPS with skateboarding in it until now. And I have to say, I love how developer Squanch Games has implemented it here. It’s basically your run function. When you press the sprint button, your outlaw hero deploys their board and starts riding. You can grind on rails to really get around the open playspaces faster, and you’ve got momentum like an actual skateboard does, too, allowing you to catch air if you’re skating in, say, an empty pool on a cruise ship. I’m really interested to see how the skateboarding gets utilized throughout the campaign; I already saw it incorporated into a basic puzzle in my demo.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure I’ve ever played an FPS with skateboarding in it until now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After solving that simple locked-door puzzle with the help of my skateboard, I cruised into Pinkbellies Bar and Grill and met Travis, a down-on-his-luck alien (who happens to be a gun) who’s getting drunk at the bar after a fight with his wife. It’s here we see a welcome tweak to the first High on Life: you now have dialogue choices for each of your gun characters; if you choose one that’s from a different gun than what you’re holding, you’ll put that gun away and take out the one whose response you’ve chosen. This allows for plenty of funny options, and while I wouldn’t say this alone encourages replayability, if you do happen to run through High on Life 2 more than once, at least you can ensure that you won’t hear all of the exact same dialogue.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hold Your Liquor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve got to keep Travis happy as you pretend to be his drinking buddy, as he’s got a spare ticket for the cruise ship you need to get aboard, since that’s where your target – the billionaire Larry Pinkstock – is believed to be. And so there’s a literal Happy-O-Meter that you’ll fill by dancing in a DDR-like minigame, playing darts while hammered, and drawing a portrait of Travis. Naturally, this leads to a bar fight and you vomiting and blacking out and waking up on the beach. Did my actions during any part of this gameplay sequence seem to really matter? Not really. But did I laugh throughout it? Absolutely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, getting aboard the ship isn’t as easy as simply walking onto it; you’ll need to fight your way through some more bounty-hunting bad guys. This battle gives you a good sense of how traversal – from the skateboard to using Knifey as a grappling hook – is organically woven into combat. If you keep moving you’ll be tough to bring down, particularly when you mix in frequent use of each gun’s special attack; they’re each on a cooldown, so you can’t spam them. Combat definitely feels more layered in this sequel than it did in the first game. In other words, you’ve got more options at your disposal in any given encounter, and that’s a good thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat definitely feels more layered in this sequel than it did in the first game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once aboard the ship, called the Pinkline Panacea, you’ll need to give up your guns at the security checkpoint before enjoying the perks of your VIP ticket – which includes the highlight of the evening, a murder mystery party. Thus, getting dressed up for the big event is a must, so Travis buys you both wild, matching Austin Powers-looking purple suits from a vendor who looks suspiciously like an alien version of John Waters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Laser That Wiener</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I needed to get my friends – aka my guns – back, and so Travis and I wandered into Pinkstock’s museum to search for them. We didn’t find them, but we did find the fedora worn by Dunston the orangutan in Dunston Checks In, which Travis instantly became obsessed with. So, how to get it for him without alerting security? Well, as luck would have it, the adjacent museum piece is a giant alien phallus, set up for museum patrons to circumcise using the circumcision laser. I won’t spoil the puzzle solution, but let’s just say that yes, I did get Travis that fedora. And acquiring it was a very funny process.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More exploration of the ship led us to the Lido Deck, where a gang of unruly teens had managed to get their hands on Knifey. And in a clear humorous nod to Tony Hawk, the teens agreed to return Knifey – if I showed off my skateboarding skills by collecting the letters scattered around the deck…that happened to spell out the word “gonads.” L-O-L. And as you can already see, High on Life 2 is chock full of variety, and I haven’t even told you about the best part of my demo yet… </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Whodunnit?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">After battling some more bounty hunters on the Lido Deck who were looking to cash in on the price on my head, I made my way back to my cabin and passed out before the party. Once we got to the VIP murder mystery bash, I found four strange fellow guests, and soon our mysterious host appeared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I expected a <em>very </em>light bit of clue-gathering in this sequence, and if that’s all it had been, High on Life 2 still would’ve earned points in my book for continuing to mix up the gameplay. However, developer Squanch Games had other ideas. The murder mystery is no joke, both tonally and difficulty-wise. The team clearly took this section very seriously, and as such you’ll need to talk to all four suspects repeatedly, scour the room for both obvious and hidden clues, make notes in your on-screen notepad, and eventually not just accuse one of the four, but have collected enough evidence and made enough connections to establish a motive and credibly pin the crime on one of them. I’m purposely not going to say any more about this because I don’t want to spoil any of it for you, but I’ll admit that while I did end up accusing the correct person, I hadn’t solidly established a motive, and thus, I failed to solve the murder mystery. I can’t wait to play this again in the final version of the game in order to take another crack at it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Who’s the Boss?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I escaped the murder mystery via a water slide that took me to the lower deck. This led to another big battle where I got to test out another new weapon in High on Life 2: the Flint Turtles. They’re temporary-use pickups in the practical sense, and in the literal sense, they’re adorable reptiles who happen to breathe fire, making for convenient single-use flamethrowers. One miniboss fight and a few more rounds of regular combat later and I finally found myself at the end of my demo in a proper boss fight against Kreg, the leader of the bounty hunter gang that had been harassing me throughout my demo. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kreg proved to be a pretty traditional first-person shooter boss foe. He had attack patterns to learn and weak moments where I could really let him have it. I wouldn’t say this fight was better than the excellent boss battles in the first High on Life, but it was an engaging enough encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All told, I was pleasantly surprised by my hour with High on Life 2. Not surprised that it was good, to be clear – I expected that – but rather delighted by just how nicely the gameplay has evolved from the first game, and how much smart, funny, and unexpected variety there was throughout the gameplay. I wasn’t simply shooting the entire time. Far from it! If the whole of High on Life 2 matches what my one-hour slice brought to the table, then it’s going to be a very welcome addition to Xbox – including Game Pass on day one – PC, and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

The IGN staff has rounded up the best PC gaming had to offer in 2025 and pitted them against each other in a free-for-all Quake match for the crown… okay, actually we just nominated our top five and then voted on a winner, though we'll also be shouting out a few more standouts that are worth highlighting alongside them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, the PC list comes with a few funny caveats alongside its console-based competition – or, more specifically, because of the fact that it's not <em>really</em> trying to fight in that age-old war. PCs have long acted as a bit of a catchall for gaming as a hobby, and that's been more true than ever in recent years as nearly every (non-Nintendo) "exclusive" seems to make its way to Steam at some point. Certain games on this list can feel a little more PC-focused than others, but some of the selections here might look a bit familiar if you've followed out console awards. That's the nature of our multi-platform hobby. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PC Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two games worth shouting out that didn't make our best PC shortlist are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> – strategy games have a comfy home here, and while the genre is is a little tougher to penetrate than likes of RPGs and action games, its undeniable that 2025 has been a great year for 4X fans. Similarly, mouse-and-keyboard diehards had plenty to sink their teeth into this year with awesome FPS options like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, all of which are sitting comfortably as nominees for our Best Shooter category. There were also some excellent indie roguelike hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ball-x-pit">Ball x Pit</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/megabonk">Megabonk</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> that can feel at home on PC. That's not to mention another great RPG that just got pushed out of the top five here in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, as well as the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, both of which made our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-xbox-game-of-2025">Best Xbox</a> nominations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-1765894953348.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation around the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was almost entirely dominated by difficulty when it first arrived. It's a brutally challenging platformer, often unforgiving but never outright unfair, and one that truly tested those who tried to conquer its seemingly endless map. But to boil Silksong down to <em>only</em> discussions of difficulty does it a disservice. Whether or not that one run back to a boss is too long, or that fake save bench that actually drops you into a pit of poison water is too mean (it's not, it's hilarious), there is <em>so much</em> Silksong does right, or more often brilliantly, that make it a truly stunning achievement overall. Its world is detailed and beautiful, its characters are charming and cleverly written, its music is consistently fantastic, and its branching paths let you explore and grow stronger no matter which direction you go, always giving you options if you hit a physical or metaphorical wall. The story it tells is also touching and nuanced, told through a lead character that has become a standout. Silksong is a game that nails nearly everything it attempts, and a sequel that was absolutely worth the wait.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Blue Prince</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-blue-prince-1765894965856.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to underestimate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>. In fact, it's easy to reach the credits, play deep into its endgame, and <em>still </em>underestimate just how much is hidden in the shifting halls of the roguelike puzzler. A smart blend of genres that come together to make something not quite like anything else we've played before, Blue Prince is one of those singular puzzle games that hooks you hard and then makes you wish you could wipe your mind and play it all over again once you're finally through. Its only frustration comes in the form of its randomness, but even that is woven in masterfully as a beast that can be tamed with skill, knowledge, and plenty of permanent upgrades. It somehow strikes the same tone as games like Myst, but with the enticing "just one more run" of wildly different all-time contenders like Slay The Spire. That's a hard line to walk, but Blue Prince strides along it with grace.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Hades 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-hades-2-1765894985780.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Hollow Knight: Silksong, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> had the unenviable task of following in the footsteps of an absolute giant. How do you improve on something already so close to perfection? Well, developer Supergiant's strategy was to go bigger bigger bigger. It doesn't revolutionize what made the original Hades so incredible, but it does offer a distinctly different flavor of it, and then stuffs that refreshed package full of so many new areas, enemies, systems, and upgrade options that it more than fulfills the role of a true and proper sequel. Melinoë's journey to kill the titan of time is also a fun twist on a familiar formula, and her moveset and weapon options masterfully shake up the still excellent action without overcomplicating anything – that's why although it didn't win the top spot here, it was crowned our best action game of 2025. And, of course, all of that is complimented by the same gorgeous sense of style and hypnotizing soundtrack that helped the first game leave such a lasting mark.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-1765894998565.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may command the center of the RPG stage in 2025, but overlooking <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> dancing right alongside it would be a mistake. This massive medieval adventure could keep you playing well past the 100-hour mark, with tons of stories to unravel and quests to complete. Most notably of all, those tasks come with lots of choices to make that give you a hand in how this tale plays out, as well as the burden of living with the consequences of your actions. We've been waiting a long time already for The Elder Scrolls 6, and it seems like we'll be waiting a long time still, but Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a phenomenal alternative before that day ever comes – and is far from a consolation prize in the meantime, standing as a very impressive RPG that very well could have been claiming the top spot of many a list in a year that wasn't dominated by a certain French game...</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-pc-game-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765895014393.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn't blame you if you feel like rolling your eyes at the absolute sweep <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has rolled out for award ceremonies across both IGN and the games industry as a whole, but becoming so used to it winning everything from best-ofs to costume contests throughout the month of December doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to. This distinctly (perhaps even aggressively) French RPG doesn't really do a ton we haven't seen elsewhere before, transparently owing loads to the plenty of Japanese-made RPGs that so clearly inspired it – but it does bring together loads of familiar pieces and assembles them in a way that feels fresh and new. The exciting and varied action elements of its turn-based combat, the interesting twist on a post-apocalyptic plot, and the powerhouse strength of the ensemble cast fueling the heart of it all. Add to all this that it's come from a brand new developer that clearly understands how to punch above its weight – not to mention it came out of the gate swinging with a PC version that didn't require frantic post-launch patching to be optimized – and it's not hard to understand why Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is our winner for Best PC Game of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Got a different pick?

            <p>
Last year, myself, Brendy and Graham  got fearfully excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>, a bountiful free 1v1 FPS with map designs calibrated to nostalgiafuck anybody who ever played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> over an LAN or hoarded shareware CDs. Our fever burned all the hotter for knowing that Straftat is the work of them wot did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, the amazing Brutalist exploration game from 2022.
</p>
<p>
Brendy and Graham have now left the Treehouse, alas, so there is nobody here to get excited with me about VHOLUME, a first-person parkour game from one of the Straftat developers. I am sitting alone in my room, sorrowfully punching the air, tears pooling around my ankles and threatening to short-circuit the PC. Just as well it's a single player experience, I guess.

<p>
VHOLUME is the work of Léonard Lemaitre, the aforesaid Straftat dev, plus Nathan Grange and Niels Tiercelin, who I'm not familiar with. It's being published by IronEqual. The game casts you as Robert, a man galloping through "the derelict capital of Afro-Eurasia", ruled by a tyrannical Ministry. He's on a mission to restore his family's revoked ration tickets. Quite what this has to do with parkour remains to be seen. It doesn't look like there are any other humans in the setting.
</p><p>
It's another dystopian Brutalist world of canted slabs, yawning concrete turbines, and slit windows stacked in such a way as to inspire massive trypophobia. In some of the screens, it looks like there's some liveable urban architecture. In others, it looks like a continuation of Straftat's abstract level mash-up ethos, with blocks jutting from mist.</p>
<p>The tech is less 90s than that of Straftat or Babbdi, with softer, diffuse lighting and shadows. I'm not sure which aesthetic I prefer. VHOLUME is a handsome beast, but it's sort of like they rubbed Straftat down with scented oils.
</p>
<p>
Expect "movement-centric gameplay where the player can jump, run, climb and slide with great freedom". True princes of parkour "can exploit momentum, discover shortcuts, and break the labyrinthine design, making each run a test of skill and efficiency as they chase target times."</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, and no trailer, but you can find some gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131730/VHOLUME/">Steam page</a>. I imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> fans who can live without the radiance of that game's City of Glass might enjoy this. As will people who relished last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>.</p>
