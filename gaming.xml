          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Deciding which of <strong>The First Berserker Khazan's weapons</strong> to pick is more important than you might think at first glance. Any weapon technically works. However, the game doesn't hand out skill points quickly--nor do they carry over between weapon skill trees. Our First Berserker Khazan weapons guide explains which ones are worth your time and why.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Dual_Wield">Dual Wield</h2><p dir="ltr">Dual Wield is what you start Khazan with, and this weapon type is much more than just the standard hack-and-slash device it resembles at first glance. Once you start investing skill points in the Ruthless tree, you unlock some exceptionally useful abilities. Frenzy and the Breeze skills let you string together dash attacks to perform a series of slashes that only stops when you stop pressing the attack input. It overwhelms standard enemies and smaller guardians, and it can take a chunk out of a boss enemy as well, or at least their stamina meter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467007"></a><figcaption>Dual Wield is your starting weapon, but that doesn't make it bad.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dual Wield also has some excellent upgrades for your basic attack, including one that lets you create chain combos with different effects depending on when you press certain inputs. There's one that flings you into the air and has you crash onto an enemy's head, though attacks with faster, more fluid animations tend to be safer and more effective in this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Potent Blow tree is a bit underwhelming compared to the spear's, but the Penetrate tree--oddly named, since it's tied to evasion skills--rewards you for successful dodges by powering up your basic attacks and the chains you build with them.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Greatswords">Greatswords</h2><p dir="ltr">Greatswords are a bit awkward in Khazan. They hit hard and can easily take down standard enemies with one blow, but they're also very slow. Slowness isn't what you want when you're surrounded by enemies or struggling to find an opening against a speedy boss. However, the payoff comes as much from taking a large chunk out of a guardian's HP bar as it does from quickly reducing their stamina.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467009" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467009"></a><figcaption>The Greatsword is powerful, but slow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Greatsword takes more practice to use effectively than the other two weapons, in other words, but many of its skills are also more underwhelming. You can charge the sword to deal more damage, block while charging strong attacks, and deal more damage if you take damage while you attack. That's all fine enough, but unlocking Greatsword skills feels more like mitigating the weapon's issues and not giving yourself new ways to use it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Spears">Spears</h2><p dir="ltr">The spear is a versatile weapon that combines the best parts of Dual Wield and Greatswords. You get longer reach like with the Greatsword, along with Dual Wield's faster movement, plus the ability to catch multiple enemies with your attacks and some flashy, fun combos as well. Spear skill categories have a lot going on. The swift attack branch creates duplicates of Khazan that attack immediately after he does, essentially doubling your damage, while the strong attack branch channels some fighting game energy by encouraging you to chain different combos and inputs to end up with a few unique finishing moves.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these are designed to overwhelm enemies and keep them from attacking, while also pushing them back. It's useful for crowd control and, in areas with cliffs and ledges, for shoving foes to their doom without having to actually fight them. That doesn't work on boss guardians, though.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467010"></a><figcaption>Fast and flashy, the spear is an excellent choice.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Further down the skill tree, the spear lets you learn attacks that change depending on whether you've broken an enemy's stance, for example, dealing additional damage or instantly repositioning you behind them. While it takes some time to learn heavy-hitting skills that work against bosses, you do eventually get access to those as well. It's a brilliant weapon whose only downside is that it scales with Proficiency and Willpower. Those are stamina-influencing stats that do little for Khazan's strength, so you won't deal <em>quite</em> as much damage as you might with Dual Wield or Greatswords.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_the_best_weapon_in_First_Berserker__Khazan_">What is the best weapon in First Berserker: Khazan?</h2><p dir="ltr">We recommend <strong>specializing in two weapons</strong>, so you can change your approach depending on what situation you're facing. Spear is the easiest to learn and has the most potential for strong combos and crowd control. Dual Wield is our second pick thanks to its speed and versatility, even if it doesn't have quite the range of options you get from the spear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-finals-joins-game-pass-season-6-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox announced that Embark Studios' team-based multiplayer shooter THE FINALS is now available on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/26/game-pass-free-to-play-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass Ultimate</a> and PC Game Pass. Just eight days ago, season 6 of THE FINALS began, where there are now even more ways to compete with each other, as well as an updated arsenal to provide more variety in gameplay.</p>
<p>Team Deathmatch has now become a permanent Quickplay mode for Season 6. There are now six arenas that you can play in. By jumping into Quick Play, you can fight off against other players to try and get yourself on the leaderboard and earn progression rewards. Similar to the World Tour, you will now earn points regardless of how the match turns out, allowing you to progress through the season a little bit faster to get rewards. Of course, winning a match does reward you with more points.</p>
<p>With the RISING STARS Battle Pass, there are 106 rewards to collect that are inspired by the Golden Age of sports entertainment. This includes outfits, emotes, and more. For those with the Premium Battle Pass, you'll be able to earn 1575 Multibucks, which will allow you to afford the next season's pass and some extra cosmetics if you like.</p>
<p>There is also a free track available, where you can unlock 26 rewards, including Multibucks and outfits, to show off your flair in the game.</p>
<p>For those who are planning on playing THE FINALS through Game Pass, there will be specific benefits that you will receive for playing through Game Pass. This includes the Stryker Grid Set, sponsored by Ivada, which will give you a full outfit, three weapon skins, a charm, and a 25% boost to Match XP. When you claim your prize, you will also be given 500 Multibucks.</p>
<p>As there is a new season taking place, there are now three new weapons to experiment with, including a brand-new Minigun.</p>
<p>This season also sees three Sponsors, named OSPUZE, ALFA ACTA and ENIGMO, respectively. They all have their own benefits, which is explained on the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for THE FINALS, where you can make your decision as to who you want to compete for.</p>
<p>As with every season, there are major <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/">quality-of-life changes</a> that have been implemented, including a bunch of improvements and revamps to make THE FINALS a smoother experience overall. This includes an overhaul to The Store and a new coat of paint for the Las Vegas Stadium.</p>
<p>There is much more included in this season of THE FINALS, which can all be found on the game's official website, where the patch notes break down everything you need to know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the saddest developments this week--and it has had some competition--has been <a href="https://www.404media.co/hayao-miyazaki-who-said-ai-is-insult-to-life-itself-reduced-to-ai-generated-meme-by-openai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the news that anyone using GPT-4o’s new image generation model, can now generate Studio Ghibli-style images on the fly</a>. And not images that look <em>kinda </em>like the storied animation house; images that are just straight rips of Ghibli's style.</p><p>It was a brazen move even by AI image-generation standards, and has<a href="https://mashable.com/article/studio-ghibli-ai-memes-openai-chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rightly resulted in a mountain of backlash online</a>, because singling out Ghibli of all animation styles certainly sends a message. The company's founder, Hayao Miyazaki, isn't just one of the world's most renowned animators, he's also a public (and longstanding!) opponent of AI in art:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hayao Miyazaki's thoughts on an artificial intelligence" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngZ0K3lWKRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If you consider, as Gareth Watkins<a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid out so wonderfully last month</a>, that AI, which is "embarrassing, destructive, and looks like shit" and as a result is "the new aesthetics of fascism", Altman and OpenAI's singling out of Studio Ghibli starts to make more sense. Especially when figures like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/techno-fascism-comes-to-america-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altman are being increasingly described as "technofascists"</a>. This isn't another laugh, another coy attempt at circumventing someone's rights to their creations; the way this has been pitched and sold is a direct attack, a flex revelling in the fact creators have so far proven largely powerless to stop these vultures from looting the history of human creation wholesale.</p><p>So yeah, it sucks! Which is why people need to stop sharing that shit. If you accidentally fell into it via a chat or a message from a friend or whatever, and made an image because you thought it was cute, cut it out. If you're trying to dunk on the practice by linking to articles or examples that showcase the work, inadvertently flooding people's timelines with examples of this ghoulish, stolen work, stop.</p><p>Nobody wants to see that shit. Nobody needs to see it.</p><p>The power of AI imagery isn't in its capabilities, it's in its attempts to become ubiquitous. It's (likely) illegal <em>and </em>immoral to be making this stuff, but like so much else in our 21st-century world, laws are developing much slower than technology. Companies like OpenAI are hoping that the longer their tech can stay out there, the more it becomes part of the background noise of the modern internet, and the more likely it is that they themselves will become part of the fabric of the modern internet, and not a bunch of raiders stripping the place for its creative wiring.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne"><h3>Split Keyboards Are Superior And The Reason I’m The Writer I Am Today</h3></a><p>Split keyboards are the best, but no company offered one that satisfied me completely.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> is a life sim, and so by necessity it includes a particularly obnoxious thing that most of us have to sweat every single day of our lives: money. In this case a fictional currency called Meows. Fortunately, it's a bit easier to make money in a video game like InZoi than it is in the real world, because the steps are clear and simple and don't change dramatically over time. <strong>InZoi even features a money cheat</strong> for those really looking to get ahead. But even by normal methods, once you know how to make money, you'll make money. This is good because you'll be hiring a maid service to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">deal with all the dirt that keeps filling up your house every day</a> before too long, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">that Hyundai Ioniq isn't gonna buy itself</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, the methods by which you'll earn your Meows in InZoi are fairly similar to how you'd do it on our Earth: Unless you win the lottery, you have to do some kind of work, be it a normal 9-5 job, some kind of freelance career, or even by undertaking criminal enterprises. But it's not always obvious how to do what you have to do to bring home that paper, and so we'll break it all down for you below with our list of ways to make cash in InZoi.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Use_the_InZoi_money_cheat">Use the InZoi money cheat</h2><p dir="ltr">We'll start with the shortcut. No judgement--the game's economy is a bit wonky out of the gate, so we don't blame you. To use the InZoi money cheat, you'll head into the settings. <strong>In the</strong> <strong>Psicat guide menu, you'll find a button that says "money cheat" that will grant you 100,000 meows each time you press it</strong>. Since the InZoi economy is pretty incoherent right now, there's no need to feel any guilt over cheating yourself some money at this stage of the game's development.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to use more traditional methods, however, keep reading for all other ways to make money (or Meows) in Inzoi.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Get_a_regular_job">Get a regular job</h2><p>It's the standard method for making money for most folks, and for good reason: You know exactly how much you'll make every week, and you'll earn it pretty much just for showing up. But this isn't necessarily a good way to get rich. Having a regular job is about stability and, in the case of a life sim video game, participating in one of the key rituals of modern society.</p><p dir="ltr">It's extremely easy to get an job in InZoi. You just have to open your smartphone, and click the Careers button at the bottom to show your options. You'll be able to apply for any job you want that way, and since it's not possible for the company to reject you, and there are no education or experience requirements for any career, you're guaranteed to get whatever you applied for.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466939-20250326111450_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466939" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466939-20250326111450_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466939"></a><figcaption>You can work at an idol management company in Dowon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466939-20250326111450_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are two main types of jobs to choose from: the active ones where you actually have to play while you're at the office, and the "rabbit hole" ones, which send your Zoi offscreen to some place you cannot follow them to. The rabbit hole-type jobs are better for Zois with large families, since it's one less thing to worry about during the day, and the active careers are better for Zois who live alone or have a smaller family.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first get a job, you won't make much money, so you'll need to aim for a promotion. For the rabbit hole careers, that means being rested and fed when you head to work. For the active careers, it means doing all the tasks you're given. You can only have one job at a time, but having a day job doesn't preclude you from also earning money by the other methods below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Make_things_and_sell_them">Make things and sell them</h2><p dir="ltr">Everybody's had pretty much the same get-rich-quick scheme in The Sims for decades now: crafting stuff, like paintings and furniture, and then selling it for cash. The crafting methods available in InZoi are pretty much the same as what The Sims 4 offers: painting, writing books, composing music, and so on. The results, however, are less consistent than in The Sims. You might put together a "perfect" painting worth 5,000 Meows only to turn around and make a bad one that's only worth 15. This means that sometimes this type of career will feel <em>very</em> rewarding, and other times it'll just feel bad.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Resort_to_crimes">Resort to crimes</h2><p>You can also earn your Meows by less-than-honest methods, though it's likely you won't even see the options to do so at first--outright <strong>criminal acts are only possible for Zois who have bad karma</strong>. Fortunately, it's not difficult to get bad karma pretty quickly, as all you have to do is go outside and start being rude to everyone who walks by. After 15 minutes of insulting random people, you should start unlocking new options like shoving somebody to the ground, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">robbing ATMs</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466940-2025-03-26-15-30-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466940" data-ratio="0.56288478452067" data-width="2274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466940-2025-03-26-15-30-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466940"></a><figcaption>If you really need some quick cash, you can always rob an ATM.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466940-2025-03-26-15-30-54.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Just be careful, though, as there are major potential consequences, including jail time if you're caught doing a robbery--though we do have a guide to help you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">get out of jail in InZoi</a>.

That said, the banks in InZoi don't give out money to just anybody--just like in the real world, the bank will have to approve you for a loan before it hands you the big check.

Everything is IP, all of the time, everywhere you look now, because big wigs in suits have got it in their heads that original, uniquely appealing content just can't win over a combination of pixels that resemble something someone already likes. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> is no stranger to crossovers, with big, thematically relevant ones like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-thieves-finally-makes-the-most-obvious-move-ever-with-a-monkey-island-crossover">Monkey Island</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-thieves-scores-crossover-with-slightly-less-relevant-pirate-ip-pirates-of-the-caribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>, as well as some smaller ones like Halo and Banjo Kazooie. Today's crossover is one of the smaller ones, this time with, uh… Destiny. The sci-fi, first-person shooter. Huh.
</p>

<p>
Now, to be clear, like the Halo and Banjo Kazooie sets, this one is just about cosmetics, all of which were inspired by Destiny. That includes things like a ship set and crest, costume, weapons, there's no story stuff or anything like that. For the most part I don't think I'm a big fan of what's on offer, though I like the crest that's literally just Ghost dangling off the front of the ship like a Christmas bauble, that's cute.

Rare's director of brand and licensing Adam Park tried to justify the crossover a bit over on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/27/sea-of-thieves-destiny-cosmetics/">Xbox Wire blog</a>, saying that even thought it "might not seem like an obvious choice, Destiny’s classes and co-operative play presented a ‘crew-like’ bond that we thought was a great fit." I'll be honest with you Mr. Park, I'm not entirely sure I buy into that myself, the two are quite wildly different games, but I guess sometimes you've got to get the bills paid, 'ey?
</p>
<p>
In any case, the crossover is already in-game now, but it'll cost you a pretty penny. The Big Bundle, which includes every crossover item, will set you back 4999 Ancient Coins, which translates to $50 in real world money. That's live service, for you.

			<p>Ubisoft is forming with Tencent a new subsidiary based on its three most popular franchises,<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/"> as rumored in the past few months.</a></p>
<p>The new subsidiary, in which Tencent is investing 1.16 billion euros for a 25% minority stake, is based on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six brands and will include the development teams of all three series based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia as well as the back-catalog and any new games currently under development or to be developed. In regard to its relationship with Ubisoft, the new subsidiary will be granted by the publisher a worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable license in respect of the intellectual property and similar proprietary rights owned or licensable by Ubisoft in relation to the three brands in exchange for a royalty.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the creation of the new subsidiary, saying: <em>“With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success. With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.”</em></p>
<p>Martin Lau, President of Tencent, also commented on the new subsidiary formed with Ubisoft, saying: <em>"We are excited to extend our longstanding partnership with </em><em>Ubisoft through this investment, which reflects our continued confidence in Ubisoft’s creative vision and exceptional talent to drive sustained success in the industry. We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers."</em></p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s eagle-eyed players have found a hidden map that is accessed via a transition on Shoreline. It’s called The Labyrinth, and it can be found by unlocking a new door in the basement of the Resort and delving down into a mysterious ruin behind a secret, newly-added bunker door.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-labyrinth-on-escape-from-tarkov">How To Find The Labyrinth on Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>To find The Labyrinth in Tarkov, you’ll need to load into a raid on Shoreline and head to the Resort. In the basement near the gym and swimming pool complex, a new door has been added, locked by a key that you’ll find while participating in the new Shadow of Tagilla task line.</p>



<p>The key is called the Knossos LLC Facility Key.</p>



<p>Once you get past that door, you’ll go down into the depths of the building to find a new bunker door that’s locked tight – but there’s a keycard that’ll get you in.</p>



<h3 id="h-where-to-find-knossos-llc-facility-key-in-tarkov">Where to Find Knossos LLC Facility Key in Tarkov</h3>



<p>Players have reported finding the Knossos LLC Facility Key in Tarkov in Shoreline. They’ve <a href="https://x.com/inari_akagane/status/1905349168496845008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked it up</a> as loose loot just past the main entrance of the West Wing in the computer room on the desk. It has also been found in the small rooms behind the winding staircases in both the East and West wings. </p>



<p>Here’s a graphic from the <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Hidden_Layer?file=Hidden_Layer_Map_3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Wiki</a> that will help you find the Knossos LLC Facility Key:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-where-to-find-labrys-keycard-in-tarkov">Where to Find Labrys Keycard in Tarkov</h3>



<p>Players have reported finding the Labrys Keycard, which you’ll need to get into The Labyrinth, on Tagilla and from the Hot Zone quest that you pick up from Ragman after completing the BTR Driver storyline. For completing this event, you get three Labrys Keycards, <strong>and </strong>you unlock the ability to buy it.</p>



<p>To complete Hot Zone, you’ll need to stash LL4 ballistic plates in a secret location on Reserve. This location is on the rooftop of Black Knight, next to a stack of pallets.</p>



<p>From Therapist, the Labrys Keycard will cost you 268,026 rubles, and from Ref, it’s 41 GP coins.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-complete-shadow-of-tagilla-in-tarkov">How to Complete Shadow of Tagilla in Tarkov</h3>



<p>There are three tasks to complete as part of the Shadow of Tagilla event in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>The first is a Ground Zero quest given by Mechanic called Shady Contractor. This will require you to find the Knossos LLC senior manager’s car and pick up their diary, returning it to Mechanic as soon as possible. It’s the black, crashed car outside the small, boarded up car dealership.</p>



<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll unlock Needle in a Haystack. This is also given by Mechanic, and it unfolds across Ground Zero, Interchange, Streets of Tarkov, and Shoreline. To complete this, you just need to scout several locations:</p>



<ul>
<li>Courtyard park by the TerraGroup HQ on Ground Zero</li>



<li>Kart track on Interchange</li>



<li>Playground on Interchange</li>



<li>Playground near Concordia on Streets of Tarkov</li>



<li>Seaside construction site on Shoreline</li>



<li>Health Resort playground on Shoreline</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, Hidden Layer will pop, and this task is tied to Shoreline <strong>only</strong>. To finish this task, you’ll need to find the Knossos LLC Facility Key, which I’ve mentioned above. This is how you’ll get into the Knossos LLC facility beneath the Resort. Remember that you’ll still need to get the Labrys Keycard if you want to access The Labyrinth, which is the Knossos LLC facility.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-labyrinth-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is The Labyrinth in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>When you get the key <strong>and </strong>the Labrys Keycard and travel to The Labyrinth, you’ll be presented with a mysterious bunker full of haphazard loop and lore, including a reference to a <strong>nuke </strong>triggered by the Cultists that you find in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<div><article><p><span>HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT’S REAL THE NUKE IS IN THE LABRYNTH BOYS WE WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG 
THE NUKE IS REAL </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EscapefromTarkov</a></p></article></div>







<p>As the story goes, a nuke was detonated over Norvinsk, the region that houses Tarkov, to create an EMP that shut down electronics in the region, which helped to destabilise the area and create the ‘ground zero’ that we know and love exploring in this popular extraction shooter.</p>



<p>You’ll need to tread carefully as you explore The Labyrinth, as it’s filled with puzzles and booby traps, which haven’t yet been documented in maps or guides. Also, four other players can be exploring The Labyrinth at the same time, which means you’re potentially in for a tight fight.</p>



<p>The Labyrinth is available for both PvE and PvP players, which is surprising given recent events.</p>



<p>Also, as you work your way through The Labyrinth in Tarkov, you’ll eventually come face-to-face with the Shadow of Tagilla, a formidable boss that’s drastically unpredictable and very powerful.</p>

            <p>
Well, there you have it folks. After months of uncertainty over share price falls, major game delays and squabbles with investors, Ubisoft have opened up a new subsidiary to look after their biggest-selling Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> games, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> chucking in a whopping €1.16 billion - meaning that the latter will have a 25% stake in the new spin-off business when all is said and done.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Ubisoft's board have been publicly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-march-as-ubisofts-board-consider-a-company-sale">weighing up a major transaction of some kind since January</a>, with Tencent and the company's founding Guillemot brothers tipped to be in cahoots. The deal announced today is essentially about carving out the parts of Ubisoft's business that make the most money, with Tencent pouring cash into those bits rather than other, less prosperous series such as Ghost Recon and Prince Of Persia. The subsidiary will serve as the main business unit for all Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry development teams based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf">press release</a> announcing the new subsidiary adds that Tencent's investment will "strengthen Ubisoft’s balance sheet by significantly reducing their consolidated net debt position," something the developer has struggled with after a string of flops like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">XDefiant</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>.
</p>
<p>
But how will the relationship between Ubisoft and this new spin-off entity work? According to the release, the subsidiary will have a "dedicated and autonomous leadership team", but it'll still report up to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, which leaves things fuzzy. The release is equally vague about how all this could affect the direction of future Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six games. It claims the new subsidiary will "drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features." 
</p>
<p>
As for the parts of Ubisoft that aren't part of the subsidiary, there's talk of "accelerating the growth of top performing titles and leveraging disruptive technologies on selected new IPs, while continuing to deliver state-of-the-art production game engines and online services." Again, all very open-ended for the moment.
</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether all this will pay off for Ubisoft and Tencent, but Ubisoft's latest Assassin's Creed, at least, has been <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991">a big hit</a> since it launched last week, attracting over three million players. I imagine between that and the Tencent deal, Ubisoft management will be sleeping a little easier tonight.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Spring is officially here and the Epic Games Store is celebrating the occassion with a two-week long, seasonally appropriate Spring Sale. But bargain hunters can <em>also</em> pick up Epic's latest selection of free weekly games, which are available to download now.
</p>
<p>
As is customary, Epic latest freebies are available for seven days - starting today, 27th March, and continuing until next Thursday, 3rd April. After which another free title - currently listed as "mystery game" - will take over. Notably, clues suggests there's a bit of a cat theme for the duration of this year's Spring Sale, given the feline wrapping paper currently obscuring next week's title, and the two free games available right now:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat Quest</li>
<li>Neko Ghost, Jump!</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>
Cat Quest, if you're unfamiliar, is the first game in developer The Gentlebros' now three-strong casual action-RPG series. It's a lot of fun too, taking everything you'd ordinarily expect to find in an action-RPG - real-time combat, dungeon crawling, equipment progression, and so on - and turning it into a breezy, super-streamlined, pick-up-and-play package. It also has more cat puns than is probably legal, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cat-quest-8373e0">you can grab it for free here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'm less familiar with Neko Ghost, Jump!, but a quick bit of investigatory Googling reveals it to be a puzzle platformer that sees players switching between 2D and 3D perspectives as they attempt to navigate its 40+ stages. It's the work of developer Burgos Games, contains a further multitude of cats, and can be <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/neko-ghost-jump">downloaded for free on Epic here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To recap, you've gone seven days from today, 27th March, to add Epic's latest weekly freebies to your Epic Games Store library, after which they'll make way for something new. And if you do head over to Epic's digital storefront, you'll find the Spring Sale is also currently underway. This runs until 9th April, and promises up to 75 percent off selected games.

            <p>
These days, most sequels to even the most popular of games are announced a good while after whatever the latest title is. I mean, just look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, we've known it's been in the works for a while now, but it only got a formal reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">last December</a>, almost a full decade after The Witcher 3. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/saber-interactive">Saber</a> didn't wait around to announce a follow-up to last year's very popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, though, revealing that a third game is in the works just this month, about half a year on from its release. Even still, Saber would like you to know that this doesn't mean it's "abandoning" Space Marine 2.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In an update post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500568489646358807?curator_clanid=3693985">Steam</a>, Saber "set the record straight" on whether updates on Space Marine 2 would be slowing down, explaining that there aren't any team rearrangements taking place, and "no one is abandoning the game." There's still apparently plans for more content for "months to come", emphasising the Space Marine 3 is still "years away from release."
</p>
<p>
In fact, said update post even offered a few bits for the game's upcoming patch 7.0, the Trygon Update. This one's planned for a mid-April release, and is adding in a few bits and pieces. First up are a couple of DLC packs, one being the Space Wolves Chapter Pack which is, you guessed it, wolf themed, netting you a metallic wolf helmet, a wolf's head pelt for your shoulder, and some other bits, as well as an Imperial Fists Champion Pack, which mostly just makes you look a lot more yellow and a bit more regal.
</p>
<p>
A new map will also be coming to PvE called Exfiltration, which will (unsurprisingly given the name of the update) have the Trygon as a boss, a nasty, Xenomorph-looking alien that I wouldn't want to touch with a ten foot pole. You'll also be able to set up private lobbies in PvP, and a couple of general additions like a weapons perks rework and some new colours are coming too. See, more stuff! And you were worried.

Specifically, I'm referring to the Hollow Knight: Silksong folks, who are once again putting on their clown makeup after no new trailer for the long-anticipated Hollow Knight sequel surfaced at the showcase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, there's another one next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, the Silksong community has been a hot mess of anticipation and disappointment for a while. Pop into the subreddit or community Discord on a given day, and you'll be overwhelmed with constant memes and "silkposts" fantasizing, predicting, and joking about a game that seems like it will simply never arrive. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-are-ready-to-have-their-hearts-broken-again-by-tuesdays-nintendo-direct">covered their antics last year</a>, when a pair of back-to-back Directs similarly sent the community reeling, and again in January when a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">photo of chocolate cake</a> turned into a frantic search for an ARG that never was. At this point, it's honestly hard to tell from the outside looking in how much serious disappointment is involved here, and how much is just a tight-knit community of fans having a laugh every time a new showcase is announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is, admittedly, something a little more pressing about this next showcase. Hollow Knight originally released for PC, but its climb to fame really kicked into gear when it launched on Nintendo Switch the following year, which has caused many to associate it with Nintendo's consoles moreso than any of the others it's released on. There's also a sense of grandeur about the showcase next week, specifically: it's a Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-switch-2-nintendo-direct-now-has-a-time-as-well-as-a-date">intended to show off the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, likely both the hardware and possibly also several launch titles. What better place for Silksong to re-debut? While there will naturally be a number of first-party games there, Hollow Knight fans are hoping against hope that Silksong has proven anticipated and popular enough to warrant a spot at such a massive showcase...and, critically, that the game is finally ready for prime time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are Silksong fans likely about to have their hopes dashed yet again for something like the 50th time since the game was announced? I dunno, probably! There are a few other indicators that Silksong might be nearing some sort of release date announcement though. There was a passing reference to it about a week ago in an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-casual-mention-in-xbox-indies-post-sends-community-into-a-fervor">Xbox Wire post on indies</a>, though that may have just been a cheeky joke. More interestingly, there have been some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-steam-metadata-changes-that-point-to-2025-and-yes-were-doing-this-again">recent backend changes to the game's listing on Steam</a>, including a copyright year update. But we've also just spent several years getting overhyped for no reason about Silksong getting listed and delisted from various console storefronts randomly. So who knows, really?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we do know, for absolute certain, is what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake">Team Cherry marketing and publishing chief Matthew 'Leth' Griffin said</a> back in January after the cake incident. "Yes the game is real, progressing, and will release." All we can do now is sit back, wait, and dream of what it will be like living in a post-Silksong world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Get that clown make-up ready for next week, folks!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has created a new subsidiary dedicated to its three biggest IPs, bringing in a bulk investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent to have a roughly 25% minority stake for the sum of €1.16bn – the subsidiary valued at €4bn by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>This move hives off the Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry franchises, with this business unit the new home for Ubisoft’s teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. The new subsidiary will control each game from these series in the back catalogue, as well as any new games that are in development going forward.</p>


<p>The move follows a steady stream of reports that Ubisoft was looking to this creative way of raising fresh funds and investment, without handing over ownership of Ubisoft itself.</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote for the announcement. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>
<p>He continues, “With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success. With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.”</p>

<p>You’d be forgiven for reading that and thinking, “why didn’t you try that before?”&nbsp;Honestly, the main factor here is probably the “strengthening our balance sheet” part with Tencent’s funding. Ubisoft has had plenty ups and down in the last few years with some ignominious failures like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/skull-and-bones-review/">Skull and Bones</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">XDefiant</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> – some failures and other pressures have seen Ubisoft join the numerous companies enacting mass layoffs. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a major hit, thankfully, already selling millions of copies and at a far greater clip than Outlaws, and there’s the major revamp of Rainbow Six Siege coming this summer, aiming to bolster that game’s audience for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>There’s a number of stipulations to this investment deal that mean that Tencent is locked in for at least 5 years with these shares, to prevent them from exerting pressure on Ubisoft or the subsidiary by trying to pull out – though this is moot if Ubisoft ends up no-longer having a majority stake in the subsidiary. In that regard, Ubisoft must hold a majority stake for a 2-year period.</p>

Now, but not for the first time, The Pokémon Company has promised it will be addressing these shortages. It’s just that their words don’t really match reality.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196165,197298" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a new statement issued <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464">on the eve of the release of the next set Journey Together</a></span>, and posted to socials by <em>Serebii</em>’s Joe Merrick, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) explains that it’s aware of the difficulty people are having buying the cards, but promises that it is “actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible.” The thing is, that’s exactly the same thing they said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">when we contacted them back in January about the same issue</a></span>.</p><p>Here’s a quote from the new statement:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> We’re aware that some fans are experiencing difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) products due to very high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this.</p></blockquote><p>And here’s a quote from the statement in January:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re aware that some fans may experience difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products at launch due to high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this.</p></blockquote><p>Which, given there has been no noticeable increase in availability of <em>any</em> affected sets in the two months since, makes this repeated promise a little harder to take seriously. It’s almost word-for-word the same! Those who’ve been able to buy a pack of Prismatic Evolutions without paying scalped prices are the very lucky few.</p><p>The new statement goes on to say that, “For Pokémon TCG product releases at Pokémon Center, we are committed to providing a smooth purchasing experience and employ technology that helps get products into the hands of fans first and foremost.” As anyone who’s tried to use the Pokémon Center on days when new cards are made available for pre-order will tell you, this simply isn’t true.</p><p>The statement continues, “Currently, Pokémon Center implements a virtual queue for certain products to help provide a more seamless purchasing process during periods of increased site traffic.”</p><p>But TPCi has to know this isn’t working. When pre-orders for May’s set, Destined Rivals, went live this week, the site was just broken for hours. Sometimes, if you were lucky, you’d see the “queue” screen, but in my experience it never resolved to the site, and more often there was simply a message saying the site was down for repairs. To describe this as “seamless” is quite something.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-recommend-id="image://cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="864" data-height="591" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pokemon Center's message saying you're in line to visit the site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pokemon Center's message saying you're in line to visit the site." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-recommend-id="image://cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="864" data-height="591" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pokemon Center's message saying you're in line to visit the site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By the time I was able to access the site, everything was of course sold out.

And limiting purchase numbers does almost nothing against an army of bots that can make multiple purchases to multiple accounts.</p><p>It just all sucks. Tomorrow, people will line up outside stores in desperate hope of being able to find some Journey Together product, and many will miss out. Scalpers will do all they can to scoop the majority of the cards, and kids and collectors will be disappointed. What we need at this point is not a copypasta of a statement issued two-and-a-half months ago, re-promising the same things that clearly haven’t happened.</p><p>We need The Pokémon Company to get on top of this, to actually start printing and delivering product to retailers (I’ve spoken to specialist shop owners who say they cannot get answers, let alone cards to sell), and more than anything else, to drop the disingenuous statements and offer a bit more honesty and clarity. We’ve reached out to TPCi to ask for that, to get some specifics on how much more product it intends to print and how, and what practical plans it has for its websites given things clearly aren’t “seamless.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The reveal happened after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, during which Nintendo also announced virtual game cards and showcased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/" data-ref-id="1100-6530408">Metroid Prime 4</a> again. Twitter and Bluesky user Wario64 first spotted it and posted a zoomed-in version of the image to make viewing it easier.</p><p dir="ltr">We <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-burning-questions-that-mystery-button-and-more-things-we-want-to-know/2900-6135/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6135">speculated about the nature of the mystery button</a> shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo revealed the Switch 2</a> at the start of the year. At the time, it was just a blank square situated under the "Home" button on the right Joy-Con. It's roughly where the invisible NFC detector is on the original Switch, the tool that scans Amiibo. Given that the Switch 2 is slightly larger than its predecessor, it looks like there's still room for an NFC scanner even with the mysterious "C" button.</p><p dir="ltr">Granted, we still don't know what the button actually <em>does</em>. The last Nintendo console with a "C" button was the Nintendo 64, which had four of them--a set of four buttons roughly where "ABXY" is on the current Switch. Wario64's replies were full of suggestions about what the "C" might stand for, and while most of them were lewd, one seems like a reasonable fit: Cursor. If the Switch 2 lets users <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-rumored-mouse-functionality-heres-how-it-could-be-used/2900-6247/" data-ref-id="2900-6247">imitate a mouse with the Joy-Con</a>, as Nintendo suggested in the console's reveal trailer, perhaps the "C" button is what tells the Switch 2 to change how it registers Joy-Con inputs.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever it does, we don't have much longer to wait before we find out. Nintendo is hosting another Direct devoted to the Switch 2 and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launching-in-june-with-three-phase-rollout-for-games-report/1100-6530366/" data-ref-id="1100-6530366">game launch plans </a>on April 2, 2025.</p>

                <p>After rumors and leaks floated about a potential collaboration, it's official: Sea of Thieves is bringing the looks of Destiny 2 to the high seas with today's update. Players can deck out their ship and crew with swanky Lightbearer items and gear such as Ghost anchors and sails bearing the signs of either Hunter, Warlock, or Titan. There are even class-themed figureheads, wheels, and a ship's crest, bearing Destiny insignias.</p><p>You can check out the trailer below to see the full Lightbearer assortment, including a Drifter costume and a Whisper of the Worm ornament for the Eye of Reach. Players can visit the <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/pirate-emporium" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pirate Emporium</a> to gear up for battle. Eyes up, mateys.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSG5UbZPxXw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bSG5UbZPxXw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Even though it might not seem like an obvious choice, Destiny's classes and co-operative play presented a 'crew-like' bond that we thought was a great fit, along with some striking iconography, vivid art style and a sense of being mythical in tone and scope," Adam Park, Rare's director of brand and licensing, told <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/27/sea-of-thieves-destiny-cosmetics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox News</a>.</p><p>After an initial deal was made, what would actually be used in the update came down to Andria Warren, director of creative operations at Rare, who oversaw the development and said it was a deeply collaborative process.</p><p>"From the earliest concept sketches to finalizing designs that honored both universes, every step challenged us to think differently," she said. "We explored how iconic Destiny elements could be reimagined through a Sea of Thieves lens, translating tone, visual language, and character into something that felt fresh but unmistakably faithful. It pushed our teams creatively in the best possible way, and the result is something we're truly proud of!"</p><p>To get the Lightbearer Big Bundle, it'll set you back 4999 Ancient Coins--about $50, or $45 with game pass. The weapons bundle, which features four ornaments--including the Ace of Spades--and costs 499 Ancient Coins. Each ship bundle, decorated with Hunter, Warlock, or Titan themes, costs 3499 Ancient Coins. Sails and figureheads are 899, and the Drifter costume is 999.</p>

            <p>
Of all the mysteries still surrounding Switch 2, its rumoured 'C' button is perhaps the most enigmatic. Not least because when Nintendo finally revealed its Switch successor earlier this year, there was a conspicuously blank square where everyone was expecting a 'C' button to be. Now, though, with Switch 2's full reveal just a week away, the 'C' has finally, quietly been confirmed in an official image for the newly announced Nintendo Today mobile app.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a Switch 2 'C' button first emerged prior to Nintendo's official reveal, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">various leaks</a> indicating it would be situated below the 'home' button on the console's right-hand Joy-Con. And a button mostly fitting that description did eventually show up when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2's hardware design was finally unveiled in January</a> - albeit minus the 'C'.
</p>
<p>
But now the 'C' is official. During <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct-march-2025">Nintendo's latest Direct showcase</a>, the company unveiled its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">new calendar-style Nintendo Today news app</a>. And an accompanying App Store and Google Play promotional image just so happened to include a picture of Switch 2 - now with its mysterious Joy-Con button firmly emblazoned with its long-rumoured 'C':
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/switch-2-c.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Of course, confirmation of the 'C' doesn't get us any closer to solving the mystery of what the button actually <em>does</em>. Some have speculated the 'C' is merely a nod to GameCube's 'C' button, itself an evolution of the yellow 'C' buttons on N64. But others have suggested the 'C' stands for more than just the first letter of the alphabet not already taken by other buttons on Switch 2.

<p>
Some, for instance, have reasoned it could stand for 'Cast' if Nintendo was considering some sort of streaming functionality for the console, or perhaps 'Chat' in the event it's planning more robust social features for its Switch successor. There've even been rumours it stands for 'Campus', claimed to be an evolution of Wii U's much-loved Miiverse. Alternatively, it could be a button to activate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Switch 2's leaked mouse functionality</a>, with the 'C' not actually standing for anything at all. Or perhaps it'll summon Fire Emblem's Chrom to have a little wink at you.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the now officially 'C'd button does, all will likely be revealed next week when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2-focused Direct</a> airs. It all kicks off at 2pm next Wednesday, 2nd April, in the UK. And needless to say, Eurogamer will 'C' you there.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-keyboards-are-superior-and-the-reason-i%E2%80%99m-the-writer-i-am-today.1147236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many gearheads out there, I went through a “keyboard phase.” And though I did eventually settle in on a “daily driver,” I never really left that keyboard phase. I am only the writer that I am because the keyboards that you buy at the store simply will not suffice, are not specific and perverted enough to accommodate my aberrant typing. I have grown accustomed to my split keyboard, and my pursuit of perfection led me to DIY hardware, soldering, ordering PCBs, and most of my career writing about open source hardware.</p><p>A split keyboard is, appropriately, a keyboard split into two halves. Often these sides are tethered by a cord, although wireless alternatives do exist. This design is not new; in fact it goes back decades. It fundamentally comes down to ergonomics: Typing is unnatural, and having your arms angled inward with palms faced down to meet a single point doesn’t follow the resting shape of the human body. If the arms can be said to have a natural resting place, it is palms facing inwards or at least angled and shoulder width apart. Most keyboards are not shaped like this.</p><p>The effort to replicate a less stressful typing position has led to many absurd designs, including big U shaped keyboards that have you typing sideways. A good compromise is to split the board in half, and potentially to “tent” it by placing it on a slight angle pointing outward relative to the typing surface (many people settle on 20 to 30 degrees.). Some people go so far as to rig the keyboard under their desk or attached to their chair to better simulate this position. A split keyboard may sound like an unnatural arrangement, but as long as you’re not a hunt and peck typist, your hands behave the same way no matter where they are on your desk. All splitting the keyboard does is put them in a better place.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Tenting stands work at an angle to more clearly follow the natural shape of the hands. Credit: <a href="https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GEIGEIGEIST</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>There are other advantages to a split keyboard, namely splitting the space bar. The space bar is usually not well designed. Your thumbs are very useful, and you do not need to dedicate two thumbs to the task of spacing. Splitting the space bar into two allows you to have two smaller keys to dedicate to different functions, like spacing and something else like return, shift or escape. By making the keys smaller, you also move less mass per stroke than if you were simply moving a single bar. Even if a split keyboard is impractical to you I firmly believe that most keyboards would benefit from the option of having two space keys instead of one. Even many non-split keyboards have a split space.</p><p>Now you may say to yourself, “great, I’m sold, where can I buy one?” The answer is “not at Best Buy or Micro Center.” The split keyboard has long been the domain of the tech pervert, and despite being the ergonomically superior option, the industry is still slow to offer the option at scale. Brands like Kenesis have been the entry level for a very long time, but their boards do not offer custom mapping or the ability to hot swap your keyboard switches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Kinesis has been holding this down for ages but it's always been a specialty product and you will pay a premium for it.  Credit: Kinesis</figcaption></figure><p>Keychron offers the Q11 at more than $200 dollars, which is well above their normal price point. There’s one called the Royal Cludge RKS70 which is hot swappable and has tenting legs but is not remappable. This may be a fun entry point for a lot of people looking to jump in without rocking the boat too much, but I have no interest in it. The company ZSA has several that are ideal, namely the Moonlander, The Voyager, and the Ergodox EZ. These feature a wonderful ergonomic “thumb cluster” and come ready to use. I know several people who love these, but they are also about $350 as of this writing.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody has really nailed a split keyboard at the entry level, which is what pushes many people, myself included, to go custom. The DIY keyboard scene exploded years ago, and although it seems to have calmed down a bit (you only need so many keyboards before it’s “enough”), the work that the community has done has laid the foundation for increasingly elaborate input devices of increasing perversion and complexity. If there is a keyboard that you can dream of, someone has probably already made it and put the files and firmware on the internet for free.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Moonlander is probably the most viable retail option out there that checks all the boxes and doesn't involve soldering or DIY. Credit: <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZSA</a></figcaption></figure><p>A huge part of this work is firmware. That may sound trivial, but making sure that input devices work correctly and also allowing for custom mapping is a gargantuan task. There are several open source keyboard firmware options. QMK and ZMK are probably the most well known, the former being the established player and the latter being newer and more flexible for people trying to make their own custom keyboards. Many keyboards like those from companies like Drop and Keychron come pre-flashed with QMK, and often with a software called Via, although there is a competing option called Vial that many people prefer. The ZMK alternative is <a href="https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZMK Studio</a>. These allow not only for remapping your keyboard, but also for complex keystrokes, macros, and layering.</p><p><strong>Why remap your keyboard? A world without QWERTY</strong></p><figure><figcaption>QWERTY (1870s), Dvorak(1936), and Colemak (2006) layouts via Wikimedia commons.</figcaption></figure><p>“What’s wrong with my keyboard layout?” you may ask. Nothing, technically, although the standard QWERTY layout is an abomination that has really only persisted because of momentum since its invention in the 1800s despite better layouts existing. The most well-known keyboard layout for a long time was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dvorak</a>, which has been around since the 1930s. QWERTY sucks because it’s not ergonomic and there’s no modern rhyme or reason to where the keys are placed; rarely used keys often take up the prime real estate. Ideally a keyboard should place the most frequently used letters on the “home row,” the center row where the fingers naturally rest. Placing frequently used letters in hard to reach places subtly increases the strain of each keystroke, which contributes to overall wear on the user’s joints. An ergonomic layout does an analysis of letter frequency and attempts to keep those close to home.</p><figure><figcaption>Colemak Mod-DH changes some of these rules a little from Colemak, but there are countless other layouts. Credit: <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colemakmods</a>. </figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://colemak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colemak</a> was the true breakthrough of alternative keyboard layouts when it came out in 2006, being both superior to Dvorak and easier to learn for users coming from QWERTY. Since then, many <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W0jhfqJI2ueJ2FNseR4YAFpNfsUM-_FlREHbpNGmC2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative layouts have sprung up, as have subsequent analysis</a>. These various layouts take into account letter frequency as well as different factors like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1doxsor/updated_bigram_and_trigram_tables_on_keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bigrams and trigrams</a>. Despite evolutions in layouts analysis, Colemak is probably the most well known alternative, and the more evolved <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colemak Mod-DH</a> is tried and true and simple to suggest to people. You don’t even need a custom board to do it; there are multiple ways to play around with keyboard layouts on an OS level. There’s plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTFoMVRWenllUE1qRk5mckxmd2hxVVNwMWtoUXxBQ3Jtc0tuRmR0c3M4dnRMWFgtWVRGTVNTa2dma1Ywa0dDNnNadkUtQm5zWWF5YlJmNUhvYXhFRTk0V2tUc3hxMWhkbUJEU0J4QlY5T2w3YmtFckF4em5zZEJfbUdwV004cGFkeUNNck41YVNnRkFhbmZadWhxcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keybr.com%2F&amp;v=DKQ4pOoFh5I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free tools online </a>to <a href="https://monkeytype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help you learn</a> those layouts too. I don’t have a dog in this fight as I have attempted to leave QWERTY so many times with different layouts but have never fully committed. That said, I know that switching to a new layout like the updated version of Colemak is an inevitability for me.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="QWERTY Is the Worst - Here's How to STOP Using It" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKQ4pOoFh5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Ben has a really good channel related to this stuff, also other things like how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnRoO6xhWNM">wash your car correctly</a>. </figcaption></figure></div><p>Even if you decide to stay a QWERTY coward, there are other advantages to remapping your keyboard. Here’s a simple one: taking back the precious real estate stolen by the slovenly caps lock button. Caps lock is the most useless button on the keyboard, made redundant by the humble shift key, and it’s sitting pretty on some of the best real estate on your keyboard, easily accessed by the pinky. Most sane layouts come to this conclusion naturally, and for years the Happy Hacking Keyboard was preferred by coders for this very reason. Most OSes will let you switch that input without even changing your keyboard, and in Windows you can do it on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerToys</a>. It’s one of the first things I did on my MacOS laptop, along with turning the right command and right option to backspace and delete. On top of this there’s also <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karabiner Elements</a> for MacOS, and <a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">katana for cross platform</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important tool at your disposal that custom keyboard firmware allows for is “layering.” Instead of dedicating space on your keyboard to keys that are out of the way, layering allows you to place different keyboard keys and macros on different layers, often accessed by holding a key of your choice down. Often this is a dedicated layer button on the keyboard, but you can also just make it so that your space bar(s) function as raise and lower layer functions when held down. While this sounds complicated in theory, in practice it is very natural with a tiny bit of practice.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The layers on my keyboard. The buttons on the thumb clusters are tab/space/enter on the left and space/backspace/delete on the right. Holding down the outer keys on both sides allow me to shift to layer 1 (middle) and layer 2 (bottom). Layer 3's purpose is mysterious. </figcaption></figure><p>The two most obvious use cases for layering are numbers and the arrow keys. Arrows are crucial to page navigation, but placing them to the right forces you to move your hand every time you wish to navigate. By placing them on an adjacent layer where the JKLI keys usually are, navigation becomes as simple as holding down your space bar. This should be intuitive to anybody who frequently edits video and uses JKL to scrub back and forth, as well as any gamer who has ever navigated a game world with WASD. I cannot stress how much faster this small change makes basic page navigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Numbers and symbols, which normally require reaching up and holding shift, can be placed on not just one row but several. In my case I have numbers on the bottom row of my keyboard on one layer, symbols on the middle row, and function keys on the top row. In addition to this, I also have a numpad on a separate layer, which should excite any numpad sickos who have worked data entry and know how much faster numpads are. Layering could be an article unto itself, and has allowed me to shave the size of my keyboard down more and more as the years have gone by. If you wanna see how deep this rabbit hole actually goes, look into “<a href="https://www.artofchording.com/introduction/how-steno-works.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chording</a>” (pressing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crkbd/comments/us6ucr/chordic_keyboard_layout_for_the_cornecrkbd/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-admin/post-new.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple keys together</a> to represent a single input or syllable), which is how stenography keyboards have traditionally worked, allowing for typing up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nETlhthG22Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">370 words per minute</a>. This behavior is now more accessible than ever thanks to selflessly-made open source hardware and firmware.</p><figure><figcaption>The <a href="https://github.com/kbjunky/Chordie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chordie</a> is an open source chorded keyboard based on the <a href="https://asetniop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASETNIOP layou</a>t.

Bless the Corne. Credit: foostan</figcaption></figure><p>We live in a better world for typing than we did years ago, in part because companies have embraced open source, mappable keyboards as a viable commercial option. But when I started down this long path, DIY was the only game in town I could afford. My first custom keyboard was the <a href="https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sofle</a>, which featured not only a thumb cluster but also rotary encoders for scrolling. The Sofle was a variation on the <a href="https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lily58</a>, which itself owes a lot to the most popular open source keyboard in history: <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Corne</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Corne is a 40% (no numbers or function keys) split keyboard, and no discussion of this topic would be complete without giving that board and its designer Kosuke Adachi, aka Foostan, their flowers. Originally based off of the ortholinear <a href="https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helix</a>, the Corne features a “staggered” layout, meaning that the keys more aggressively follow the differing lengths of the finger. It’s open source and easy to build, and if you know how to order circuit boards from China there is no shortage of tutorials on how to do this. Because of its open nature, it has allowed countless modifications and variations to be built. God bless the Corne; many of us would not be here today without it.</p><figure><figcaption>Some options from top left clockwise: The Kyria, the GEIST TOTEM, the Dilemma MAX and the ximi v2. Credit SplitKB, KeebSupply, BastardKB, Fingerpunch.</figcaption></figure><p>When I bought my Sofle I had not yet taught myself how to solder, so I relied on the work of a custom keyboard builder I found on reddit to do the job at a fairly reasonable price. These days, the options are varied depending on what you want and what your price is. There are <a href="https://yal-tools.github.io/ergo-keyboards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more split keyboards than you can summarize</a>. You have vendors <a href="https://splitkb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SplitKB</a>, who have sold the beautiful Kyria. Keebsupply is a vendor for the <a href="https://keeb.supply/products/geist-totem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GEIST TOTEM</a>, which is a lovely low-profile staggered board with just enough keys. <a href="https://bastardkb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BastardKB</a> sells several “dactyl” based keyboards – custom u shaped boards meant to fit your hand more aggressively –as well as the Dilemma, a design which features a trackpad. <a href="https://fingerpunch.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fingerpunch </a>is a good vendor with a very inviting Discord. You can also go the Etsy route – tons of keyboard vendors are on there. No matter what you buy, just make sure you know if you’re getting a kit that requires soldering or a whole keyboard, because the latter is always going to be more expensive.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>My entry point: the Sofle.</figcaption></figure><p>But since many of these boards are open source and the designs are on Github, you can do what I have done multiple times: download the files and have a PCB manufacturer like JLCPCB, PCBWay or OSH Park print the PCBS out and mail them to you. The raw parts and PCBs to make a keyboard are dirt cheap. This is unquestionably the most labor intensive way to do this, and you will have to be proficient in soldering and learn how to flash firmware onto your keyboard. But once you’ve built one split keyboard the process is kind of similar for all of them, and the GitHub repositories of most of these boards also include extensive tutorials.</p><p>Getting your own boards made also lets you import art into the open source circuit software KiCAD and doodle on your PCBs, which I have done many times. My current board is called a Nijuni: a modification of a Jorne, itself a spiritual successor to the Corne. I had those printed out, vandalized them to have <em>Pop Team Epic</em> art on it, and have never looked back. I have even experimented with wireless options, which is now far easier than you would expect as you can get microcontrollers with bluetooth on aliexpress for like five bucks these days, which is great even if you decide not to go that route and buy extra in the event of potential duds.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I actually have some other keyboards I need to make on top of this. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Switches</strong></p><figure><figcaption>The parts of a switch from <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/parts-of-a-mechanical-keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Das Keyboard's very good guide on the topic</a>. Das makes very high quality boards if you aren't a split keyboard pervert. Credit: Das Keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p>If you are making a keyboard from scratch or modifying an existing one, you can spend a lot of time on your keycaps and your switches. People obsess over this to an almost unhealthy degree, but I will try to simplify and summarize the key points here quickly. Most mechanical keyboards (i.e.,&nbsp; the good kind that don’t use those cheap rubber dome switches) that are not low profile use Cherry MX style key switches, a weird little cube that turns the stroke from the keycap into an input. These are generally sorted into linear, tactile and clicky switches. Linear just go down with no tactile resistance, tactile have a little bump in them, and clicky switches are loud, satisfying, and will make any coworker, roommate or spouse in audible range want to cave your skull in with an axe handle.&nbsp;</p><p>I generally prefer tactile switches in the style of Cherry MX Browns, although most keyboard snobs now will tell you the original Cherry Brown switches kinda suck. My sweet spot is about 45 to 55 grams of force depending on the switch. There are more switches like this than there are stars in the sky, and the ones in my keyboard were made by a company that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1fwzrym/thekeycompany_closing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went out of business five months</a> ago. A lot of people seem to like the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-invyr-holy-panda-mechanical-switches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holy Panda </a>switches, and nothing sounds quite like the Gazzew Boba U4T, which I have used and <a href="https://www.rtings.com/keyboard-switch/reviews/best/switches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which RTings loves</a>. Keyswitches can also be modified, and all of mine have been “spring swapped” using <a href="https://ringerkeys.com/products/gazzew-springs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">55 gram switches from Gazzew</a>. This is done by taking each individual key switch and disassembling it using a key switch opener (these are very cheap) and putting a new spring in. While you are in there, applying a small bit of aftermarket lubrication is a great way to make the switch feel fantastic. <a href="https://divinikey.com/products/205-grade-0-switch-lubricant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I use 205G0</a> on mine.</p><p><strong>Caps</strong></p><figure><figcaption>DES is my current favorite layout. Note how the caps curve. Credit: <a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/des-alpha-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asymplex.xyz</a></figcaption></figure><p>Keycaps are a deep rabbit hole unto itself, and everyone feels differently about them. There are multiple kinds of plastic you can use, but ABS and PBT are the most common. For years I used a Leopold keyboard, and those use thick, beautiful chalky PBT caps with a specific profile that l had grown accustomed to. When I got my Sofle I went so far as to buy some secondhand Leopold caps that a guy on reddit didn’t need any more. Even outside of keycaps specifically, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/mechmarket</a> remains a great place to buy and sell old keyboards and parts that people don’t use any more. There are many different keyboard “profiles,” different shapes that conform to fit the curve of your fingertips. You can’t go wrong with the standard Cherry profile, although it’s been a minute since I have bought keycaps so I don’t know what the meta is anymore.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/des-alpha-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>A Corne using the DES layout.

Pseudoku actually <a href="https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open sourced much of the design</a>, and so for the main three rows I actually had the keycaps printed in PA12 Nylon, a kind of nylon that you need a very expensive kind of 3D printer to make but which is fairly inexpensive to do in small quantities. Someone sells those on Etsy if memory serves, but if you need a lot of keycaps there’s nothing stopping you from doing it yourself. Pseudoku’s are made out of porcelain and resin and feel tremendously nice. They kind of feel like you’re typing on teeth in a good way. An alternative if you want this pervert lifestyle is the fairly new KLP Lame, a recent addition to the open source keycap world that has both <a href="https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">choc (low profile) and MX (regular)</a> variants.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>KLP Lamé, a brand new profile that shares certain elements of DES.

You should be able to walk into a Micro Center and just buy a pre-assembled Corne, or something like it, for 100 bucks or less. I must also acknowledge that the lack of options from big companies made me hungry, restless, and a more interesting writer. The first real soldering projects I had were about keyboards. It’s the thing that taught me exactly how to order PCBs from China, and led me to realize that many of the parts in my electronics can just be ordered directly from aliexpress.&nbsp;</p><p>Because no keyboard fully satisfied me for so long, I was forced to make my own, and in the process the nature of the keyboard became demystified. It is the wellspring from which all of my DIY electronic interests have emerged, because so many other things follow once you modify or assemble a keyboard: <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-need-an-open-source-mouse-so-i-never-have-to-look-at-razer-synapse-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mice</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VCRs</a>, LED lighting, custom hitboxes, <a href="https://aftermath.site/diy-speaker-pioneer-dennis-murphy-andrew-jones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaker modifications</a>. The mechanical keyboard boom has subsided, but what remains is a more interesting world of DIY tech and increasingly elaborate split keyboards. If that sounds interesting to you, think about trying or maybe even building one, because it could potentially lead you to places you never imagined.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future"><h3>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For</h3></a><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications"><h3>Social Media Has Me Ducking My Friends And It Sucks</h3></a><p>We were never meant to have this much always-on access to each other</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
