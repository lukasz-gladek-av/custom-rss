            <p>
Friendslop games may come and go, but the (for all intents and purposes) progenitor of them all, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is still the one I think of most. It's scary, it's funny, it's otherworldly, literally, there's so much mystery to it that you just want to spend time in its world. But while it will likely go down as solo dev Zeekerss' most notable work, he did just release a brand new horror game 10 years in the making. And in a recent interview, he spoke of how he got his start in horror, and the roots that make up his latest work.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/i-dont-know-why-but-it-feels-like-fear-has-been-my-primary-emotion-ever-since-i-was-a-kid-lethal-company-creator-says-horror-games-still-feel-like-home-as-his-10-year-project-finally-ends/">GamesRadar</a>, Zeekerss noted that he "didn't start by making horror games, but I found my home in this genre. I don't know why, but it feels like fear has been my primary emotion ever since I was a kid. But it's a deeper thing; the emotional spectrum of fear and courage, hope and despair, is my way of interpreting the world. As an artist, it's my first language. I can branch out to other genres, but they'll always find their context in that."
</p>
<p>
You can really feel that even within Lethal Company. It's a horror game, sure, but through play it becomes a comedy, a drama, a tragedy, it's capable of a lot more than just scares. When it comes to his latest game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/welcome-to-the-dark-place">Welcome To The Dark Place</a>, Zeekerss speaks of a pretty broad influence too, citing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a> and its magical realism. "That game does this thing where it dives into dizzying, text-based 'rabbit holes' in which you tell yourself the story," he said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a> from No Code (now Screen Burn, currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>) served as inspiration too, but the big one is the classic text-based adventure game Zork. "When I was a kid, maybe 10 years old, somebody loaded up Zork on the family computer and let me loose. I remember feeling like it was the most realistic and mysterious game I had ever played," Zeekerss explained.
</p><p>
I'm sure a burning question you might have is "how the hell did a text-based game take 10 years to make?" Well, the answer is good old fashioned scope creep. With text being infinitely easier to implement than 3D models or environments, as Zeekerss puts it, "As soon as I think of something, it can be playable." But because of that, it kind of got out of control, something he described as, at times, "maddening."
</p>
<p>
In the years since starting it, games like Lethal Company and his other works like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-steals">It Steals</a> and Dead Seater obviously got in the way too. But Zeekerss continues to be an interesting developer because of the fact he doesn't pin himself down to one type of game, even if horror is something he'll always come back to.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and, if you didn't know, Welcome To The Dark Place is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135700/Welcome_To_The_Dark_Place/">free on Steam</a>, so even if we're a few days past Halloween now, you've not got many excuses not to try it out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mlb-slugfest-2003">Remember<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a>? If you do remember this over-the-top PS2-era baseball game, it’s likely because of its often funny color commentators, Tim and Jimmy, who offered up bizarre or crude jokes and stories between hits. And it turns out that some of the duo’s lines went a bit too far for the MLB 20 years ago.</p> <p>Published by Midway Sports in 2002 for PS2, Xbox, and GameCube, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ngx93LcdCyI"><em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a> was an arcade-y baseball game heavily inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/come-to-think-of-it-the-original-nfl-blitz-did-have-a-5911734">Midway’s popular <em>NFL Blitz</em> series</a>. Like <em>Blitz</em>, <em>Slugfest 2003</em> added a lot of chaos, violence, and humor into the classic sport in a way that I can’t imagine Major League Baseball would be okay with in 2025. But even back in the early 2000s, the MLB wasn’t on board for <em>all</em> of Midway’s naughty jokes and dark commentary bits. Now, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-retro-classic-virtual-console-piracy-vghf-hist-1848558311">Video Game History Foundation</a>, we can hear which jokes crossed the line with MLB execs.</p>

 <p>On November 3, the VGHF posted a video on social media sharing some of the group’s favorite cut commentary jokes from<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em>. The VGHF, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving and sharing video game history, says these cut lines, as well as some documents related to<em> MLB Slugfest’</em>s unused jokes, were discovered in the group’s archives on a CD.</p>   <p>Over on the VGHF’s archives, <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/item/c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8">you can find a document seemingly sent over to Midway</a>, presumably from the MLB, listing <a href="https://us.preservica.com/Render/render/external?entityRef=c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8&amp;token=17e03a1a-f2fc-42e4-a85e-9a8af97d201a">all the jokes</a> that were “disapproved” for use in the finished game. Some of these jokes are bad, and I totally support the MLB for asking for them to be cut. But some of the cut jokes don’t seem too bad. For example, this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Baseball’s the greatest sport in the world, but one thing I liked growing up was taking a pop bottle and breaking it with a rock.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s just funny. But perhaps my favorite cut line that is, admittedly a bit dark, is this one:</p> <blockquote><p>“Jimmy: Tim, have you ever wondered if this booth could just collapse and kill the both of us?”</p> <p>“Tim: Jimmy, it’s all I think about.”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, you can check out all the cut lines and more from <em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em> over on the VGHF’s fantastic publicly accessible digital library and archive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vghf-old-retro-game-magazines-read-online-free-library-1851751951">which also contains over 1,500 video game magazines</a> that can be accessed for free. <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">Though I recommend kicking over a few bucks to VGHF if you can, as the group is doing the work that publishers won’t</a> and that’s worth supporting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fans of several of EA’s franchises are worried about what might happen to their favorite games and series now that the publisher and all its subsidiaries are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"><span>being acquired</span></a><span> by some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849"><span>worst people and forces you could possibly imagine</span></a><span>. The Saudi Arabian government and Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are buying out the company behind games like </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, BioWare’s catalog, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189"><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i></a><span>, all of which are known and celebrated for their queer characters and storylines. Fans are so worried about what might happen to these games and their inclusive design moving forward that </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>content creators have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-4-youtubers-pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-2000638834"><span>opted out of the series’ creator program</span></a><span> over the acquisition. With so much uncertainty lingering over the company right now, fans can’t help but wonder what franchises like </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>might look like after all the papers are signed. One of the original leads on the game says that if </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>were to abandon the queer community, it would lose the heart and soul of what has made the life sim series so popular since its debut in 2000.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/the-sims-designer-says-that-the-series-diversity-is-critical-especially-at-times-like-now/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, original </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sims 2</span></i><span> artist and director Charles London explained that representing same-sex relationships is “incredibly important” to the spirit of the franchise.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s everything,” London told </span><i><span>FRVR</span></i><span>, “and I think it’s existential for the business, right? It is certainly for society. I think it’s incredibly important for there to be a mainstream, beloved brand that says ‘love is love and people are people’ and all the things that I certainly personally believe in, but also I believe it is existential to that business because it is what allows it to be universally appealing, right? Young, old, male, female, gay, straight, other, right? American, Iranian, whatever.</span></p> <p><span>“Its appeal and its recognition of the fundamental truths of our humanity is what creates the empathetic and emotional connection to that game that makes it so powerful,” he continued. “It’s not that there’s so many pants you can dress them in. Don’t get me wrong, that’s an important part of the business, right? That’s also existential… but it’s very connected to evergreen toys like Barbie.”</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, London says that the choice to put same-sex relationships in those early games wasn’t even meant to be the act of a “band of fearless social revolutionaries,” but was merely seen as a reflection of the human experience the team sought to emulate in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, without which the game would have been telling a “lie.”</span></p> <p><span>“I think it goes beyond the sexual,” London said. “The answer I gave actually is applicable to, I think, as many of the decisions we could have possibly made in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> where we are agnostic and where we leave room for player choice. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> must remain [agnostic] for it to be successful, it must remain a faithful canvas on which the player is free to project the story that, to them, is important and emotionally impactful.</span></p> <p><span>“And that includes not just sexuality, it includes body image, it includes race, and it includes the choice of clothing. It includes the choice of architecture, the choice of job, structure, all the magnificent diversity of actual human life, and this is something that the team, I think, deeply understands.”</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, EA asserts that its “values and [its] commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged,” but given the pending new ownership, fans are skeptical. The Saudi Arabian government has made several attempts to latch onto the video game industry in an attempt at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>“sportswashing” the dire state of its human rights laws</span></a><span>, which include the criminalization of same-sex acts, marriage, and cross-dressing. If someone in a position of power at EA says that developers are no longer allowed to implement queer characters and storylines, there’s no guarantee that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>or a future </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>project will include them in the future. Hopefully, someone at EA hears what London is saying and fights back against any such regulation. It would be a real fucking shame if these series with storied queer history weren’t allowed to maintain it in the future.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-confusing-driver-release-amd-says-old-gpus-are-still-actively-supported.1342678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The release notes for the 25.10.2 Adrenalin release also dropped Windows 10 from the list of “compatible operating systems,” listing only Windows 11 21H2 and later. But AMD <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/31/amd-confirms-its-not-ending-windows-10-support-says-windows-11-installer-will-work-on-windows-10/">confirmed</a> to Windows Latest that the driver packages would still support Windows 10 for the foreseeable future. The company said that the OS is not listed in the release notes because Microsoft has technically ended support for Windows 10, but home users running Windows 10 on their PCs can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths/">get an extra year of security patches</a> relatively easily. Microsoft will continue to provide support for the OS in businesses, schools, and other large organizations <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/post-2025-windows-10-updates-for-businesses-start-at-61-per-pc-go-up-from-there/">until at least 2028</a>.</p>
<h2>Why all the fuss?</h2>
<p>It would look bad if AMD dropped or reduced support for those Radeon 5000- and 6000-series GPUs, given that Nvidia continues to support GeForce RTX 20- and 30-series graphics cards launched in the same 2019 to 2022 time window. But the end of support could have been even worse for gaming handhelds and lower-end PCs with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>The RDNA 2 architecture, in particular, has enjoyed a long and ongoing life as an integrated GPU, including for systems that are explicitly marketed and sold as gaming PCs. And because so many of AMD and Intel’s lower-end chips are just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/amd-shores-up-its-budget-laptop-cpus-by-renaming-more-years-old-silicon/">rebranded versions of older silicon</a>, AMD continues to launch “new” products with RDNA 2 GPUs. The RDNA 2 architecture is the one Valve has used in the Steam Deck since 2022, for example, but Microsoft and Asus’ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">just-launched</a> ROG Xbox Ally series <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z2-series/z2-a.html">also includes an RDNA 2 GPU</a> in the entry-level model.</p>
<p>The last time AMD formally scaled back its GPU driver support was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>, when it moved drivers for its Polaris and Vega GPU architectures into a separate package that would only get occasional “critical updates.” At the time, AMD had launched its last dedicated Vega-based GPU just four years before, and many lower-end desktop and laptop processors still shipped with Vega-based integrated GPUs.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck and other SteamOS and Linux systems, at least, it seems that things aren’t really changing, no matter what happens with the Windows drivers. Phoronix <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Windows-RX-5000-6000-Game">points out</a> that the Linux driver package for AMD’s GPUs has always been maintained separately from the Windows drivers and that GPU architectures considerably older than RDNA 1 continue to get official support and occasional improvements.</p>

<p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a361ff1-c666-4fd4-820d-bcc100274c63" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-guide-beginner-tips-and-tricks" rel="nofollow">first few days</a> are pretty dodgy; you have enough money to build <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7505bb65-ecba-4be8-871f-b3baed27fc8b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-building-guide-how-to-build-tavern" rel="nofollow">the bare necessities of a tavern</a> and hire a single <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6dca68a7-2bd6-4c3a-b296-bb14d4fbde37" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-employees" rel="nofollow">employee</a>. If you manage your money well, you'll make a small but steady profit each day. That money, in turn, can be reinvested into expanding your tavern, buying new stock and equipment, and hiring more employees.</p>

<p>There's more to&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;than just managing your money, though. Just like real-world eateries, your tavern has a star rating. A higher star rating will unlock new rooms (such as the Kitchen) and new furniture items, allowing you to provide more services to your customers.</p>

<p>You'll need this new gear, too — a higher star rating also brings more customers and higher tiers of customers. More customers means you'll have to build more tables, hire more employees, and increase the variety and amount of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcfa5593-cf14-4808-ae43-cdd162559c0b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-cooking-and-drinks" rel="nofollow">food and drink</a> you have available.</p>

<p>Stars serve as the objectives in freeplay, but the scenarios will have different objectives altogether, along with some special mechanics. Successfully complete all of the objectives, and you'll be able to move on to managing a much larger tavern in another region.</p>

<p>Riverbottom effectively serves as the tutorial for&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Even if you opt out of the guided tutorial, you're only scratching the surface of what you can do in&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Your next stop is <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="462d4cbc-647d-4d03-9d79-9c56dd1ccbd3" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-harvest-festival-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">Halfington</a>, the homeland of the halflings — and your new tavern which had mysteriously burned down before your arrival.</p>

<p>Halflington gives you much more space to work with, but it also comes with some restrictions: unmovable indoor walls shape and restrict the internal structure of your tavern. This somewhat limits your building layout, but you can work around it (and even use the internal walls to your advantage) if you're creative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The optional challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second scenario also introduces new optical objectives called "challenges." Based on my experience with Halfington and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6c56b2aa-2705-4868-92d2-af5ad31bb949" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-orcish-ambitions-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">the third scenario in Gugamush</a>, these challenges require you to use a specialized scenario if you want to complete them.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="337e3a62-d7b4-4915-89a5-62492adc8779" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-best-in-show-challenge" rel="nofollow">Halfington's "Best in Show" challenge</a>, for example, requires you to win a best guild competition by earning votes from groups of customers. Groups can arrive at any time of day, so your best strategy is to have your tavern open 24 hours a day. That means you'll need double the staff of a normal tavern.</p>

<p>As for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c92d8b66-c380-48a1-9e40-aed856226284" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-accountant-challenge" rel="nofollow">Gugamush's "Accountant" challenge</a>, you must not take any loans whatsoever. This is complicated by the fact that your first employee asks you to give him back pay for the time he spent working in the tavern while it was abandoned. Both of these challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>

<p>There's more to running a tavern than simply hiring employees and keeping the storeroom filled with booze, mind — you have to actually build the tavern. This is an area where&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;diverges from some other games in this vague genre of business simulation: each scenario has a fixed tavern layout.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, the Halfington scenario has these positively annoying supporting walls running through parts of the tavern. The Gugamush scenario has its own strange quirk; the center of your tavern counts as an outdoor area. Gugamush's central courtyard breaks up the floor plan of your tavern, but it does give you a handy spot for an outhouse.</p>

<p>This is one of my bigger pain points with&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. I enjoy having room to lay things out with few obstructions, but it can be challenging to get everything set up just right, and you'll often have to make compromises with your tavern design.</p>

<p>The difficulties of laying out your tavern are exacerbated by the need to provide light and control temperatures. All light sources shoot out embers in a particular radius, and having furniture too close to these lighting sources massively increases your risk of a fire. The same applies to stoves and hearths which are needed to warm up colder maps.</p>

<p>In effect, actually building out your tavern is a balancing act between furniture placement, lighting, and heat (or cooling). You also have to consider pathfinding; you don't want to have too large a distance between your bar, kitchen, and storeroom; customers actually have a patience meter, and it's bad if they aren't served quickly.</p>

<p>Lest we forget, there's a little more to running a tavern than building the place and hiring employees; you'll also need food and drink to serve them. Keeping a steady supply of goods in your storeroom is a little more challenging than you might think at first glance.</p>

<p>Anything you'd want to serve to your customers has to be delivered from breweries and markets. The brewery in Halfington, for example, takes around 14 hours to deliver an order (unless you choose fast shipping, which costs more); there are similar time constraints for food markets, and these delivery times increase if the market is far away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means in practical terms is that you'll usually have to order your food and drink a few hours before opening or the night before. Extreme cases such as the market in Gugamush or distant markets in other regions might have delivery times of 24 hours or longer.</p>

<p>Finally — and perhaps most importantly — customers of different races have different tastes. Orcs prefer one type of food and drink, and halfings prefer something else altogether. Having something is better than nothing in a pinch, but supplying customers with their favored food and drink does wonders for your tavern's ratings.</p>

<p>I love this mechanic — there are many games in this subgenre that don't put this much thought into the food and drink you're serving. What I didn't like, however, was that it wasn't explained as well as it could have been.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of 120 hours exploring&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. While it has its rough edges here and there, I had a lot of fun trying to work out the best way to complete the objectives and playing with a tavern in free play.</p>

<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em> has a solid amount of content for an Early Access launch with 1 tutorial scenario and 2 full scenarios with optional objectives; you can also freeplay the maps with variant layouts or customized rulesets if you so choose. If you enjoy this genre, you'll easily have 40+ hours of content to play at the Early Access launch.</p>

<p>As with all Early Access games, though, the value proposition of&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;depends on how quickly they can get content updates out the door.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a rock-solid foundation and great game mechanics, so here's hoping we won't have to wait too long to play some more.</p>

                <p>Fantastic Pixel Castle, the NetEase-owned MMO studio founded by former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> lead system designer Greg Street, will shut down November 17.</p><p dir="ltr">Street announced the studio's closure date in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. In weeks prior, Street stated NetEase had pulled funding from the studio but had allowed it time to seek out a new publisher or raise funding for their fledgling MMORPG, project Ghost.</p><p dir="ltr">Those efforts have not panned out. Street said "there is still a chance" the studio could secure needed funding and live on, but that it will also depend on how much of the current team will choose to remain should that happen.</p><p dir="ltr">"While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there," Street said.</p><p dir="ltr">Fantastic Pixel Castle had recently hosted a number of content creators to stream a first public look at project Ghost gameplay.

As for how Ghost would have played, it was a class-based MMORPG that was divided into two different experiences called Red and Blue Shards. Blue Shard areas would have played more like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/" data-ref-id="2900-7150">survival game</a>, where friends could party up to gather resources, build bases, and adventure together. Red Shards featured more classic MMORPG experiences, where large groups of players could team together to fight world bosses or impact the game's world in permanent ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Before forming Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street served at Blizzard as a lead systems designer on WoW for nearly six years, later joining Riot Games. There he held a number of different roles, the last of which was overseeing Riot's first MMO. He left Riot in 2023, and about a year later Riot announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-hits-reset-on-league-of-legends-mmo-with-no-news-for-years-to-come/1100-6522053/" data-ref-id="1100-6522053">hitting reset on its League of Legends MMO</a>, going back to the drawing board after several years of development.</p><p dir="ltr">Fantastic Pixel Castle's closure is just the latest in a long line of layoffs and studio shutterings in 2025, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">major layoffs at Xbox</a>.

EA disclosed these as per usual, but a new risk this time around is specific to its pending sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p><p>Specific to the merger, EA said "uncertainty about the effect of the merger may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers, financial counterparties, and others to seek to change existing business relationships with us."</p><p>When the PIF emerged as the leading investor in the consortium to buy EA, one of the first reactions pertained to Saudi Arabia's history of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">human rights violations. </a> Some of the teams inside EA, including BioWare and Maxis, are known for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eas-55-billion-saudi-buyout-good-bad-ugly-rhys-elliott-p9lse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics predicted</a> some staff will leave EA voluntarily due to Saudi Arabia's history with human rights issues.

The $55 billion sale is the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) in history for any industry, and EA is on the hook for $20 billion. The company is expected to use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments, and many fear layoffs and closures could come as well.</p><p>EA's 10-Q filing does not mention humanitarian issues by name, instead referring only to more open-ended "uncertainty" pertaining to a possible negative effect of attracting, retaining, and hiring talent if the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity close the deal to buy EA.</p><h2><strong>EA claims it will retain "creative control"</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> also noticed that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA filed an updated Schedule 14A proxy statement</a> that discusses what impact a sale to the investor consortium could have on EA's culture. The document makes the claim that EA's "mission, values, and commitment to players and fans around the world" would be "unchanged."</p><p>The filing also states that the investor consortium is "supportive and committed to" investing in EA's employees and its "strong culture." Additionally, the document states that EA, not the investor consortium, will "maintain creative control" of the company going forward, adding that EA's "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><h2><strong>Other risks related to the merger</strong></h2><p>Some of the other "merger risks" that EA laid out in its filing included EA's possible inability to pursue other business deals that could be advantageous due to the $55 billion sale being underway. </p><p>EA also mentioned that it has already, and will continue to, incur "significant costs" and expenses for fees and professional services related to the pending buyout. If the deal doesn't close, EA would still be on the hook for these payments, and potentially up to $1 billion in a termination fee to the consortium.</p><p>What's more, EA said the deal could take longer than expected to close, it might face lawsuits from the board of directors about it, and public stockholders may raise concerns.</p><p>These risks are separate from the "strategic risks" that EA disclosed in the 10-Q as well. Some of these risks include EA deriving a "significant portion" of its revenue from a "few" franchises. EA mentioned the EA Sports FC series as an example here, saying the annual franchise brings in lots of money each year, and if something happened that would impact this--like a delay or cancellation, loss of a license, or bad reviews--that could be problematic. Another risk is an outside contracted developer failing to meet contractural expectations, or if a new console comes out and fails to find a big audience, EA said.</p><h2><strong>Hurricanes, earthquakes, and tariffs</strong></h2><p>There are a series of "operational risks" highlighted in the document as well, including natural disasters. EA noted that its corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California is near a fault line and some of its other offices, like in Los Angeles and Orlando, are "vulnerable to natural disasters and weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes." EA also noted that a major weather event could interrupt the power grid, which could negatively affect EA's ability to do business.</p><p>Additionally, EA called out US President Donald Trump's much-criticized tariff and immigration policies as possible risks to its business. "Relations between the United States and countries in which we have operations and sales have been impacted by events such as immigration policies and the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including tariffs and economic sanctions, that may have a material impact on our operations and financial results," EA said.</p><p>"For example, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on imported goods and any retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments could result in increased costs and uncertainty that may negatively affect global economic conditions and activity and negatively affect our business and the businesses of our partners."</p><p>EA's sale to the investor consortium is expected to close in 2026. Some experts believe the deal may face a smoother regulatory process due in part to Affinity Partners boss Jared Kushner being the son-in-law of Trump.

<p>Sega Sammy has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/ir_2025_web_all_low_en_.pdf">published its latest business report</a> (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/persona-5-series-sales-october-2025/">Persona Central</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/persona-5-games-wont-stop-selling-series-tops-13-million-sales">Push Square</a>), and the Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million units since its debut in 2016. That's up from 10 million back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/the-persona-5-series-has-shifted-over-10-million-copies-worldwide">December 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Series, you ask? Well, that includes the original PS3/4 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/persona_5_dancing_in_starlight">Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</a>. <strong>Persona 5: The Phantom X</strong>, the mobile game, was not developed by Atlus and is not included.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nZnuGRwfwx0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnZnuGRwfwx0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8f0vgzjxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://p-ch.jp/news/20511/">Atlus JP announced</a> that Persona 5 and Personal 5 Royal had sold over 10 million copies alone, making up the huge bulk of that 13k figure, unsurprisingly.</p>

<p>Talking about the growth in repeat sales (for all of Sega's series), Sega says that "In recent years, games have tended to enjoy longer sales lifecycles, and with the growing share of digital downloads, sales of repeat titles have increased accordingly."</p>
<p>In terms of other Persona games that are available on Switch (or Switch 2), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> now sits at 2.07 million sales, though these figures are based on sales prior to the Switch 2 version's release.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>are</em> getting a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a>, though that doesn't appear to be Nintendo bound at the moment. We'll have to wait and see if we'll get to see it on Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-claims-it-will-%E2%80%9Cmaintain-creative-control%E2%80%9D-if-its-55-billion-buyout-by-saudi-arabia-pif-and-silver-lake-goes-through.1342594/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the final week of September, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">a report from The Wall Street Journal claimed</a> that Electronic Arts (EA) was going private in a massive $50 billion buyout, with the major investors being Silver Lake, a private equity company run by Jared Kushner, and the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), among others. A few days later, the news would be confirmed, with EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">officially announcing it had agreed to be acquired by this 'Consortium' of investors for $55 billion</a>, and the video game industry has had endless questions ever since.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">Questions about the $20 billion of debt</a> that EA takes on with this deal, and what impact that will have on EA's future. Questions about whether EA will be able to continue making the kinds of games it makes now under its new ownership, and if the developers making those games will still be the ones who get to say what goes into those games and what doesn't. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">In an updated version of its FAQ</a> about the deal for EA employees (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners">Game File</a>), it seems like EA has tried to answer that question.</p>



<p>Under the question, "<em>Will our culture change as a result of this deal?</em>" a new line has been added which claims that "<em>EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact</em>."</p>



<p>Additionally, under the question "<em>What influence will these stockholders have on creative or business decisions?</em>" EA claims "<em>The Consortium believes in our vision, our leadership and our focus on creating games, stories, and content that reflect a range of experiences and delivering them to our global player community. They're investing in the creativity that defines EA</em>."</p>



<p>If this deal goes through, we'll see where these claims stand once we've seen EA release a game under its new ownership. Of course, there's the chance that these claims remain true, and that none of the new owners will try to influence creative control over EA titles. Or, we could see a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">similar situation to Fatal Fury adding Cristiano Ronaldo to the game</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, another element of the FAQ goes against a report from last week. Under the question, "<em>Will our approach to AI change under new ownership?</em>" an answer line reads, "<em>We will maintain a thoughtful, steady approach to AI. AI is a tool to empower our people to put creativity first by reimagining workflows and amplifying the creative power of our teams</em>."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> report, which quotes several current EA employees, does not describe EA's approach to AI as "<em>steady</em>" or "<em>thoughtful</em>," but rather that EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">is pushing AI on its employees in every task</a>, with tools meant to produce code in particular, causing a mountain of issues that then need to be fixed manually.</p>



<p>That said, workflows going from what they used to be, i.e. a programmer writing code, doing their best to make no mistakes, to having an AI tool write hundreds of lines of code without any care for the quality of it that then has to be fixed manually, does count as workflows being "<em>reimagined</em>" by AI if you think about it.</p>

              <p>I’ve never played an isometric RPG that didn’t feel better with turn-based combat, so it’s really neat to hear <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-exploit-update-obsidian-pillars-eternity-2-removed-steam-2000631633">that <em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> will be testing the more tactical option in the weeks ahead. It’ll hopefully be more intuitive for some players than the game’s existing “real-time with pause” combat, and get more people to check out where Obsidian Entertainment’s big fantasy series got its start.</p> <p>Testing on the new mode will begin November 5 for the PC version of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with plans to add it in a future patch. Game director Josh Sawyer called it a big undertaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8">in a video blog</a> announcing the update, and said it was inspired by the positive reception to the addition of turn-based combat in <em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-is-getting-a-turn-based-mode-1831961398">back in 2019</a>. That said, fans had criticism of the system which Sawyer said will be addressed for the version coming to the original <em>Pillars</em>.</p> <p>“One of the major changes is that action economy is a lot more accurate to the real-time with pause game,” he said. “It’s not a one-to-one translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real-time with pause mode.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action">To keep combat from feeling slow, lethality has been buffed so that fights aren’t super drawn out. Obsidian is also looking at a HUD toggle to let players swap combat modes on the fly, but there will be an option in the game settings menu that players can change at will either way. Fans are taking the news well and already demanding a sequel. “Please give this man the budget of <em>BG3</em> to make the next <em>Pillars</em>,” one wrote on YouTube.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> might be an older game at this point but its universe is one that keeps getting carried forward, most recently with 2025’s great <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">first-person action-RPG <em>Avowed</em></a>. The turn-based mode will make it easier for players to revisit where the fantasy world of Eora got its start. It would be nice if it eventually comes to the console version of the game as well.</p>

              <p>Following some disruptive server issues after <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend was slammed with an influx of players, Embark Studios is giving out 500 Raider Tokens to those who played on Sunday, which translates to about five bucks in real, U.S. dollars. It’s a nice gesture, but as many in the growing <i>Arc Raiders</i> community have pointed out, five bucks ain’t gonna get you a whole lot in the in-game shop.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate your patience as our servers had a wobble on Sunday, Scrappy must've pecked a few wires loose, he's been put on the naughty step 🐓<br>As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday.</p> <p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1985381493829443634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers were <i>packed</i> this weekend. Hitting over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone has helped land the extraction shooter in the top five most-played games on Valve’s storefront, putting it just under <i>Battlefield 6</i>. The game is winning over an eager fanbase with its engaging progression systems and hardcore gameplay loop. But <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ in-game cosmetic shop is a sore spot for many, especially given that the game requires a $40 purchase to play.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">How The Hell Did We Let $20 Skins Become A Thing?</a></p> <p>“I thought $10 worth of coins would be enough to buy [a particular] skin, not the bundle, just the skin,” a Redditor writes in a post titled “The prices are…a little spicy, right?” Whether you’re playing <i>Fortnite </i>or <i>Diablo IV </i>or any number of other games, it’s become all too common to see high price tags affixed to the privilege of sporting a new digital look.</p>

   <p>But to many <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ fans, it’s not just the price, but the lack of customization options with the pricey cosmetics that’s getting under their skin. For now, while you can mix up different backpacks with different outfits, items like goggles, helmets, and boots are all tied to the skin they come with. So no astronaut suit with a cowboy hat for you.</p>

 <p>“The fact that [the] entire costume comes in one piece with some minimal customization,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm95vw5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment reads</a>, “rather than pieces you can slap on later and recombine with other stuff kinda drags value down for me.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm8blmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">highly upvoted comment reads</a>, “Step 1: Don’t buy it. Step 2: Watch as prices become reasonable.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1om2l23/we_need_to_be_able_to_mix_match_helmets_round_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit post with nearly 1,000 upvotes</a> encourages players to use Embark Studios’ support site to request the ability to swap helmets across different outfits.</p>

   <p>Other folks haven’t been as kind, with one popular post on Reddit describing a particular facial cosmetic as paying four bucks to “have poop smeared on your face,” while countless other players are upset over a lack of customization options for things such as beards.</p>   <p>Perhaps these pricing concerns wouldn’t be as salient if the game were free-to-play, like Embark’s other game <i>The Finals</i>. But given the $40 asking price, which feels plenty fair for a game of this scale, demanding half the cost of the game just to dress up a certain way feels odd to say the least.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I just thought you'd want to know.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey. Hey you. Yes, you. The one playing Hollow Knight: Silksong. I just wanted to let you know, before you go any further, that you're missing a bench in Bilewater. Just in case that helps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not to Bilewater yet, this PSA is still for you. You will get there, and you will want to know this. I am going to spoil what's in Bilewater in this piece, so if you don't want to know that information, leave and come back when you've gotten sufficiently angry at Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bilewater is notorious. It is a massive, disgusting zone on the other side of the already frustrating Sinner's Road that you can stumble into fairly early on in Act 1 of Silksong, and which is required if you ever want to see the game's Act 3. There are many reasons why Bilewater is loathesome: it has many obnoxious enemy types that can ambush you and ruin your day, there are lots of spikes you can fall on and hurt yourself, and notably, it is full of maggot-infested water that will stop you from healing and regenerating silk. Bilewater is <em>awful.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But apart from the grub-water, one of the most standout horrors of Bilewater is its lack of benches. There's one bench way, way down at the bottom of Bilewater, in the Bell Beast station. At first, you might be tricked into thinking there is a second bench nearer the top lefthand side of the zone but, surprise! It's a trap. Not a bench at all. Down into the maggot water you fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So...uh...is that it? Is the Bell Beast bench really the only bench in Bilewater? Do you really have to do the entire zone, and the long, agonizing run back up to its boss over rivers of maggot-infested goop, past piles of spikes and exploding bug enemies and those awful things that belch poison at you, all with no break?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't. Be free. You're missing a bench in Bilewater. It is here:</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="671" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nf4p7r/theres_a_secret_bench_in_bilewater_which_makes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silksong</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">detailed guide to getting through Bilewater</a> here on IGN, which you should use to find this bench when the time comes. The short version is that the hidden Bilewater bench is located behind a breakable wall on the far right-hand side of a cavern, past a giant pool of maggot soup at the bottom of a pit. Break the wall and drop down through another pit, then break another wall on your left to find the secret bench. This one, mercifully, is safe, and will not unceremoniously dump you into a pool of misery when you try to sit down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This bench is much, much closer to Bilewater's boss, Groal, though it's still a bit of a trek up to him. Again, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">our walkthrough</a> for help on surviving Bilewater, because it really is just a disgusting and difficult place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen a lot of people suggest that the run back to Groal, even with the help of the hidden bench, is one of the worst runbacks in the Souls genre. We're curious if you agree, so we set up the poll above. Vote to let us know which of these bosses has the worst runback from safety to their arena every time you die and have to attempt fighting them again. Or let us know in the comments if there's a worse fight we haven't mentioned here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to our Bilewater guide, we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Walkthrough">detailed Wiki</a> to help you through every step of your journey in Pharloom, so check it out before, during, and after Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">FPS fans have spent months obsessing about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> map sizes, so some players finally took the time to measure and compare nearly every map the series has seen in the last 15 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield map size breakdown is a collaborative effort organized by Reddit users ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC and includes multiplayer locations featured in Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, Battlefield: Hardline, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 2042, and, of course, last month’s Battlefield 6. It comes not only with a side-by-side comparison for each game’s map, organized by game mode and player count, but also color-coded horizontal bar graphs, illustrating how EA’s approach to map sizes has changed through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed shared details about their analysis in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/comment/nmsbalz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a follow-up post</u></a>, clarifying that they have “done nothing but work on this the entire weekend.” The more than 45 hours of work resulted in a six-game, 72-map breakdown that paints a clear picture: Battlefield 6 doesn’t quite reach the gargantuan size of some of the series’ biggest maps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed points out that, while many of the relatively small Battlefield 6 maps, like Iberian Offensive or Siege of Cairo, are similar in size to maps seen in Battlefield 3 and 1, many of its larger maps rank among the medium-sized pool of maps studied. While games like Battlefield 3 and even Battlefield 2042 boast some of the most colossal maps the series has seen yet, Battlefield 6 falls short of offering even one map in the top 20. Even its largest map, Operation Firestorm, which itself is a downsized remake of the Battlefield 3 map of the same name, lands as the 32nd biggest map for total shared playable area and 22nd for total map area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are numbers the Battlefield community is already latching onto, but there are a few notes to consider. The evaluation stops short of including every map in the series, for example, with 2018’s Battlefield V, which ClaraTheRed says was difficult to gather data for, being one omission. Battlefield titles have also been known to alter the play area mid-match thanks to features like Levolution and environmental hazards, which some portions of the study consider. Every game that is included also has the benefit of being a completed work, DLC included – Battlefield 6 launched less than one month ago.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have continued to push updates for its new Battlefield game in the weeks since its release, with Season 1 introducing a medium-sized map with Blackwell Fields last week, and another called Eastwood set to follow later this month. There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec"><u>Battlefield REDSEC</u></a>, a standalone offshoot with ties to the Battlefield 6 experience, which also launched last week. EA has proudly declared its map, Fort Lyndon, as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-alongside-battlefield-6-season-1-with-battle-royale-gauntlet-and-portal-modes-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"><u>“biggest Battlefield map ever,”</u></a> though much of the community has already placed it into a separate category thanks to its status as a battle royale map included with REDSEC, not Battlefield 6, specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 fans who hopped in as early as the August beta tests have spent months clamoring for larger maps as EA and BF Studios continue to work on post-launch content. It’s a topic that has set the community on fire, as some work to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/comment/nmsdiq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>defend Battlefield 6’s current offerings</u></a> while others take to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps">review-bombing</a> to express their dissatisfaction with map sizes, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The two of us are not here to complain about map sizes in BF6 (although we do have our opinions on them),” ClaraTheRed clarifies, “but we're here to provide context and show that Battlefield maps throughout the last decade and a half have varied in size by a tremendous amount.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Fort Lyndon Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players will likely continue to break down new maps as future seasons roll out.

                <p>Rapper Soulja Boy is once again trying to sell a game console, this time selling what looks to be a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2 under the name SouljaGame Flip.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/souljaboygame/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=aec8034c-b1b7-449b-ae69-bc2e82cd594a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> (spotted by <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>), the artist known for his 2007 hit song "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" can be seen showing off what appears to be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2. He said the device is actually a new SouljaGame Flip console that is "out right now" and can be bought from his website. He said it has "all the games you need," a "fast processor," and "good graphics."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulja Boy was originally selling "his" console for $436, over twice the $209 price the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 currently goes for on <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-flip-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retroid's official website</a>. But since news began to circulate about the rebranded device and its hefty price tag, the price seems to have been slashed to $200, actually making it cheaper than buying the device directly from Retroid.</p><p dir="ltr">The website where the SouljaGame Flip can be ordered shows images that look to be taken straight from Retroid's own website, only with some additional images showing white packaging that say SouljaGame. Even the names of the different console colors on the Soulja Boy website are the same as that of the Retroid Pocket Flip 2, including the GameCube-inspired GC color scheme. The console's store page description states the SouljaGame Flip is "the ultimate handheld gaming console endorsed by Soulja Boy."</p><p dir="ltr">Retro Dodo reached out to Retroid about the whole affair, and received an official statement that made clear Soulja Boy selling repackaged Retroid Pocket Flip 2s is not any kind of official partnership.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is not any kind of official licensing deal," Retroid said.

<figure data-uuid="47cdbbd114c96"><a title="RE Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47cdbbd114c96/re-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly following its official announcement, the Resident Evil Pro Controller for Switch 2 has become available to pre-order.</p>
<p>So if you're really keen on picking this up, you might want to get moving before it's sold out. Something's telling us, however, that this might not happen, because good <em>lord</em> is it expensive.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available in the UK at an eye-watering <strong>£83.99</strong> via the My Nintendo store, which is even more expensive than the regular Pro Controller at <strong>£74.99</strong>. Over in the US, meanwhile, Best Buy is currently offering pre-orders at <strong>$99.99</strong> – the price for the bog-standard Pro Controller over in the states is <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's an expensive one. Aesthetically, it's not a patch on the classic <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_Controller">Chainsaw Controller</a> from the GameCube days, either, but we can't have everything, can we?</p>
<p>Truth be told, we do like the overall design, but man, that Switch 2 logo in the centre is really doing its best to ruin everything, huh? It's literally obscuring the Resident Evil title, alongside a whole bunch of cool iconography from the overall design.</p>
<p>Still, it's neat that Nintendo is willing to allow a third-party Pro Controller at all, and the fact that it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, of all things, is really cool.</p>
<p>Both the game and the Pro Controller will launch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. A Grace Ashcroft amiibo will follow later in the year during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It will be years before we are close to even the release date for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion, but that hasn't stopped people from asking CD Projekt RED and anyone connected to the series about it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">We know the game is in pre-production</a>, and that it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">feature a kind of "<em>Chicago gone wrong</em>"</a> setting, and as of September, we know that Hollywood star <a href="https://wccftech.com/keanu-reeves-absolutely-play-johnny-silverhand-cyberpunk-2077-sequel/">Keanu Reeves would "<em>absolutely</em>" love to find a way back to the series to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand</a>. </p>



<p>Well, according to series creator Mike Pondsmith in a recent anniversary live stream that CD Projekt RED hosted, all Reeves needs to do is pick up the phone. Speaking on the stream, Pondsmith said, "<em>Not that long ago</em>, <em>I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I have ways to do that, Keanu</em>. <em>Contact me</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REDstreams special — Interview with Mike Pondsmith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_HsIlaqMkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Pondsmith has already made it clear that he's not as involved with the sequel as he was with the first game, so while he might have an idea as to how Johnny Silverhand could come back from the dead and get Keanu Reeves back in the game, he might not necessarily have the authority to make it happen. CD Projekt RED could be on an entirely different path that doesn't involve Silverhand, so even if Reeves picks up the phone, it's not a sure bet.</p>



<p>Still, it would be exciting for fans to see him make a comeback in a way more meaningful than perhaps a flashback scene, which is currently the most feasible way we'd see Silverhand again.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-new-simpsons-season-is-an-incredible-treat-for-fans-of-the-show.1342534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663#:~:text=The%20Simpsons%20are%20seemingly%20on%20their%20way%20to%20Fornite%C2%A0">After rumors and leaks</a>, <em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season went live over the weekend, and I had a giant smile on my face as I ran around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296">new Springfield map</a>, no matter how many times I got sniped by random Gokus and Peelys.</p> <p>Over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">I’ve made it very clear that I’m not a fan of the growing trend of crossovers in video games</a>. Sticking Master Chief in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> or jamming Godzilla into <em>Call of Duty</em> has always been weird and nasty to me. It feels like all of pop culture is merging into a giant grey blob. It makes me sad. Yet, I always give <em>Fortnite</em> a pass because, for many years now, it has been an IP playground. <em>Fortnite</em> is just a giant mess of stuff, a new internet for the next generation. So what if they add Luke Skywalker or Ariana Grande to it? But even if I wasn’t willing to give <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a> a pass, I’d still be playing this new <em>Simpsons</em> season because it’s so dang good.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-simpsons-drop-into-springfield-in-br-and-delulu?lang=en-US">Launched on November 1</a>, the<em> Fortnite x Simpsons</em> mini-season turns the entire battle royale into a <em>Simpsons</em> video game, something we haven’t gotten in over a decade. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796">it’s been nearly 20 years since the last console-based <em>Simpsons</em> game</a> and over two decades since 2005’s beloved <em>Simpsons Hit and Run</em>. That alone makes this new <em>Fortnite</em> season super special. The first time I landed at Evergreen Terrace in <em>Fortnite</em> and explored the Simpsons’ house, I had the biggest grin on my face and was excited to just poke at each room and detail. I was quickly killed by someone actually playing the game, but I didn’t care. I was finally playing a new, modern 3D <em>Simpsons</em> game in 2025, even if it was just a <em>Fortnite</em> event.</p>

  <p>Exploring beyond the Simpsons’ home, I found so many locations and details from the show. Want to visit Moe’s Bar? It’s here, and you can even hear a prank call from Bart. The first time I visited the Nuclear Power Plant, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Trivia">I heard a crow squawk, a detail that is always included when the location appears in an episode</a>. The Aztec Theatre is here. Mr. Burns’ massive mansion is fully explorable. Kamp Krusty is falling apart, but still explorable and properly dilapidated. Even the tire fire and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Tomacco">tomacco farm</a> can be found in <em>Fortnite’s</em> new Springfield map. I even found a store selling Poochie merch. If you’re a big fan of the show like me, you’ll likely die a lot this season because you’ll be too distracted by Easter eggs, references, and details to notice the enemy players hunting you down.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640879">©Epic / Disney</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, beyond the map are skins based on characters from the show. At the moment, the battle pass has added Marge and Homer, and Bart is for sale in the store. Bart is wearing a strange mech exo-suit thing, which I get is the only way to make that character work within <em>Fortnite’s</em> proportions, but it does look odd. Based on leaks and trailers, we know that Krusty, Moe, Ned, Scratchy, and a <em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;spin on Peely are coming, too. Personally, I hope a few more characters are coming as well, but my wallet is begging for the opposite.</p>

 <p>We are even getting a series of animated <em>Simpsons</em> shorts that connect to this new <em>Fortnite</em> season, with many of the original voice actors involved. And the main series on Fox included a grisly bit involving Peely in the show’s latest episode. It’s full-on media synergy, baby!</p>

  <p>But yeah, a few days into this new <em>Fortnite</em> x <em>Simpsons</em> season, I’m hugely impressed with what Epic has pulled off. The new island is not only fun to play on and filled with tons of details, but it also looks gorgeous. Everything has this show-accurate cel-shaded look, from random pieces of flooring to iconic buildings and more. I really hope Epic lets people tinker with this map within <em>Fortnite’s</em> content creation tools in the future because it feels like a waste to throw it all away at the end of this month when the mini-season wraps up.</p> <p>Until then, I’ll be dropping in on Springfield, saying thanks to Otto (the season’s bus driver) and finding more Easter eggs and silly details from my favorite comedy series of all time. And hey, maybe this season’s popularity will remind Disney that people want <em>Simpsons</em>-themed video games? One can hope.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-says-it-will-keep-%E2%80%9Ccreative-control%E2%80%9D-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through.1342531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is trying to ease concerns for employees about what could happen to their games if the planned sale to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) is finalized. </p>



<p>In a new SEC filing, first spotted by Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, EA has updated its employee FAQ to answer numerous questions surrounding the proposed sale. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific section</a> regarding the culture at the company, EA says that its mission and values will <strong>“remain unchanged.”</strong> It adds that the company will <strong>“maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact.”</strong></p>



<p>The section continues, <strong>“We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork,”</strong> and that “<strong>The Consortium is supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and our strong culture.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-other-changes-at-ea">What About Other Changes At EA?</h2>



<p>It’s not just control over projects and games that employees have had questions about. With the group that includes the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners taking on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-bioware-producer-suggests-ea-sell-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$20 billion in debt</a> for this deal, some were concerned about future growth and even layoffs.</p>



<p>To both points, EA, as of now, says there shouldn’t be any worry.</p>



<p><strong>“There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction,”</strong> EA says. </p>



<p>Regarding growth, the company says that they will continue to pursue “<strong>organic and inorganic growth opportunities as a private company, even with new debt”</strong> and that there is an expectation to invest in the business in order to <strong>“accelerate innovation.”</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$55 billion deal to sell</a> EA and take it private is expected to close sometime after the start of Q1 fiscal year 2027 (after March 31, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think will happen when the sale of EA to the group led by the Saudi Arabia PIF is finalized next year?

                <p>If you had any concerns that developer Embark Studios would embrace the Call of Duty-like goofy costumes for its stylish extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you can rest assured. While you never say never, the team has made it clear that "novelty" skins are not coming to the game at this point.</p><p>Design director Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> on October 30 that the game's visual identity is so strong that adding silly skins would tarnish that artistic vision.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>"What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have," Watkins said. "It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction."</p><p>That's not to say "novelty" skins like Ronald McDonald or something like that will never appear in Arc Raiders. Instead, if Embark Studios were to consider these out-of-place costumes, Watkins said the team would likely create a skin that alludes to a person rather than being that person. Think more color scheme and less actual appearance. So, no <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">Nicki Minajs</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-adds-snoop-dogg-as-a-playable-character/1100-6502133/" data-ref-id="1100-6502133">Snoop Doggs</a> here.</p><p>"I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus," Watkins said. "That's not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that's kind of the line you can draw. We're pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don't know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly--I don't think the novelty is worth the trade."</p><p>It would be hilarious to see Santa Claus or a T-Rex-- or even Sabrina Carpenter--tearing robots apart with a pulse rifle, but that doesn't fit the game's design language. Maybe this could happen in the future, but for now, there are no such "novelty" skins coming.</p><p>"Novelty" and silly skins have been a hot-button topic in shooters lately, particularly among the likes of Battlefield and Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">admitted that the series may have strayed from its grittier identity</a>, confirming that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> won't let you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">transfer your wacky costumes</a> from Black Ops 6.

			<p>Bill Roper, a Blizzard veteran who worked on the first games in the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises in various capacities (producer, design, voice-over, etc.), has announced that his studio has secured funding for Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>The studio, Lunacy Games, was actually supposed to produce <a href="https://wccftech.com/hellgate-redemption-ue5-sequel-hellgate-london-details-sketchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellgate: Redemption</a>, a sequel to Hellgate: London, a cult classic Diablo-like game that Roper created after departing from Blizzard, and a game called Skinwalkers, which would merge the Weird West and Cthulhu settings, with players acting as cowboys. However, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/bill-robers-lunacy-games-raises-500k-from-accelerator-for-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, Roper said the studio couldn't find anyone who would fund this project, which required between $15 million and $20 million. </p>



<p>They did find someone to fund Innsmouth Mysteries, though. <a href="https://www.bbx.games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bang Accelerator</a> agreed to provide $500K for the project, which is a cooperative horror extraction roleplaying game inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In a mysterious 1920s seaside town, a team of player-controlled supernatural investigators must uncover the truth, collect arcane artifacts, and stop an ancient evil from being unleashed before midnight strikes.</p>



<p>Ying Sha, co-founder of BBX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Lunacy Games has a clear and compelling vision for a Co-op Horror Extraction RPG, and it's backed by a team of veterans whose track record speaks for itself. We are proud to support studios like theirs that are pushing the boundaries of games. We see Innsmouth Mysteries as a project that perfectly aligns with our mission to support talented teams to bring high-quality, deeply engaging experiences to players.</em></p>



<p>For his part, Roper believes there's a significant middle ground between triple-A and indie games that is currently underserved, a place where exciting gameplay mixes with deep, immersive, and story-rich experiences, which the studio aims to deliver with Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>Lunacy Games currently has just 13 employees, and Roper himself contributes to the audio work as well. There's no release window yet, but we'll keep track of the progress.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government urging action against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a> has been debated in parliament.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition</a>, which amassed just under 190,000 signatures prior to its closure in July, received a response from the UK government back in February, when it hit 10,000. "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games," this reply read. "Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue." As is the process, once it hit 100,000 signatures, it was eligible to be debated by parliament's petitions committee.</p>

<p>The debate lasted around an hour, and saw various MPs ask the government - represented by minister for sport, tourism, civil society and youth Stephanie Peacock - to respond to and provide extra clarity as to how its approaching the concerns set forth about game server shutdowns by the petition and some constituents. It also saw about a million game names be added to Hansard, the record of everything said in parliament, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> and a Super Mario World ROM hack trilogy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlMCTw5gTdk">Grand Poo World</a>.</p><p>In the end, Peacock stuck to the government's established line of making no amendments to the law, but working to ensure companies are providing consumers with the info they should when selling games. The government see the existing legislation designed to stop sellers misleading those buying goods by not providing accurate or complete info in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents">2015's consumer rights act</a> and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2024/13/contents">2024's digital markets, competition and consumers act</a> as doing the job they need to, with Peacock saying: "The law works, but companies may need to communicate better". Meanwhile, in terms of the campaign's ask that publishers are mandated to provide a means for games to keep going after servers are switched off via a final patch or handing this over the community, Peacock said the following:</p>
<blockquote>The government is sympathetic to the concerns raised, but we do also recognise the challenges in delivering this from the video game industry perspective. First, this would have a negativen technical impact on video game development. It is true that there are some games where it would be relatively simple to patch an offline mode after its initial release, but for games whose systems have been specifically designed for an online experience this wouldn't be possible without major redevelopment. Requiring an end of life plan for all games would fundamentally change how games are developed and distributed. While that may well be the desired outcome for some campaigners, it isn't right to say the solutions would either be simple or inexpensive.</blockquote>
<p>In terms of the keys being handed to fan-run custom servers, Peacock pointed to a difficulty in determining who's then legally responsible for ensuring the game stays secure and complies with the law. Potential mixups which lead to people placing blame with the original developer or other harm to their reputation was another cited sticking point.</p>
<p>The government are considering taking one form of action based on the petition, that being having the <a href="https://www.tradingstandards.uk/">Chartered Trading Standards Institute</a> to put together specific guidance aimed at helping businesses ensure they're providing game buyers with the info the law requires.</p><p>The debate wasn't going to see the government suddenly do a 180 on their already stated response to the issue, but generally speaking I thought the MPs asking for clarification made some good points and had clearly done their homework. One thing in particular that caught my attention was Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon bringing up the recent deal for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">an investment group led by Saudi Arabia to take over EA</a> as the sort of corporate dealing that could see the waters muddied in terms of where the responsibility lies to ensure games do follow the rules in terms of server shutdowns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Labour MP Mark Sewards outlined his view that the government's current relatively laissez faire approach outside of making sure current laws are adhered to might not be ideal in the long run. "If we don't act now, the use of this model and the erosion of ownership rights may spread to other areas," he said. "I think that the warning signs are here in this industry and to act now would be far less painful than to wait until this practice has become entrenched."</p>
<p>This may be the end of the road for Stop Killing Games' UK petition, at least for now, but the wider campaign is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-half-the-148-million-stop-destroying-videogames-signatures-have-been-okayed-as-campaigners-seek-expert-backing">in the process of preparing and waiting</a> for EU politicians to debate its citizens initiative on the issue.</p>
