		<p>Kayak VR: Mirage, as we noted in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/21/kayak-vr-mirage-psvr-2-review/">our original review</a>, is a rather minimalist experience. Sure, there’s a competitive mode where you can race against ghosts of other players, but you can also just jump in a Kayak and pootle around some stunningly gorgeous locations and relax. In his review, Stefan also commented, “For me, though, I was left wanting something more […] a kayak slalom in the whitewater rapids.” It appears developers Better Than Life – who win all the points for that Red Dwarf VR reference – were listening, as that’s exactly what you get in the Yucatán DLC pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kayak VR: Mirage - Yucatán DLC (including whitewater) | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAAGWaM0Fxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The level begins in a lagoon surrounded on all sides by high cliffs that are covered in tropical vegetation. It is stunning to look at; I have been lucky enough to go to places like this and it does feel real with birds flying around and fish swimming under your kayak. As I was playing this in London during a heatwave, I was suitably hot and humid as well. Sadly, this gorgeous location is not indicative of what you get to play as the rest of the level is set in caves and an old mine.</p>



<p>The first section is very sedate and has you paddling through a few tunnels, ducking down now and then to avoid the cave roof, before things open up into a large cavern full of stalactites and stalagmites, all of which are lit by glowworms crawling up the walls. It’s very pretty and looks like something from a fantasy game, but a quick paddle sees you heading into more caves, which gradually turn into tunnels from an old mine. There’s almost a puzzle element to this section as you paddle through a maze with rockfalls crashing down around you, blocking what seems to be the obvious route.</p>

<p>Eventually the tunnels widen out to another larger cave and the water begins to flow faster, pushing you forward and into, you you guessed it, more tunnels! As the pace picks up have to be alert as the game throws all sorts of obstacles at you, narrowing the passages so you have to lean to squeeze through and even that video game staple, giant fans blade that slice through the water. However, as the game is rated E for Everyone, don’t expect a gory decapitation if you smash in to a slicing blade, you just bump off and can have another try.</p>

<p>And that’s about it. It’s a short and sweet experience, twenty minutes from end to end if you paddle at a decent pace. There’s a time attack mode where you can race ghosts of other players and a tour mode in which you can sit back and let the Kayak navigate itself through the map, the same as the other maps in game.</p>
<p>The cave system is completely different to other locations in the game, which are all set in wide open areas, and this change adds some variety to your paddling, but it does mean you don’t get the majestic views found in other locations. You also have to rely on a head mounted torch for some sections and, like all torches in all video games, it’s weaker than a cup of tea made by an American.</p>
<p>The Yucatán DLC is definitely worth a look if you already own Kayak VR: Mirage as it does bring something new to the game, but I think I preferred some of the other locations which were less enclosed and allowed you to marvel at how gorgeous VR can look.</p>

<p>With Switch 2 now hosting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur</a> and the like, have you got a case of GameCube fever? If so, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/misc_a_tiny_tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a> might be just the soothing ointment you need to apply generously all over your body. Lead developer Michael Pearce has said it was inspired by the games of his youth, and it only takes a glance at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/misc-a-tiny-tale-will-fill-the-chibi-robo-sized-hole-in-your-heart-this-july">the trailer</a> to see that those games must surely have included GameCube favourites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo!</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. Taking that retro inspiration, Misc is a 3D platformer featuring a teeny-weeny robot bobbling about and helping people in a quirky post-human world.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157252/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The debut release from Tinyware Games, Misc was made by a core team of three, winning funding from the Australian government along the way. It was developed for Nintendo Switch (which is the version reviewed here) and PC but, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/misc-a-tiny-tale-looks-super-smooth-on-switch-2-thanks-to-a-dev-hunch">as reported on Nintendo Life last month</a>, Tinyware took a punt on Switch 2’s approach to backwards compatibility, meaning the new console does deliver a significant boost in graphics and performance – but more on that later.</p>
<p>The story revolves around an inch-tall robot named Buddy and his friend Bag Boy – a unicycle robot with a paper bag on his head. One day, they hear an explosion in their little garden village, then set out on an adventure to find out what it was. As they go, they visit other locales peppered with friendly robo-characters to lend a hand to, run errands for, or trade with.</p>
<p>As simple as the story is, it’s nice to go on a quest just because something went bang, not because the world’s ending again – and it doesn’t hold back on throwing in some dramatic moments later on. This is supported well by the music, which has a storybook quality, some eerie moments, and even a few songs for the emotional peaks.</p>
<p>Each village area you visit on Buddy’s odyssey has a locked exit gate and a scattering of collectibles. There’s not too many — no collectathon trinket fixation here — and they’re split between major golden cogs and minor metal nuts. The metal nuts are more plentiful, left in short trails to nudge you around the level, while the golden cogs are the keys to opening the gates. Each area has ten cogs, with eight required for progression. A little icing on that quite appetising collectibles cake is a feel-good "Difference Made" system (think Chibi-Robo’s Happy Points) which counts up your positive influence on the world as you potter about litter-picking and scrubbing goop.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157200/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But collecting golden cogs is the backbone of the game. You mainly get them either by completing tasks for NPCs — find a shiny trinket or complete a set of sheet music — or by performing daring feats of platforming and exploration. The platforming is all low-stakes stuff — there are no lives to lose or anything like that — but when you fall, you will be left having to retrace your steps, which can sometimes be a bit of a downer.</p>
<p>Alongside some retrying, the jump-feel takes a bit of getting used to. It’s floaty by design, with Buddy having a propeller on his head to extend his air time, and the camera will need plenty of manual nudging to get sight of both where you’re aiming and where your drop shadow’s going. It was a good decision on Tinyware’s part to put the most challenging jumping in separate underground sections — one on each level — without any golden cogs riding on it. Tucking the 'real' platforming away in break-outs like this reminded me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>’s wooden-block courses – another GameCube reminiscence.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157201/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While we’re on the subject of controls, there are duck and dive manoeuvres that are almost never needed, as if they’d been forgotten, and a stamina gauge to throttle your sprinting that just seemed unnecessary to me. Misc does control well once you’ve clicked with it, but these details make it feel just a little bit baggy.</p>
<p>Most of the action happens in outdoor settings a bit reminiscent of Pikmin. However, a graphical comparison with Switch contemporary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> is not <em>especially</em> flattering. The environments are varied, particularly later in the game, although they sometimes seem a little barren. While most levels don’t feel like places characters might actually live, their charm and creativity still come through.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Switch isn’t doing the game any favours: it simply can’t render the game at its best. Resolution is low, and distant assets are hard to make out, with a lot of shimmering. The default setting for focus blur is a little heavy-handed — not so much Vaseline on the lens as a custard pie — obscuring anything at a distance and making it hard to get your bearings. Once I discovered I could turn the blur off, it didn’t go back on – for simple playability more than aesthetics.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157199/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And that little bit of navigation help was really needed in some villages. I eventually managed to frame the levels around distinctive landmarks, but scouring places for the last couple of cogs sometimes led to walking — albeit rather cutely — in circles. As I climbed up the same stack of buckets for the fourteenth time, even Bag Boy starting giving me funny looks. Add some invisible walls and blocked gaps that look like you could go through them, and more than once I was ready to move on before having the required cogs.</p>
<p>A test on Switch 2 told a different story altogether. The resolution at distance is great, movement is much smoother, and load times are shorter. I still preferred to have the blur turned off, but the ability to survey levels properly from high vantage points helped no end in finding my way around. Again, though, it’s the Switch 1 'version' under review here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Misc. A Tiny Tale is a charming and delightful first effort from Tinyware – albeit with some wobbles in execution. It sticks very close to classic ideas and struggles with graphical fidelity on Switch, but none of that can undo the charm of the characters and the retro vibe straight from the GameCube era. Until Chibi-Robo hits Nintendo Classics, this will serve all your miniature robot helper needs.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.</em></p><p><em>It's been awfully hot in various parts of Remap Country these days, and honestly, there's really nothing worse than trying to sleep through a layer of sweat. (Patrick is the only one who can just crank up the ol' AC.)</em></p><p><em>But even in "ideal" conditions, sleep does not always come easy. Maybe your brain can't turn off. Or, as Rob has dealt with throughout the week, your leg is throbbing with pain. Not exactly what one would call ideal. </em></p><p><em>Hopefully you're reading this after a good night's rest. But if not? Well, Rob and Patrick have plenty of stories about the nature of sleep.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I am, generally, a sound sleeper. Once I’m out, I’m out. I can’t nap for shit, a grace only granted by my body when all other options have been exhausted. (This happened most recently while flying from Chicago to Los Angeles for Summer Game Fest following an intense family wedding, in which I downed an entire cup of McDonalds coffee, only to pass out for two hours.)</p><p>But when I can’t sleep, I get fidgety. I twist, turn. I think about looking at my phone. I wonder if having a new, cooler pillow would help. Maybe if I drank a glass of water? Oh, it must be because I’ve started going to the bathroom more often in my early 40s, so I should go pee.</p><p>Inevitably, this practice disturbs, then awakens, my wife. She does not sleep well. Getting to sleep isn’t the problem—it’s <em>staying</em> asleep. Her brain doesn’t enter a zombie state when she wakes up at 2am. Instead, it’s time to get up for the day and start thinking about all the problems, issues, and tensions coming. Did you remember to make the kids lunch for school?</p><p>Our evening routine these days usually goes like this:</p><ul><li>Feed the children, then feed ourselves</li><li>Watch something on TV with the kids</li><li>Give the children a little bit of independent tablet time</li><li>Start the (increasingly long) bedtime routine for both children</li><li>Hang out on the couch with one another, preferably with a short TV episode</li><li>My wife heads to bed, while I play video games for an hour or two</li><li>I head to bed, slowly closing the bathroom door to hide my toothbrush buzzing</li></ul><p>When the Switch came out, my wife wondered if this portable wonder could solve the problem of us not sleeping together during weekdays. She asked if I could try playing in bed as she dozed off. Within minutes, she turned over and asked “Do you have to press the buttons <em>that</em> hard?” Needless to say, the experiment did not last more than a night. I, uh, now play on the couch.</p><p>A few years back, we added bunk beds to my oldest daughter’s room. She was excited to share a room with her sister, but in reality, that second bed became the place I went to when I was having a restless night, feeling sick, etc. Like I said, I sleep pretty well and am thankful for that, but on nights where it <em>wasn’t</em> going my way, the last thing I wanted to do was ruin the upcoming day for the other person, too. And generally speaking, a bed “reset” would often do the trick for me, because I could remove the anxiety of disrupting my partner and focus on relaxing myself.</p><p>Just this past year, though, we swapped the bunk beds for a loft bed, aka the one where the bed sits high and there’s a desk underneath. It’s super popular with kids these days, especially since that’s a spot to store all their various electronics and whatever. Cool! Loft bed seems neat. But it also saw the death of my 2nd bed, which means my only outlet for crashing on a rough night is the couch. And look, we spend decent money on both couches, but they are not bed quality!</p><p>My youngest has asked to inherit the bunk beds, but putting them back together is <em>such</em> a pain in the ass. I told her we could talk about it when she turns six next year. And as much as I’m not excited for all the (re)building, I gotta say I’d be really happy to have that other bed back again.</p><p>I know that you’re working through a leg injury at the moment. Some of my worst nights have been while working through the cycling pain and anxiety of recovery. How’s your bed situation?&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@dreadpiratekato?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kate Stone Matheson</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>My left leg is cursed. I talked about my ACL surgery in high school. A few years ago I had to have tendon surgery because I was headed toward a rupture due to some bone spurs in my heel, so that laid me up for about four or five weeks. Fortunately <em>Destiny: The Taken King </em>had just come out so I mostly spent that month in a fugue playing <em>Destiny </em>on my couch. Now I have an almighty bruise from tripping on an ottoman (and landing on the edge of said ottoman with my shin). The musculature in the two legs is completely different, which makes finding pants a fun issue even setting aside my weight and height. Anyway, right now it’s about three times larger than my other leg with swelling, and if I don’t keep it elevated, it starts throbbing in a way that starts as mildly irritating and swiftly becomes borderline excruciating. Especially at night.</p>

Each person takes on a person who might appear in the painting, deciding among yourselves what kind of place this diner is, what sorts of relationships you might have between you. The GM-free game leaves players exploring the topic of loneliness together, choosing whether they might succumb or battle against it.

It provides a broad range of services, either free or low-cost, in many parts of Texas, and again is reliant on donations to continue its work. And why a Texan organization given the Californian nature of this bundle? That’s because a lot of the people ICE targets in LA are then forcibly taken to Texas.</p><p>So, you know, even if you pay the $10 (or as much as you want to give) and then forget you ever did, you’ve made an important difference.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new Oblivion Remastered patch released <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-reduce-stutters/">earlier this week</a> brings some performance improvements over the previous version of the game, but the game is still very far from being in an optimal state, as even hgih-end hardware struggles running the game at high native resolutions without Frame Generation.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by MxBenchmarkPC compares the 1.2 version of the game with the launch version, highlighting how the performance improvements promised in the patch notes are indeed noticeable, but the overall situation is still not optimal. In a GPU-limited scenario on an RTX 5080, with NVIDIA DLSS in quality mode, ultra settings, and no Frame Generation, one of the most powerful GPUs on the market struggles to hit the 60 FPS mark at 4K resolution, and the 70 FPS mark at 1440p resolution, but even in a CPU-limited scenario, performance is far from being optimal, given the hardware. Things don't fare any better at native resolution, as the game runs at barely above 30 FPS at native 4K resolution, and in the 40s FPS range with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode. To hit anything past the 60 FPS mark, Oblivion Remastered needs Frame Generation, which is baffling, considering the GPU the game is running on, but sadly not surprising, considering the remake of the fourth entry in the series is most definitely not the only game powered by Unreal Engine 5 that doesn't run well on PC.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After being rumored to be in the works for a while, Oblivion Remastered was finally revealed and launched this April. Although the shift in atmosphere may be difficult to ignore for some players, and the performance leaves a lot to be desired, the new version of the classic RPG by Bethesda is one worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>

Prior to Nintendo, Takahashi worked at Sega and Square Enix on franchises such as Sonic and Final Fantasy. Motokura, meanwhile, directed Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-finally-confirmed-by-nintendo-sparking-questions-over-when-switch-2s-3d-mario-will-arrive">confirmed to IGN last month</a> that Bananza was being worked on by the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, without detailing exactly who. But now we know who the game's top developers are — and we even know <em>why </em>the game exists, as IGN was told the idea came from Odyssey producer and Nintendo legend Yoshiaki Koizumi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's the part that now has fans wondering.

(I Hope...)" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the arrival of another 3D Mario game at some point is assured, and none of this speculation appears to be taking away from the fact that Donkey Kong Bananza looks set to be Nintendo's next big and very promising-looking new 3D platformer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the absence of a new 3D Mario around the Switch 2's launch, and an increasingly lengthy wait for a new 3D Mario — since Odyssey's launch back in 2017 — has inevitably sparked speculation, and a hope that, alongside the upcoming delights of Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo's next Mario outing is still not too far away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Donkey Kong Bananza details revealed by IGN this week include the fact <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-was-originally-a-nintendo-switch-1-game">the game started life on Nintendo Switch 1</a>, as well as fresh chatter from Nintendo on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-leads-say-the-reason-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-is-for-the-player-to-puzzle-out">how Bananza fits into Donkey Kong canon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s increasingly messy saga has taken another dramatic turn. Developer Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders have announced legal action against Krafton after the publisher shared a statement accusing the former employees of 'abandoning' the underwater survival sequel.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.
</p>
<p>
Fan pushback was swift, especially given Krafton's talk of "metrics and targets" and the suggestion it might be cracking the whip to get the game complete "as soon as possible". And the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026. It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>.

<p>
Responding to Bloomberg's report, Krafton insisted the delay was "not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations" but was instead merely to improve the game following feedback. This directly contradicted an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">earlier statement made by Cleveland to fans</a> following his departure, claiming Subnautica 2 was "ready for early access". But Krafton didn't stop there; first it posted a new gameplay trailer, presumably in a bid to try and quell the growing community discontent, then, overnight, it issued another statement, this one far less diplomatic than the rest, directly accusing Cleveland and co. of "abandoning [their] responsibilities".
</p>
<p>
"Subnautica 2 was originally planned for early access launch in early 2024," it wrote, "but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as game director and technical director respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project."
</p>
<p>
All this, Krafton insisted, resulted in "repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule", leading to what it called an early access version that "falls short in terms of content volume". It added it was "deeply disappointed in the former leadership's conduct", who it accused of failing to "honour the trust placed in them by our fans". It also claimed that 90 percent of the $250m payout highlighted in Bloomberg's earlier report would have gone to Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill.

<p>
But it seems the gloves are now well and truly off, with Cleveland responding to Krafton's statement with an announcement of legal action. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">post to the Subnautica community</a>, he described the ongoing saga as an "explosive and surreal time for the Subnautica team and community", reiterating that "we know in our souls that the game is ready for early access."
</p>
<p>
"We've now filed a lawsuit against Krafton," Cleveland continued. "The details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life's work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it."
</p>
<p>
"As for the earnout," he continued, "the idea that Max, Ted, and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue. I'm in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we've always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we'll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands."
</p>
<p>
And that's where things currently stand. Assuming it doesn't get caught in the legal crossfire, Subnautica 2 is still expected to launch into early access sometime in 2026, and was previously anticipated to remain there for two to three years.

<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/masahiro-sakurai-commemorates-kirby-air-rides-22nd-anniversary-and-10-years-since-satoru-iwatas-passing/">Automaton</a>, Sakurai states that Kirby Air Riders is "shaping up to be something great" as he celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> on GameCube. While it's hardly the most detailed update imaginable, it will still no doubt fuel excitement for those looking forward to Air Riders' upcoming release.</p>
<p>Sakurai also recognised the 10th anniversary of Iwata's death, and pondered on how he would soon be the same age as Iwata at the time of his passing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today was the release date of the GameCube's Kirby Air Ride. 22nd anniversary!!</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also the anniversary of Iwata-san's passing. 2015.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed since then…<br>
Iwata-san and I were about ten years apart in age and when we joined the company, and soon I'll be catching up to his age, won't I?</p>
<p>Right now, I'm pouring my heart into making Kirby Air Riders.<br>
It's shaping up to be something great!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirby Air Riders was announced as part of the Switch 2 Direct back in April this year. No further information has been shared, but it's scheduled to launch at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>In what would be one of his final YouTube videos, Sakurai also paid tribute to Iwata in a 'Grab Bag' special, during which he recounted several memories of the legendary Nintendo executive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is reportedly launching next year, but it may not feature the experience offered by the original in its entirety.</p>



<p>In a recent video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming">Rebs Gaming</a> reported to have talked with two unnamed sources who have connections with Halo series developers. Both have reported that the remake of the first entry in the series will be released to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary next year. The remake, whose development reportedly began in 2023, however, may only feature the single-player campaign, as both sources have heard nothing about multiplayer. Nothing has been said if the yet-to-be-announced remake will also launch on consoles other than Xbox Series X and S, but if it indeed is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unrevealed-new-halo-game-could-launch-on-playstation-5-according-to-new-information/">unrevealed project discovered last month by dataminers</a>, there's the chance it will also mark the series debut on PlayStation 5, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War Reloaded</a> is marking the debut of another of Xbox's tentpole franchises on Sony's console next month.</p>



<p>Besides talking about the Halo Combat Evolved remake, Rebs Gaming also provided an update on Project Ekur, the rebranded battle royale project originally in development as part of Halo Infinite's multiplayer offerings, which was reportedly given to Certain Affinity. While the state of the project is unknown at the moment, known Halo series dataminer grunt.api recently teased some news by posting a new ID code for the game, which was confirmed to be for the project and that is seeing consistent updates in the past few days, indicating that work is continuing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although the Halo Combat Evolved remake has yet to be announced, it will not take long to learn if the project is indeed real, as Halo Studios will reveal what's next for the series at <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">HaloWC 2025</a>, which is taking place in October 2025. Hopefully, we will better understand how the future will shape up for the series that has represented Xbox the most since Microsoft entered the console market after the teased reveals.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publishers Krafton have accused three recently ousted leads of "abandoning" their duties on the game, suggesting that this is to blame for it being delayed. That statement was almost immediately followed by one of the former Unknown Worlds bosses, co-founder Charlie Cleveland, writing in a Reddit post that a lawsuit's been filed by the trio against the company.</p>
<p>These are the latest twists in an ongoing saga that began with Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis being parachuted in to replace Cleveland, fellow co-founder Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">earlier this month</a>. That kicked off a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">war of words</a> between the two sides, punctuated by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">report from Bloomberg</a> which alleged Krafton's call to delay the game was made just before a $250 million bonus was set to be paid to Unknown Worlds staff.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Krafton claimed in <a href="https://krafton.com/en/">a statement</a> published late yesterday that "approximately 90%" of this bonus, tied to the dev team hitting revenue targets, was set to paid to the three ousted leads "with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2".</p>
<p>"However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them," they continued, "Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed." The publishers allege that "multiple requests" for Cleveland and McGuire to resume their responsibilities as game director and technical director were declined by the leads.</p>
<p>"Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule," the statement adds, with the publishers writing that they're "committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees" working on the game. "We reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised," Krafton added, not quite explicitly stating that the remaining devs will definitely get the full $250 million.</p>
<p>So yeah, very much both barrels being pointed at the exiled leads. Enter Charlie Cleveland providing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">an update</a> via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> subreddit.</p>
<p>"We’ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story," he wrote after reiterating his claim that the game was ready for early access, "Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</p>

Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well."</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is a saga that looks very much set to rumble on for the foreseeable, as part of what Cleveland summed up as "an explosive and surreal time for the Subnautica team and community". We'll keep you updated.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sony shed more light on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-drops-predecessors-samurai-combat-to-make-atsu-a-walking-arsenal/1100-6533101/" data-ref-id="1100-6533101">its State of Play</a> earlier this week. While the focus of the event was primarily on the gameplay and story, there's something special coming for fans of the game. Now, Sony has unveiled the first look at the Ghost of Yotei Limited Edition PlayStation 5 bundles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpy0vfXXnd8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tpy0vfXXnd8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two options for fans: Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition Bundle and Ghost of Yotei Black Limited Edition Bundle. The Black model will be exclusively available through PlayStation's official store, while the Gold model will be sold everywhere else. Both bundles include a disc drive, a matching DualSense controller, and a digital copy of Ghost of Yoeti with all preorder bonuses.</p><p>The dev team at Sucker Punch designed both limited editions, and noted that the Gold bundle was inspired by the Japanese art form known as kintsugi, which is used to repair broken objects with gold and lacquer. The Black bundle's look was taken from another Japanese art form called Sumi-e, which puts black ink on paintings.</p><p>"Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration," noted Sucker Punch creative director Jason Connell. "This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings. The towering Mount Yotei is included at the center of the console design to pull it all together, and Atsu is spotlighted on the DualSense controller. Each of these elements were thoughtfully woven into both the console and controller designs."</p><p>Fans who already have a PS5 slim or PS5 Pro will be able to purchase Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition console covers through PlayStation's store. The designs for the DualSense controller will also be available as a separate purchase.</p><p>Both of the limited editions, the console covers, and the controller designs will debut alongside Ghost of Yotei on October 2.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53beccc0d116e/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A major Switch ROM site – 'nsw2u' – has been seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, nsw2u was one of the better-known repositories of Switch ROMS, which allowed users with hacked Switch consoles to download first and third-party games at will; often before their official release dates. In other words, then, it's a website that Nintendo was probably keen to vaporise quicker than Thanos snapping his fingers.</p>
<p>The full message reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with a seizure warrant issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2323 issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia as part of a law enforcement operation and action by: Federal Bureau of Investigation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo has been very strict in recent years over piracy related to Switch software, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-has-seemingly-taken-possession-of-the-ryujinx-switch-emulator-website">taking possession of the Ryujinx emulator site</a> in 2024 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-is-handed-another-lawsuit-win-after-accused-switch-pirate-fails-to-plead">winning a legal case against the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit</a>.</p>
<p>It's not clear at this stage what might happen with nsw2u in the long run, but we'd wager that the site probably won't be coming back online anytime soon.</p>
<figure><a title="Site Seizure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b36b44021935d/site-seizure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: FBI</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding the Switch 2, it became clear soon after launch that those utilising MiG carts would be banned from online services on the console. This <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">drew the attention of Brazil's consumer rights watchdog</a>, who filed a complaint with Nintendo arguing that the latter's policy violates users' rights to access the services that they've paid for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The games industry is undergoing some radical changes, and the challenges it is facing are caused more by the dominance of Fortnite and other popular live service and forever games than subscription services like Xbox Games Pass, according to a well-known analyst.</p>



<p>Commenting on recent video game sales data, Circana (NPD) Executive Director and Video Games Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Mat Piscatella</a> mentioned how video game subscription spending in the United States reached an all-time high in May 2025 with $0.6 billion spent and achieving the third consecutive month of growth. The analyst speculates that the spending increase in subscription services could be related to inflation and general economic uncertainty, making users look for value, which a service like Xbox Game Pass definitely provides.</p>







<p>Replying to a user mentioning the narrative that subscription services are killing the video games industry, Mat Piscatella highlighted how top live service games like Fortnite are more of a threat to the industry than services like Xbox Game Pass. The top 10 live service games are sucking nearly half of all gaming hours from the PlayStation and Xbox ecosystems before any other game can even get a taste of their popularity, so much so that, in every presentation given, the analyst points out that the biggest competitor to any new game or service is Fortnite. Compared to what the Epic Games' title, Minecraft and Roblox are doing, nothing else really matters.</p>







<p>This isn't the first time this week that we have heard how competing with games like Fortnite will become increasingly difficult. <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-games-industry-is-facing-a-fundamental-realignment-june-2025/">A few days ago</a>, Square Enix's former Director of Business provided a rather in-depth analysis of the gaming industry's current state and how its transition to a social network of games phase is likely to shape its future.</p>

The PlayStation exclusive sold a whopping 2.4 million copies in its first three days on sale, with the most recent figures claiming lifetime sales of 13 million. Both a critical and financial success, obviously developers Sucker Punch immediately began work on a sequel, and some five years later we’re finally getting a good, long, detailed look at what the stealthy action-adventure follow-up has to offer.</p><figure id="" data-id="a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-recommend-id="image://a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1236" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-recommend-id="image://a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1236" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, this isn’t picking up where <em>Tsushima</em> left off. <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is a standalone sequel, set 329 years later, in 1603. This is an entirely new story, in a game all about revenge, main character Atsu returning 16 years after her whole family was murdered to kill the so-called Yōtei Six. And to really drive this home, the game will let you switch the world around you to Atsu’s childhood to contrast her before and after realities.</p><p>Once again, combat can be approached as you prefer, whether that’s melee sword battles, or ninja-like stealthy assassinations, or of course any mix of the two. And that sense of choice is, they claim, endemic throughout the game. As an open-world, the new footage explains you can mainline the central story, let yourself disappear off on extensive side-quests, or just explore the ridiculously pretty realm. However, the emphasis presented here is to take it slowly, no rush, “enjoy the ride.” And with those scenes of Atsu charging on horseback through the grasslands, seeds flying up around her, that does look like a rather lovely idea.</p><p>I really liked the extended trailer’s stressing that this isn’t a game about “honor,” about respecting the ancient traditions of this or that, but about a furious mercenary, willing to use dirty tricks and a shitty attitude to reach her goals. </p><p>Atsu will have access to a huge arsenal of slicey-choppy weapons, including a katana, spear, ōdachi (very long samurai sword), kusarigama (a brutal “chain-sickle”), and dual swords. And you can use these for broad third-person combat against crowds of foes, or sneaking up and silently taking people out. (If you’re playing this sort of game properly, that invariably means starting with the latter, then switching to the former when it all goes wrong.) And then there are bows and guns too, for ranged onslaughts. There’s also a bunch of rock, paper, scissors to it, as enemies switch weapons meaning you need to change up your response too.</p><figure id="" data-id="5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-recommend-id="image://5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-recommend-id="image://5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a whole bunch of bounties you take on, both plot-critical and side-quests, for which you’ll discover clues to track people down. Then there’s your “wolf pack,” a growing collection of allies who’ll help you out with new skills and equipment. And you’ve got all manner of dress-up options, including outfits specific to whether you want to focus on ranged, stealth or melee combat. All the things! So many things.</p><figure id="" data-id="ac3128aeb5b737b2022439e922feef55" data-recommend-id="image://ac3128aeb5b737b2022439e922feef55" data-format="jpg" data-width="1244" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three very silly costumes for Atsu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three very silly costumes for Atsu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac3128aeb5b737b2022439e922feef55" data-recommend-id="image://ac3128aeb5b737b2022439e922feef55" data-format="jpg" data-width="1244" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three very silly costumes for Atsu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As with the original game, there’s a fully Japanese version of the game, with subtitles, all as part of Sucker Punch’s effort to let the game feel like the samurai movies on which the games are based. They’ve also once more licensed the right to call a grainy black-and-white filter on the game “Kurosawa Mode,” which is, um, sure. Go for it. This is extended in <em>Yōtei </em>with the claimed “Miike Mode” to mean the camera is closer up in combat, with more mud and blood, and “Watanabe Mode” which will replace the game’s music with “lo-fi beats.” I mean, pretending that this is “partnering” with famous directors seems very silly to me, but I’m down for an ambient chill mode, as hilariously incongruous as it looked in the footage.</p><p>The game releases October 2, and damn, yeah, after this I’m very in. It looks fabulous, potentially out-Ubisofting Ubisoft in the open-world world. Let’s hope it meets these promises.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A popular Nintendo Switch piracy site has been seized by the FBI, as Nintendo continues its crackdown against piracy.</p>
<p>Nsw2u was a repository for Switch ROMs online, meaning players could download games without purchasing them to play on a hacked console or PC emulator. Now, as reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site has been taken down in accordance with a seizure warrant from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>
<p>Dutch agency the FIOD, which investigates financial crimes in the Netherlands, was also involved.</p>
<p>The site has been on the EU's piracy watchlist since May of this year, so was blocked by ISPs in several EU countries, as <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/eu-piracy-watchlist-adds-ipfs-fitgirl-and-njalla-250523/">TorrentFreak</a> reported. Now, when attempting to view the site, a notice reads: "This website has been seized".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo to clarify its role in seizing the piracy site.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo updated its policy against piracy</a> with a severe warning against "unauthorised use" that could result in consoles being bricked.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company has been heavily cracking down on piracy in recent years. Back in March, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">won a legal battle against a French file-sharing company</a> it described as "significant... for the entire games industry".</p>

            <p>Former RPS sealife correspondent Nate once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maneater-review">described the game Maneater</a> as "an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark", which stuck with me. The Jaws Effect is a reasonably well known phenomenon <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275954344_The_Jaws_Effect_How_movie_narratives_are_used_to_influence_policy_responses_to_shark_bites_in_Western_Australia">coined in a paper</a> that explores the impact the 1975 film had on Australian policy response to shark bites, although the term is now used a bit more broadly to refer to how sharks are villainised in pop culture - villainisation obviously being an absurdly human and dramatic concept to apply to a hungry or scared fish.</p>
<p>Jaws <a href="https://jeevoka.com/jaws-is-responsible-for-killing-a-colossal-amount-of-sharks/s">did actually result in an increase in shark culls</a>, but its lasting legacy has also been argued to be more insididous. Depending on whether you're looking at stats from the UN or from conservation charities, the number of sharks killed or mutilated and harvested each year for fins and other parts ranges between about 10 and 100 million, and it's been <a href="https://sharkstewards.org/how-jaws-influenced-shark-perception/">argued this continues</a> with relatively little pushback as compared to similar wildlife atrocities due to wide-reaching perception that ranges from apathy to vilification. A sharknado of lies, if you will.</p>

<p>It's a sort of reverse Finding Nemo effect - not the discredited idea that everyone rushed out and bought clownfish after seeing it, but the one that worker Sarah Wynn Williams writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People">in her book on Meta</a>, where a UN colleague in conversation tells her the Pixar films were the "single most impactful thing to actually protect the oceans over the last decade”. This is obviously a bit proverbial but the basic point that fictional media does stuff wot is also sometimes real should pretty much be a given by this point anyway.</p>
<p>All of which is the sort of shit that goes rushing through my head before I can get around to writing "lol look at the funny shark game". Even though, sure, the shark game <em>does</em> look funny. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shark-dentist">Shark Dentist</a> is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_Dentist">Crocodile Dentist </a>but with ray tracing and convincingly grimy teeth barnacles, set in an office that looks like the room from the first Saw film. The idea is you go poking around in a sedated shark's gumline and then act all shocked when it chomps your ears off.</p>
<p>Shark, quite famously, do not need the dentist because they're diligent flossers, and also because they replace their teeth frequently. This is fine. If this shark dentist was real they would be too stupid to live anyway, because they don't seem to have considered it might be prudent to bind the shark's jaws before getting in there with a buzzsaw. Here are some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3423280/Shark_Dentist">Steam</a> features:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Intense Gameplay:</strong> Treat a shark's teeth without waking it. Every mistake can lead to deadly consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Roguelike Mechanics:</strong> Randomly generated dental issues, tools, and debuffs make each attempt unique.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Monitor the shark's pulse, maintain oxygen supply, manage anesthesia, and choose the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Tool Interaction:</strong> Use syringes, drills, mirrors, and even a circular saw to tackle various tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Organic Balance:</strong> Manage the shark's stress level by finding a balance between the pain of treatment and limited resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's for "lovers of films like Jaws, The Meg, and Saw", which reminds me I never asked Nate about his feelings on The Meg combining two of his great loves - sealife and Jason Statham. I'll report back. Shark Dentist's release is TBC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shark-dentist-is-about-operating-on-a-fools-idea-of-a-shark]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's time to get totally radical, dudefolks. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the latest nostalgia-fest about avian athletes artfully acing acrobatic boardiness, drops in full today, July 11th. Though, thanks to pre-order early access meaning the game sort of released three days ago, its modding community is already off and running.</p>
<p>If you've spent the past few months watching old X Games reruns and thinking to yourself that all the shreddage might be better if Bob Burnqvist were an Edwardian nanny, a train chaser, or a gabagool enthusiast, I've got some good news.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a glance at what THPS 3+4's Nexus Mods page has to offer as of this fine Friday, the answer is an awful lot of character skins swaps from modder Huckleberrypie, who's got a long and illustrious history of sticking different models into games. Here's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/barbieandthe12dancingprincesses/mods/3">Terry Honk</a> as the main character of Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses, a video game I had no idea existed until this morning.</p>
<p>They've clearly been working hard throughout these few early access days. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/11">Tommy Angelo</a> from the Mafia games, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/10">Tony Soprano</a> from the mafia game that was also a TV show, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/5">Snow White</a> from the Dwarven mafia, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/4">Elsa</a> from Frozen, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/3">the obligatory CJ</a> from GTA San Andreas - they're all here, swapped in for the Birdman and Brazilian prodigy Rayssa Leal while modders work out how to pull off standalone character additions.</p>
<p>For some reason, though, I can't take my eyes off one particular Huckleberrypie creation. It's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/12">Mary Poppins</a> from the 2018 film Mary Poppins Returns, which I haven't seen, but assume involves Mary Poppins coming back to force everyone to remember how to spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</p>

<p>Along with the above video of Mary shredding the supercalifuck out of a park run, the modder's penned a backstory to explain her journey to skating superstardom. "Years after the events of the first film, Mary Poppins comes to the Bankses' aid when Michael's wife passed away and his family fell in dire straits due to the depression," it reads, "Mary clearly needed a break from all the turmoil her charges went through, and so she turned to her hobby of performing rock music and tearing up the park with her trusty skateboard."
</p>
<p>I don't care if it's the exact same narrative Huckleberrypie weaved for one of their multiple <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater1and2/mods/102">THPS 1+2 Mary Popins mods</a>, it's moving stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other mods on offer for 3+4 on release include a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/1">port of a 1+2 mod</a> that adds the likes of custom restarts and a free roam cam. Plus, there's the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/2">quick startup</a> for folks who can't stand three seconds of logo splashes. Oh, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/7">Master Chief</a> skating on a mini-tank.</p>
<p>Do you think Mary would have hit the 900 before Tony Hawk in real life, if she weren't a fictional character? I do, and if you disagree, you're just wrong.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-drops-in-full-today-so-of-course-a-modder-already-has-mary-poppins-poppin-kickflips]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">An also-ran with a winning attitude.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby, the Japanese mobile game in which you raise anime horse-girls, has brought Japan’s most unsuccessful racehorse a second boom in popularity following its western launch on Steam — with her positive, never-give-up attitude inspiring a whole new set of fans overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cygames’ Umamusume: Pretty Derby franchise centers around a cast of anime girls with horse ears and tails. Each one is based on a real racehorse, with the personalities, designs and stats of each character reflecting their IRL counterparts. With the 2021 free-to-play mobile game finally getting its English-language debut this June on Steam, more international fans have been discovering the charms of Umamusume’s characters.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/image007-1752223496532.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby has enjoyed a successful launch in the west via Steam.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pink-haired Haru Urara seems to have struck a particular chord with some players. To say she has a bubbly, positive, can-do attitude would be an understatement. Even though she often loses races, she is good friends with the other horse-girls and often buys them souvenirs. Like Umamusume’s other characters, plucky Haru Urara is based on the real life horse of the same name, who is now 29-years-old and enjoying her retirement at <a href="https://www.matha-farm.com/%E9%A6%AC%E3%81%AE%E7%B4%B9%E4%BB%8B/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matha Farm</u></a> in Japan’s Chiba Prefecture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone loves an underdog, or an underhorse in this case. Haru Urara raced from 1998 to 2004, however she didn’t win a single one of her 113 races. Although she made it to second and third place a handful of times, she spent most of her career literally lagging behind (source: <a href="https://www.jbis.jp/horse/0000307965/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JBIS Search</u></a>). So much so that she became famous for losing, becoming a kind of national symbol of perseverance in the face of adversity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/gettyimages-154598960-1752223029427.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yutaka Take riding Haru Urara in 2004. Photo by Sports Nippon/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2004, Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister at the time, even praised her in his <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/m-magazine/backnumber/koizumi/2004/0325.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official email magazine</u></a>, saying: “I believe that Haru Urara's attitude of not giving up despite being beaten race after race is one that is clearly an inspiration for us all.” In her last years of racing a “Haru Boom” was underway (source: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/losing-racehorse-charms-japan/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CBS News</u></a>), with fans travelling across the country to watch her lose races and buying up Haru Urara merch. Even the betting slips with her name on were being used as charms to ward against traffic accidents (the word “<em>ataranai</em>” or “didn’t win” stamped on losing betting slips is a homonym for not being hit, by a car for example). In 2018, Haru Urara became a local celebrity again when she was featured on Chiba police’s traffic safety posters, getting paid 600kg worth of carrots (source: <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20180822-RPWWJE7OAVJCFL6YLXXVVS6TIQ/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sankei News</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to July 2025, and users posting real life Haru Urara content on X noticed a sudden uptick of likes and follows, likely the Umamusume effect in action. X user animal_love_kaz, a self-confessed fan of retired racehorses who frequently posts photos and updates noted that their Haru Urara birthday post suddenly got thousands more likes overnight, with their overseas account gaining 400 new followers. In a <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1940610702202511743" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>July 3 post, below,</u></a> featuring a photo of the horse with a flower on her head that has since racked up 2.6 million views, animal_love_kaz wrote: "I don’t know if this will reach my overseas bros and sisters but Haru Urara is very well, in fact, she’s probably healthier and more energetic than me!"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">なぜかウララさんの今年の誕生日の時のティアラのが昨日からまた更に1万くらいイイネが増えてて通知止まらんし海外アカで昨日から400人くらいフォロワー増えてるじゃん<br>海外ニキネキ達に伝わるかわからないけど、ハルウララさんはとても元気で過ごしてるし、むしろ私より健康で元気なくらいだよ😆👍 <a href="https://t.co/E9MKbUaPRj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/E9MKbUaPRj</a></p>— もつご (@animal_love_kaz) <a href="https://twitter.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1940610702202511743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume’s Haru Urara has even been co-opted into the “Why don’t you ever give up?” “Because she never did!” meme, which is now floating around a social media comment thread near you (here it is on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tamanpermainan/comments/1lpuun7/the_horse_that_inspires_people_to_never_give_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a>). It seems that Haru Urara has become a symbol of not giving up in the face of adversity for a whole new group of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In-game Haru Urara naturally doesn’t have the best stats compared to other characters. However players can take on the challenge of trying to make her a winner in the game, or at the very least, just enjoy her infectious positive attitude in the Story Mode cutscenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Haru Urara is also a reminder that if your career isn't working out right now, you may find success in another field (pun intended) later on. Although Haru Urara was not successful as a racehorse, she is now gaining popularity on social media, and living out her retirement years with her friend Pepper the goat. Matha Farms even has <a href="https://suzuri.jp/Matha-Farm/products" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official merch</u></a> featuring her, from T-shirts to cushion covers and phone straps. Some fans visit her, but with the surge in popularity of these real life racehorses, Umamusume developer Cygames recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-dev-reminds-fans-to-follow-the-rules-when-visiting-the-real-life-japanese-racehorses-behind-their-favorite-anime-horse-girls"><u>shared guidelines on how to respectfully meet your horsey idols in real life</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mobile game Umamusume: Pretty Derby is available now in English via Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App store.
