            <p>
Fans of Konami's original Silent Hill 2 have been sceptical of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s forthcoming remake, but its CEO Piotr Babieno has called for fans to trust the studio.
</p>
<p>
Bloober is known for developing psychological horror games, but despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-is-excited-and-very-confident">its confidence in the remake</a> fans have been less forgiving in their criticism of trailers shown so far.

</p>
<p>
"I am dreaming that gamers will trust us," Babieno told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/bloober-teams-piotr-babieno-talks-silent-hill-2-criticisms-1235061338/">Rolling Stone</a>, "but I realise that trust is earned through actions, not through words. So that's why we have a policy of not commenting [on the specifics of the game] and raising hopes. We want to show our ambitions through our work, so we can't ask for anything more than 'give us a chance.'"

<p>
Babieno is sympathetic to the importance of the game to fans of the series. He too is a fan, stating playing the game "changed [his] life".
</p>
<p>
"Despite technological progress [in video games]," he said, "so many of us remember [visiting] the town of Silent Hill as one of the most important points in our lives."
</p>
<p>The original game released on the PS2 back in 2001 and has proven iconic for its Pyramid Head and nurse enemies.</p>
<p>
Thanks to conversations between Bloober and Konami, "we found a great balance of what we and our partner had in mind," said Babieno. "It took us a long time to get there, with a lot of creative discussions and hard work, but we are very happy with the result."
</p>
<p>
Constructive criticism from fans has been taken into account, which so far has been "invaluable in refining our project before its release", though the studio's developers also focus "on their creative work with peace of mind" by shutting out other voices.
</p>
<p>
"We tried to make all possible fans happy, but, at the same time, be very faithful to ourselves," said Babieno. "I really hope that when people play for the first time, they will understand that the choices we made were the best possible."
</p>
<p>
Further, work on Silent Hill 2 is ushering in a new era for the studio as it moves towards delivering horror through action and not just the psychological horror and environmental storytelling it's become known for.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill 2 will therefore function as "a culmination of my work, but, at the same time, a gateway to the new," said Babieno.
</p>
<p>
The remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2 is set for release</a> on PS5 and PC in October, as revealed at Sony's State of Play in May with a new trailer (see above).

            <p>Cinematic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bionic-bay">Bionic Bay</a> opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason <a href="https://x.com/JuhanaMyllys/status/1820138628447707617">Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week</a>. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.</p>

<p>Your guy is much more athletic the average hapless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a> trundler, able to pull of leaping aerial rolls, huge dives, and massive jumps. You’ll need them, too. Laser beams, exploding barrels, and other hazards are rife. It’s much closer to a traditional platformer in this sense, but checkpoints are very frequent. Also, your dude has some powerful ragdoll going on, so it’s also just very entertaining to watch him get blasted across the screen into walls. Soon, you’ll get a little gizmo that lets you swap places with environmental objects, opening the game up to clever traversal puzzles.</p>
<p>It’s also just very creative with its challenges. On one screen, you’ll be timing rolls to match a steam vent's emissions of searing liquid that would otherwise melt you. On the next, you’ll be hoisting yourself up on what look like stars sparkling through a crimson nebula. It very much nails the cinematic platformer feel of being a bumbling little dude, very out of your depth at all times.</p>
<p>In that Xitter clip I shared up top, the artist shows off the incredible amount of work that went into that single tree trunk, then shares a clip of the player character sprinting past the trunk in a few seconds. To pour this much work into something so many won’t notice is madness, which is to say it’s the sort of deeply human expression of artistry that keeps me getting up every morning to write about games.

This week sees the release of a new Steam edition of Type-Moon and Kinoko Nasu's dark fantasy visual novel and dating sim Fate Stay/Night. I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

<span>「Fate/stay night REMASTERED」Release Announcement PV</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IeHShG5Bv-8?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IeHShG5Bv-8?autoplay=1">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeHShG5Bv-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Originally released in 2004, Stay/Night is the tale of Shirou Emiya, a schoolboy with the obligatory buried hero complex who gets himself embroiled in a war between mages for the Holy Grail. The mages do battle by summoning legendary heroes to duel on their behalf. Shirou somehow manages to pair off with one of the elites - Saber, aka Artoria Pendragon, a blonde-bobbed, gender-flipped King Arthur. 
</p>
<p>
Saber is absolutely ubiquitous within the Fate universe and beyond. Even if you haven't watched, played or read anything Fate-related, you will likely have come across a homage to the character, aka "saberface", in some other anime or manga. You will also likely have encountered a reference to Shirou's schoolfriend Rin Tohsaka, often referred to as the original twin-tail tsundere (a tsundere is a character, generally a girl, who shows affection towards the main character by being abrasive and standoffish).
</p>
<p>
If Saber is the heart of the series, Fate doesn't want for alternative poster children. Period celebs in Stay Night include a flashy take on Irish mythological hero Cu Chulainn whose tendency to get himself killed off is a running franchise joke, and a repulsive, lecherous interpretation of Sumerian king Gilgamesh. As the "first hero in history", Gilgamesh claims ownership of the legendary weapons wielded by every other hero, and is fond of firing those weapons out of a massive golden portal. He'd do well in Total War.
</p>
<p>
Gilgamesh might be an arsehole, but he is certainly a source of spectacle. When Fate heroes fight, it's an absolute bloodbath, especially when it comes to Ufotable's Unlimited Bladeworks adaptations - aka, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxrebii_44">Unlimited Budgetworks</a>. These see heroes lobbing castles at each other and performing magic attacks that make Final Fantasy summons look like flicked rubberbands. Later Fate stories like the multiple-period Grand Order series spice things up by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pApAiZymeu0">introducing full-on gods and goddesses</a>. That said, the bulk of Fate Stay/Night is about conversation. There's the opportunity to romance Saber, Rin or their extremely hard-done-by schoolmate, Sakura, and each of these romance plotlines broadly corresponds to a different ending for the overarching battle royale plot.
</p>
<p>
Stay/Night isn't a laidback play. It's extremely easy to make the wrong call and perish without warning - you are, after all, a puny human who has fallen in with various juggernauts from the ancient world. The narratives can be very disturbing - the Heaven's Feel plot path, in particular, is a ghoulish history of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The original game also features some extremely cheesy, male-gazey sex scenes, but these have been removed from the Steam remaster (which is based on the intervening, non-adult Realta Nua adaptation). If the violence is too much, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62c7_zKoSV8">the Carnival Phantasm parodies</a> are a nice, if deeply discombobulating introduction to the fundamental idiocy of a series in which Shakespeare gets to bandy words with Hercules and Jack The Ripper. There's also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKgbWm4GWQ">a cosy Fate cooking show</a>, in which Saber, Shirou and co bond over omurice and curry. I'm pretty sure there's a Fate-themed everything, at this stage.
</p>
<p>The new edition of Fate Stay/Night is out on Thursday 8th August, and will be available in English, Japanese and Simplified Chinese. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396980/Fatestay_night_REMASTERED/">Here's the Steam page</a>. I will leave you with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he4D3NzNJss">Berser-CAR</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Inflexion Games, the studio behind gaslamp fantasy survival game Nightingale, is "not satisfied with where the game is at".
</p>
<p>
That's according to CEO Aaryn Flynn, who spoke alongside art and audio director Neil Thomson in a particularly candid video discussing what's next for the early access game.
</p>
<p>
Since its release into early access six months ago, Inflexion has focused on quality of life changes, bug fixes, and adding in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-introduces-highly-requested-offline-mode-in-new-early-access-update">much-requested offline mode</a>. Now, the team is looking to better fulfil its original vision and address shortcomings to the experience.

<p>

"We are not satisfied with where the game is at, we're not satisfied with the overall sentiment, we're not satisfied with our player numbers," admitted Flynn.
</p>
<p>
While the game has an all-time peak of 47,500 concurrent players, it's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1928980/charts/">currently peaking</a> at just a couple of hundred players each day.
</p>
<p>
Now the team is debating what's core to the game and what it's comfortable adjusting.
</p>
<p>
To that end, a big update is planned for the end of summer. One major change is adding more structure and clearer progression, as the pair admit the game is currently too open-ended and requires players to be self-motivated in setting goals. 
</p>
<p>
Higher build limits are also on the way, allowing players to create larger and more complex structures, as well as more variety in its fantastical realms. Central to the experience is the sense of adventure, so the team is keen to fulfil that promise.
</p>
<p>
Further, the pair thanked the community for its support and noted that all positive and constructive feedback is welcomed.
</p>
<p>
Our Bertie was disappointed with the game after release, noting the fun is always "just around the corner".
</p>
<p>
"Mostly, I've been in dogged pursuit of an excitement that eludes me, hoping it'll be around the next corner I turn, in the next gear tier I unlock," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-nightingale-the-fun-is-always-just-around-the-corner">Nightingale impressions</a>. "But every corner seems to just bring another corner, and so around and around I go, getting somewhere but never there."

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is out relatively soon and looks relatively exciting, if you're into Ubisoft open worlds and pseudo-Uncharted mechanics with pewpews and dribbly aliens. And if you're excited, prepare to get more excited-er - or more exhausted-er - as Ubi have just unveiled Outlaws' DLC plans for season pass holders. Those DLCs will let you meet "notorious gambler" Lando Calrissian and "veteran pirate" Hondo Ohnaka, who I am definitely familiar with.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game launches on August 30th and both DLCs will be released after the fact. The first DLC entitled "Wild Card" arrives sometime in Fall of this year, while the second "A Pirate's Fortune" drops sometime in Spring of 2025.</p>
<p>In Wild Card, you'll get embroiled in a "high-stakes Sabacc tournament" where you'll meet Lando, who is a legendary gambler and not home to Ornstein and Smough, or those archers who knock you off those pissing rooftops. And in A Pirate's Fortune, you'll meet Hondo "who is looking to settle old scores with a ruthless gang of pirates", and is not a vehicle with a manual transmission, or an old western flick featuring John Wayne.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SWO_Seasonpass_Roadmap.png?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now here comes the painful bit. To get access to either of these DLCs, you'll need to purchase a version of the game that comes bundled with the season pass. Right now, it doesn't look like you can purchase the season pass separately… which is dastardly. What this means then, is that if you want both of these DLC packs, you'll need to buy the Gold Edition for £95 or the Ultimate Edition for £115 (for reference, the base game costs £60). Subscribe to Ubisoft+ for £15 a month and it'll grant you access, too. Goodness me, those prices.</p>
<p>Edwin tried Star Wars Outlaws at this year's Geoff Fest and thought it felt about as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-feels-about-as-han-solo-ish-as-well-an-ubisoft-open-world-game">Han Solo-ish as, well, an Ubisoft open world game</a>. "Again, I think all of this will probably add up into somebody's idea of a good time, specifically a Star Warrior who's not played any Ubisoft games for a while," he wrote. "Bland and unwilling as the mechanics can be, they're an adequate delivery mechanism for the setting."</p>
<p>For more on those prices and a few extra bits on the season pass, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws">site</a> has the details. Otherwise, you can follow Star Wars Outlaws over on Ubisoft's <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3oDeg1rH3qrXBttnBaxN5Y/star-wars-outlaws-postlaunch-roadmap-revealed">site</a> as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-designed-pc-compatibility/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation VR2 was designed with PC-compatibility in mind from the very beginning, SIE confirmed in a new short interview.</p>
<p>As confirmed to Japanese outlet <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/review/minireview/1614016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AV Watch</a>, the importance of PC compatibility was known within the headset's development team, and was taken into consideration during its design phase. Once the PlayStation VR2 was out, the team first worked on optimizing the VR experience on PlayStation 5, and then went on to develop PC compatibility, which is finally coming this week with the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-system-requirements/">adapter.</a></p>
<p>Besides asking the three questions to an SIE representative, AV Watch also discussed how the PlayStation VR2 headset works on PC. According to the reviewer, the headset is good enough for a PC VR headset but not the best, mostly due to some issues regarding its sweet post and the general image quality.</p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will launch tomorrow, August 7th, worldwide. You can learn more about the headset by reading Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With a pricetag befitting of next-generation hardware, the PSVR2 headset offers a virtual reality experience that's unique to the PlayStation 5 ecosystem. Only time will tell if the new technology is worth the investment but all of the design changes and new features make me excited for what's to come in the future for PlayStation VR2.</em></p>

<p>A new leak claims that Fortnite’s battle royale will feature a Fall Guys mini-game in the middle of the match.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by reliable Fortnite leaker Hypex, Fortnite’s Fall Guys collaboration will soon feature a mini-game in the middle of battle royale matches. Players can join this mini-game to obtain Epic and Legendary loot for use in the Battle Royale map. The mini-game will work similarly to the Mothership mini-game that players saw during Chapter 2, Season 7, it was claimed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will find Fall Guys <a href="https://x.com/McMistrzYT/status/1820748712454324280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statutes</a> spread across the Fortnite Battle Royale map. Players interacting with these statues will be transformed into the ‘Fall Guys beans’ and teleported to a Fall Guys map. Check out the leaked screenshots of Fall Guys mini-game maps in the post embedded below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fall Guys has already arrived in Fortnite through UEFN and Creative Mode. This new collaboration allows players to create Fall-Guys-themed islands for Fortnite, and some of these creations can be featured in the actual game.

    <div>
        

        <p>But still turns a profit following restructure.</p>

            <p>
Sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> games have dropped compared to last year, despite the high profile release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>.
</p>
<p>
According to its latest earnings report, the company's overall net sales dropped by 18.4 percent year-on-year for the most recent quarter. 
</p>
<p>
This is driven in part due to a decline in sales of new games. By comparison, the same quarter in 2023 saw the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

</figure>
<p>
However, the company has still turned a profit with its games this year on lower development cost amortisation and advertising expenses.
</p>
<p>
What's more, its MMO sub-segment saw a rise in sales and profits compared to last year. This latest quarter does not include the July release of Final Fantasy 14 expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a>, though clearly interest has risen ahead of its release. Expect a considerable boost to profits in the next quarterly results.
</p>
<p>
Mobile games, meanwhile, have also seen sales decline "due to weak sales of existing titles", presumably including last year's release of free-to-play gacha game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-turns-square-enixs-best-into-an-avalanche-of-money-grabbing-tactics">Final Fantasy 7 Ever Crisis</a>. However, profits have increased due to "optimisation of operational expenses".

</p>
<p>
Overall, Square Enix is "continuing determined efforts to strengthen the competitiveness and profitability" of its business.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the year, company president Takashi Kiryu announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of the company's development system</a>, to boost quality and profits. 

</p>
<p>
As part of this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">company abandoned £112m of in-development projects</a> that resulted in a loss for the previous financial year. It's now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>.


</p>
<p>
It's clear, then, Square Enix is in a reset phase and its restructuring has resulted in a profit despite disappointing sales of its existing games.
</p>
<p>
The company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">laid off staff in its US and European offices</a> as part of "structural reforms".

</p>
<p>
Sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth were not specifically included in this financial report, though previously it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">reported sales were "underperforming"</a>. 

</p>
<p>
The third and final part of that trilogy is yet to be fully revealed or a release window provided, but director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed the popular card game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-finale-will-receive-revamped-queens-blood-card-game">Queen's Blood will make a "revamped" return</a>.

			<p>Black Myth Wukong, the action role-playing game developed by Game Science, has gone gold today and will be released as scheduled later this month.</p>
<p>The development studio itself confirmed the news with a message on <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1820649285450649680">X/Twitter</a>, adding that the entire team is working hard on the final stages of <em>"experiencing, testing and deploying the game."</em> Before the game launches on August 20th on PC and PlayStation 5, the studio will give another look at Black Myth Wukong with a new trailer that will be shared later this week, on August 8th, at 10 am Beijing time. 10 am will also be the time the game will unlock on all platforms it releases, which include Steam, the Epic Games Store, and PlayStation 5 in the West.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong was also supposed to be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S later this month, but the game was delayed on Microsoft's consoles to allow the developer to better optimize the game on these platforms, although the delay may also have been caused by some sort of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-on-xbox-black-myth-wukong-delays-doesnt-want-to-comment-on-possible-exclusivity-deals-from-rivals/">deal</a> with Sony. Unfortunately, a new release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20th. The game will also launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on a yet to be confirmed release date.</p>

            <p>
The remake of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw will now arrive a couple of weeks earlier, on 12th September here in Europe and in America. 
</p>
<p>
Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, as this new version is titled, was previously announced as launching on 26th September, for Nintendo Switch, PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
After some initial confusion, developer Dragami Games has now made clear that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zombie-hack-and-slash-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-gets-september-release-date">RePop is a remaster of the original game</a> by Grasshopper Manufacture, first launched in 2012, and not a full-on remake. 
</p>
<p>
A surprisingly fun hack-and-chainsaw zombie game, it was the brainchild of No More Heroes' Suda51, with a script penned in part by James Gunn - before his days in the superhero space.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update！Release date of LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP（Digital）is September 12 in North America,Central and South America, and Europe.<br>And the retail price has been confirmed $44.99.… <a href="https://t.co/NoNaYXVGpg">pic.twitter.com/NoNaYXVGpg</a></p>— 安田善巳 Yoshimi Yasuda (@yasudaD5) <a href="https://twitter.com/yasudaD5/status/1820610762534244625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Dragami has said this new version should replicate the original Lollipop Chainsaw as closely as possible - though will sadly not include the game's licensed music soundtrack. 
</p>
<p>Eurogamer gave the original a mixed write-up when it first landed:</p>
<p>"Grasshopper's latest really is a bit of a lollipop: it's sugary, colourful, insubstantial - and perhaps a bit sickly with it," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lollipop-chainsaw-review">Eurogamer's Lollipop Chainsaw review</a>. "It all makes for an oddball game that struggles to be odd in the right way."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular Fortnite leaks sources ShiinaBR have revealed that some new Dragon Ball Z and X-Men characters are soon arriving in the Item Shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR posted two tweets today about future collaborations. The first one revealed new Dragon Ball Z skins for Fortnite, this time from the Android Saga, which will feature Android 17 and Android 18. Shiina added in a <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1820742996477784139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later tweet</a> that these skins and their respective backblings should be available for purchase from August 10. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While revealing the Dragon Ball Z skins, the Fortnite leaker also leaked upcoming skins from the X-Men franchise. The latest X-Men characters coming to Fortnite include Cyclops, Jubilee and Colossus. All of these characters have their specific backblings and pickaxes too. Similar to the Dragon Ball-Z skins, the X-Men skins are also encrypted, so for now players will need to wait to see the items in their ‘showcase’ state (in-game).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dragon Ball Z and X-Men are not new collaborations for Fortnite, and we have received several characters from these two franchises in the past. Regarding Dragon Ball Z, we already have skins like Goku, Vegeta, Goku Black, Beerus, Frieza, Cell, Bulma, Gohan, and Piccolo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With X-Men, there are a similar number of skins in Fortnite for the franchise, including characters like Wolverine, Deadpool, Rogue, Gambit, Mystique, Dark Phoenix, Magneto, Cable, Domino, Storm and Psylocke. Some of these characters have additional variants, too.</p>

Also, a recent leak claimed that more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-claims-creative-mode-could-add-collab-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration items could arrive for Creative Mode</a>.

            <p>
Chatty gun game High on Life is set to be turned into an animated TV series, with Curb Your Own Enthusiasm's JB Smoove signed on as producer. 
</p>
<p>
Smoove starred in High on Life game as Gus, one of the game's talking fish/guns, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/j-b-smoove-produce-star-series-high-on-life-video-game-1236031133/">Deadline</a> reports there's a "good chance" he'll reprise the role in the upcoming animated series as well as producing the project.
</p>
<p>
High on Life launched in December 2022 for PC and Xbox and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-is-now-the-most-popular-thing-on-xbox-game-pass">was the year's biggest launch on Xbox Game Pass</a>, but proved controversial even before release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-contains-ai-art-and-voice-acting">it emerged the game included AI art and voice acting</a>.

Just weeks after High on Life launched, Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland - co-founder of the game's development studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a> - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-high-on-life-creator-justin-roiland-charged-with-domestic-violence">charged with domestic violence</a> (charges which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-high-on-life-creator-finally-responds-to-allegations">later dropped due to "insufficient evidence"</a>). Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-co-creator-departs-high-on-life-studio-he-founded-following-allegations">Roiland departed Squanch and was fired from Rick and Morty by Cartoon Network</a>.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-is-now-available-on-playstation-4-and-5">PlayStation version of High on Life</a> launched in the summer of 2023 for PS4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
Smoove is now working with Squanch and his own production company, Alternate Side Productions, to adapt the property into a Rick and Morty-style series.
</p>
<p>
"When Squanch Games originally reached out to JB Smoove (I like to talk about myself in the third person) about voicing a character in their incredible video game High On Life, my first question was what does my character look like? They told me that I would be a fish that shoots... which makes perfect sense to me! As a vegan I feel a fish should have the right to defend itself! I mean right?!" Smoove said. 
</p>
<p>
"And now that I'm partnered with Squanch Games and Striker Entertainment to bring the hilarious High On Life to series it feels like it was inevitable! They invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I'm helping them move into the TV world! It's a case of a game recognising game! High on Life is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more! Get ready to laugh your way through space with some unforgettable characters like myself! We are locked and loaded and ready to go!"
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer was less a fan of High on Life in its review.
</p>
<p>
"A miserable cocktail of ideas from other action-platformers and the worst parts of Rick and Morty," Edwin Evans-Thirlwell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-review-a-mediocre-shooter-with-an-unfunny-attitude-problem">Eurogamer's High on Life review</a>, dubbing it "a mediocre shooter with an unfunny attitude problem".

<p>Black Ops 6 is fast becoming one of the most-leaked Call of Duty games ever. In recent days, we’ve seen full multiplayer matches uploaded to YouTube, streams appear on TikTok, and even a PS4 build of the game has appeared online. Everything from perks to weapons and from movement mechanics to multiplayer maps has been exposed online for all to see.</p>



<p>Activision Blizzard is trying to keep pace with DMCA strikes and takedown notices, but at the moment, it’s like fighting a wildfire with a water pistol.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-months-in-advance">Months In Advance</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 isn’t due to be released until October 25, 2024. However, scores of content have been released online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcasing the game’s multiplayer</a> platform and everything you’d need to know about it more than three months in advance. </p>



<p>While the multiplayer offering has been plastered online for all to see, little has been revealed regarding the single-player portion of the game or the new Zombies mode.</p>



<p>Most recently, an unfinished, mid-development build of the game was released to repositories online, giving players unparalleled access to an early version of the upcoming first-person shooter. It was arguably the most devastating point in the line of Black Ops 6 leaks that have wormed their way onto social media in recent days.</p>



<p>Toward the end of August, Activision is hosting Call of Duty NEXT, a showcase designed to reveal the future of the ecosystem – and it’s also when the first multiplayer reveal will take place. Unfortunately, the only edge the team will have over the leaks is that the version of the game they’re showing will be much more polished.</p>



<p>Even Warzone hasn’t proven immune to the Black Ops 6 leaks – recently, the ‘2025 map’ known internally as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-new-map-avalon-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avalon was revealed</a> in full.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/jb-smoove-high-on-life-animated/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jb-smoove-set-to-produce-%E2%80%98high-on-life%E2%80%99-animated-show.945528/</guid>

<p>It was recently reported that JB Smoove is on board to produce and potentially star in an animated show set in the universe established in 2022’s High on Life. The quirky, bizarre first-person shooter was released last year to a positive reception, and since it dropped, many have commented on the game’s potential to be converted into an animated series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perfect-for-television">Perfect For Television</h2>



<p>High on Life is an original and entertaining title with a unique story that sees players battle all types of alien lifeforms in a fight to stop humans from being consumed as a potent drug. It’s a humorous and satirical title with ‘Rick and Morty-like’ funnies written into it. </p>



<p>One of the more kooky elements of the game is that all the player’s weapons are sentient lifeforms themselves, each with a unique personality and the ability to influence the player’s actions.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/j-b-smoove-produce-star-series-high-on-life-video-game-1236031133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by Deadline</a>, JB Smoove is set to produce an animated adaptation of High of Life, working side-by-side with Russell Binder, Mandy Bardisbanian, and Alec Robbins, who worked as the narrative director on the 2022 game. </p>



<p>In a statement, Smoove said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that I’m partnered with Squanch Games and Striker Entertainment to bring the hilarious High On Life to series it feels like it was inevitable!&nbsp;They invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I’m helping them move into the TV world! It’s a case of a game recognizing game!&nbsp;<em>High on Life</em>&nbsp;is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent years, the concept of the live-action adaptation has blossomed immeasurably, and that naturally extends to animated adaptations, too. Earlier this year, we saw Fallout released on Prime Video to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and before that, The Last of Us scooped Emmy Awards for the first season of the show that debuted in 2023.</p>

<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP, the highly anticipated remaster of the 2012 zombie slasher, was set to be released globally on September 26. However, Dragami Games has just announced that it’ll drop earlier in several markets, arriving <strong>digitally </strong>on September 12. The team also confirmed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will cost $44.99 (or the local equivalent).</p>



<p>It’s dropping on September 12 in NA, EU, and Central and South America.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-ready-for-repop">Get Ready for RePOP</h2>



<p>In 2012, Lollipop Chainsaw was released to a relatively positive reception. It had a punchy soundtrack, flashy visuals, and a typically attractive female lead running around in a cheerleader’s outfit while wielding a massive chainsaw – instant win, right?</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update！Release date of LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP（Digital）is September 12 in North America,Central and South America, and Europe.<br>And the retail price has been confirmed $44.99.… <a href="https://t.co/NoNaYXVGpg">pic.twitter.com/NoNaYXVGpg</a></p>— 安田善巳 Yoshimi Yasuda (@yasudaD5) <a href="https://twitter.com/yasudaD5/status/1820610762534244625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s not the game everyone expected to be remastered, but there’s no reason why it <strong>shouldn’t </strong>have been. It was entertaining enough more than a decade ago to provide a few hours of mindless entertainment as players were charged with slashing through hordes of zombies, so why wouldn’t it be just as entertaining today?</p>



<p>In a similar vein, gamers worldwide are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, which will be released just one week after Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP, giving players everywhere the opportunity to embark on a nostalgia-filled journey that takes them back to the days of the Xbox 360.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-release-date-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>UFL, which has been dubbed the ‘FIFA/FC killer’, is set to be released on September 12. Following a few successful test runs, which saw more than 1.5 million downloads recorded during the first beta weekend, UFL is ready and raring to go.</p>



<p>Building on community feedback from the previous beta tests, Strikerz Inc. was able to make significant improvements to the game ahead of the most recent testing period that ran from August 2 – 4 and in little more than a month, the full (free) game will be released for everyone to enjoy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keeping-it-fair">Keeping It Fair</h2>



<p>At the heart of UFL sits the claim that the game is ‘fair-to-play’ and that it prioritises skill over spending. It’s an ambitious and realistic title that rewards strategy and it has already proven to be a hit with fans worldwide. This single- and multiplayer game boasts cross-platform functionality, create-a-club mechanics, and some of the most impressive visuals we’ve seen in a debut sports game for years.</p>



<p>If you need any more convincing that great things are in store for UFL, consider that Cristiano Ronaldo invested heavily in the game during a fundraising round that pulled in $40 million. Not only that, but the likes of Firmino and De Bruyne have signed on as ambassadors.</p>



<p>Strikerz Inc. has a lofty goal in sight: 15 million players within 12 months. It has already been confirmed it’ll be free to play <strong>but </strong>it will of course have a battle pass system and microtransactions woven into it.</p>



<p>Will you be downloading and playing UFL when it’s released on September 12?</p>

                <p>Even though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is still a couple of months away, leaks have begun making their way online. The latest one showcases how the meat shield mechanic looks when performed on another player.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever players sneak up behind another enemy, they can use them as a human meat shield instead of automatically performing an execution on them. As shown in a clip by<a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1820554144324927648?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow "> Charlie Intel on X/Twitter</a>, when using someone as a meat shield, the player will pull out their pistol and use that to defend themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Once players have someone, they can also kill them. Players will be able to perform a "Quick Kill" which presumably means they'll die right away, and they'll also have the opportunity to perform their execution.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on what the clip provides, it appears that the meat shields will still be alive during this. But if the person using them as a shield dies before them, the other player will resume playing. So you can still potentially save teammates if you aim your shots right.</p><p dir="ltr">As previously mentioned, various leaks around Black Ops 6 have made their way online. The reason is that a<a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1820567152996519980?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow "> version of the game was uploaded to the PSN database</a>, which allowed people to play a beta build on the PlayStation 4. So, if you want to avoid spoiling certain features for yourself, avoid looking up specific Call of Duty content for the time being.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is scheduled to come out later this year on October 25. It'll be playable on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

Tim Burton is back directing the follow-up alongside new and original cast members like Keaton and Winona Ryder. And one of these new actors, Jenny Ortega, was selected to share some depressing news: Beetlejuice is coming to <em>Roblox</em>. </p><p>Announced today, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.roblox.com/games/17811071580/BEETLEJUICE-Escape-the-Afterlife&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/17811071580/BEETLEJUICE-Escape-the-Afterlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice Roblox</em> experience is live now</a></span>. Players can hop in and play a few mini-games, unlock in-game content for their Roblox character, and explore a digital landscape inspired by the upcoming film. And yes, you can hang out with Beetlejuice, who looks like a demented knock-off mini-fig based on a kid’s cartoon drawing of the famous character. But this is just what <em>Roblox </em>looks like to me any time I’m forced against my will to learn more about this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-gambling-robux-lawsuit-metaverse-court-kid-safe-1850751687&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-gambling-robux-lawsuit-metaverse-court-kid-safe-1850751687">horrible game filled with shady people, scam artists, and probably some actual kids</a></span>. </p><p>For those who want to get nuts (editor’s note: wrong Keaton franchise), they can line up at a fake box office in <em>Roblox </em>and buy real-world movie tickets via Fandango. And now the real reason for this odd marketing stunt is clear: to get people to buy tickets to a movie. </p><h2 id="h100130"><a id=""></a>Let’s read some buzzwords! </h2><p>“We are always looking to engage audiences and amplify our reach in new and exciting ways; this first-of-its-kind collaboration with <em>Roblox</em> and Fandango for <em>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice</em> allows for just that,” Cameron Curtis, VP of marketing at Warner Bros. totally said out loud. For real. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/warner-bros-launches-beetlejuice-roblox-experience-with-virtual-box-office/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/warner-bros-launches-beetlejuice-roblox-experience-with-virtual-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And not just in this buzzword-laden comment shared in a press release</a></span>. </p><p>“As we continue to test commerce, offering an opportunity to purchase tickets within the movie-inspired immersive environment is a way to explore a new consumer category and further engage users who are looking to purchase different things,” said Stephanie Latham, <em>Roblox’s </em>VP of global partnerships in a comment that feels like it was spit out by a robot pretending to be human, but failing.</p><p>Anyway, that new <em>Beetlejuice </em>movie arrives in theaters on September 6. You can visit this new <em>Roblox</em> experience now. </p><p>Or, instead, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">you can just read <em>Roblox </em>Studio head Stefano Corazza’s comments</a></span> suggesting their game helps “kids” living in the “slums” make money via content creation.
