		<p>Have you been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and want to have both more company than the solo mode and less of a crowd than the three-player co-op? Well, you’ll be glad to hear that a patch is coming next week to add a two player mode on 30th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Two Player Mode Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWqBTAYa8h4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Duo Expeditions will be added to Elden Ring Nightreign in patch 1.02, and update that will also bring quality-of-life UI improvements, such as having more Relics filtering options. Full patch notes will doubtless arrive alongside the update.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic</a>, though that didn’t stop millions of eager FromSoftware fans diving in as soon as possible. We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jason saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

<p>On social media, we spotted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m8z5ya/did_anyone_else_know_this/?share_id=aSVBH1olEymD2Q9gTScEH&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">thread from the donkeykong subreddit</a> being shared which revealed to us that, if you die in DK's latest adventure — whether it be to an enemy, in the lava, or by taking too much damage in any of the standard layer levels (not the challenges) — DK's corpse will be left waiting in a mound of gold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>If you return to the statue and break it, you'll get back some of the gold you lost when you died — not all 500 of it, but a little bit. That's very similar to retrieving your souls from the enemy that slayed you or from the ground where you died in Dark Souls.</p>

<p>Look, we know that comparing <em>anything</em> to From Software's seminal action RPG series is walking a fine tightrope — especially when it's something so starkly different, or when it's just describing difficulty.</p>
<p>But in this case, we think the comparison is pretty fair. And honestly, it's just really cool to find your golden DK statue and pose with it.</p>
<p>Surf's up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1948756850171662413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has registered over 9 million players since its launch on April 22. The developer shared the news with a brief message and a picture of the iconic 'adoring fan', a Wood Elf commoner who becomes the player character's "groupie" once they have become the new Grand Champion in the Arena. The adoring fan's hair has been styled into a nine for the occasion.</p>



<p><em>To everyone who emerged as a hero of Kvatch, mastered Arch-Mage, rose to Grand Champion, banished the Blackwood Company, gallivanted as the Gray Fox, and listened to the Night.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for sharing in our worlds. ❤️</em></p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered immediately garnered the attention of Elder Scrolls fans, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking the four million player milestone in just two days of its release</a>. Of course, the fact that it is available on Game Pass across Xbox Series S|X and PC undoubtedly helped a great deal.</p>



<p>Even so, game industry analytics firm Newzoo <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the game delivered 'outstanding revenue performance' and became a benchmark for future remasters. Circana had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified</a> that Oblivion Remastered was the best-selling game of April 2025 in the United States across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, all this success was not enough to prevent Virtuos, the developer behind the remaster, from <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-developer-virtuos-confirms-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cutting nearly 280 employees</a> across its European and Asian offices. It is unclear how these layoffs will impact the game's future support. The game has notoriously inherited the original title's performance issues while roaming the open world, specifically the near-constant hitching. While Update 1.2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-30-fps-rtx-5080-native-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought some improvements</a>, there's still a lot of room for further fixes in this regard. A much improved performance would certainly make exploration even better in a game that is all about that type of gameplay experience, like most titles in the Elder Scrolls franchise. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>The past few years have made the future of video games feel a little bleak. Endless layoffs. The ongoing disruption of creative roles by immediately embracing AI at all costs. Exploding budgets and unpredictable sales. </em></p><p><em>What probably wasn't on your—or our—bingo card, though, was the role credit card companies might play in the process. And yet, the pressure applied to Steam and itch.io has it's put the commercial viability of all kinds of important games, now and in the future, in serious doubt.</em></p><p><em>We talked extensively about this topic on the latest Remap Radio, but that was recorded before all the itch.io stuff went down. Naturally, we haven't been able to shake the topic from our heads in a variety of ways.</em></p><p><em>In this case, it's Rob and Patrick looking at the topic from a much broader lens, about the role media plays in the development of identity, of the conversations parents are afraid to have with their children, and what a "dangerous" internet even is in a world of artificial boogeymen.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Ages ago I was in this creative writing class. Intro-level so the talent levels were all over the map and some of the stories people contributed were clearly more exercises in journaling or therapy than writing. It led to some awkward moments, but the one that I think about a lot is this story a particularly untalented student contributed.</p><p>It was a gothic, hallucinatory story of child abuse described ineptly in lurid detail. It was deeply unpleasant to read and also incredibly stupid (the angel Michael showed up at the end and read a PSA about child abuse). But the point of a creative writing class to is to give and receive feedback so we all went around the room discussing this story. Nobody was being a dick, everyone was kind of uncomfortable, but was trying gently to talk about why it wasn’t good and things that could have made it better. Finally the professor, who was a delightful and sensitive man, said, “This story is just incredibly heightened but does not embrace any of the fantastical elements it feels like it’s reaching for. It’s unrealistic and confusing in what it portrays. It could be toned down or turned up, but it’s just not really convincing or compelling as it is.”</p><p>Our poor author had been getting quieter and angrier throughout the session but now she snapped. “Unrealistic? No convincing? It’s funny you say that, because I lived through stuff like this.”</p><p>Patrick, you could have heard a pin drop. Nobody really knew what to say. If she was being accurate then we’d wrung something out of her that it didn’t feel like we had any business knowing… but I can’t overstate how bad and weird the story was. The story wasn’t sexual but the attempts at portraying the violence were undeniably clumsily erotic, so now everyone mostly just wanted to move on and pretend the last twenty minutes had not happened.</p><p>I remembered it, though, both because it was an incredibly embarrassing conversation for all concerned, but it was also really instructive about the degree to which <em>fantasies are not wishes</em>. To this day I have no idea what exactly that girl had gone through, but telling<em> that </em>story in <em>that </em>way did something for her. I try and bear this in mind when it comes to all manner of adult or erotic content that’s out there. Sometimes the act of creating and consuming that material serves some kind of therapeutic purpose, sometimes it’s just a way of touching some kind of forbidden darkness, and sometimes it’s just the titillation of the forbidden. But as with all creative work, the notion that depiction or exploration equates to endorsement or enthusiasm is incredibly wrong-headed. Fundamentally, the inner experiences of feelings of the people on either side of that transaction, creation or consumption, are unknowable to me but I don’t like making assumptions and tend to adopt a “not my business if no one is being harmed” approach to all kinds of stuff I find unpleasant or just alien.</p><p>I think most people tend to draw a similar line. Few people <em>want </em>to think of themselves as busybodies. But we run into problems when we try and define “harm”. Right now games platforms are being besieged by payment processors who are cracking down on content they have decided they find objectionable, either out of their own inclination or because they are being pressured by activist groups. Notionally, the interest being served here is keeping inappropriate material out of the hands of children who can be harmed by being exposed to it, or out of the hands of people who can be made <em>more likely </em>to harm others if they consume and enjoy such material.</p><p>I don’t think those concerns are entirely without merit. Consumption of a lot of porn seems like it could and does stoke some fairly warped views around sexuality and relationships. But is porn doing that <em>to </em>someone or is the kind of person who compulsively watches hours and hours of porn servicing views that have already become warped and unhealthy in some way? Is this a problem that is solved by censorship and, more importantly, is the <em>fucking credit card company </em>the organization that should be making those rulings?</p><p>I think that’s pretty patently not the case but I also have to admit that it’s very easy for me to retreat to a kind of lazy libertarian perspective on this stuff because I don’t have kids and mostly think the interests and rights of parents are a smokescreen used to lend a high-mindedness to attempts at patriarchal control. I do wonder, though, would I be more concerned about the propagation of creepy, misogynistic or perverted content if I had kids who were in danger of stumbling across it or coming of age among peers who have completely unfettered access to all kinds of disturbing stuff?</p><p>These moral crusades are often launched on behalf of children and parents, and it’s very easy for me to roll my eyes and dismiss all their points but I am curious where you are with some of this stuff? Do you have dreads around this type of content as well?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@ltoinel?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Ludovic Toinel</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Light topic this week, huh? We’re going to London and Paris next week, and in telling a neighbor about this, they handed me a bunch of spare tourist material from an old trip they went on. You know, maps, an English-to-French hand dictionary, etc. It’s the kind of stuff you handle on a phone these days, but it was kind of them, so I took it home, figuring my oldest would get a kick out of it. She started to page through the dictionary, and the first thing she shouted out loud to the room was “Can I make love to you?”</p><p>I gave her a quizzical look, unsure what to do. She gave me an <em>equally</em> quizzical look, likely informed by my unexpected pause. Without skipping a beat, she shrugged her shoulders and flipped to the next page.</p><p>The topic of “Can I make love to you?” has, thankfully, not come up since.</p><p>This is a longer way of saying: I don’t know. It’s not a problem I have to deal with and I’m happy to not have an answer about it because it doesn’t have easy answers and I’ll deal with it when I have no choice.</p><p>The answer I tell myself is that I will raise young people with the tools to guide them through. I cannot be there to help them cross the street every time. At some point, you have to trust they’ll look both ways. The same responsibility for looking left and right falls to parents teaching their children to navigate the internet. I do not intend to install network sniffers to monitor the browsing activity of my kids, once they are of the age where you should begin handing responsibility of their life and decisions over to them, not you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You ever wake up and think it'll be a normal day only to discover that literally everything you thought you knew about reality is wrong? That's what happened to <em>me</em> today when I woke up, sat down to work, and then read a post stating that Mario and Peach are apparently "good friends" as opposed to, I dunno, anything else I might have thought they were to one another.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can."</p><p>Via: Nintendo Today app. <a href="https://t.co/IsyQqe2KLz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IsyQqe2KLz</a></p></div>— Kābī (@KirPinkFury) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This aggravating discovery comes from the Nintendo Today app. The post that originally included this information is now gone due to the app's regularly updating, but has since been preserved in several spots including by <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user @KirPinkFury</a>, who originally surfaced it online. The post, which was a profile on Princess Peach, included the sentence, "Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can." Good friends, you say? What about all those times they definitely smooched?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look," you might say, "they could be good friends and in a relationship. It's important to be friends with the person you love also." Sure, you're correct. But who's describing a relationship like that? I don't go around referring to my husband as my "good friend". That would probably confuse several people, including him! The only conclusion I can come to here is that Nintendo is trying to distance Mario and Peach from the previous very, very, very direct ways in which it indicated they were, at minimum, romantically interested.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo admittedly has been deeply inconsistent about this over the years. Peach has been referred to as Mario's "special someone," they've been shown on multiple occasions to have some level of romantic interest in one another. Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190822105931/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/06/17/marios-developers-on-hat-capture-and-peachs-love-for-mario.aspx?amp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has directly said in an interview</a> before that Mario "carries a torch" for Peach. Nintendo celebrated them as a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/434371505024409600" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">romantic couple, pink hearts and all</a>, for Valentine's Day at least once. And Mario even tried to propose to her at the end of Super Mario Odyssey. Though she refused at the time, she had also just gone through a wild ordeal with Bowser where he tried to kidnap her and force her into marrying <em>him. </em>If I had just been kidnapped into an attempted forced marriage and then rescued and my boyfriend tried to propose to me the second I was rescued, I'd probably tell him to take a hike too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But whatever! I guess they're just friends or something. Just like Link and Zelda, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdom-hints-that-link-and-zelda-are-finally-in-a-relationship">two characters who live together and definitely sleep in the same bed</a>. Next they're going to try and tell me there's nothing going on between all those people in Fire Emblem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone who's wanted to run through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> with just their trusted duos partner is getting their wish. FromSoftware <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWqBTAYa8h4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed today</a> that a two-player Duo Expeditions mode will arrive in Elden Ring Nightreign Patch 1.02.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch will arrive on July 30, allowing just two Nightfarers to embark on expeditions to strike down the Nightlords together. Before now, the only options were to either head out on a solo expedition or team up with two others for a trio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Duos has been a hotly requested feature, as it there seems to be a solid contingent of players who'd like to play with just one other person. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players">Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki previously said</a> the two-player mode was something that was "overlooked" during development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of Elden Ring Nightreign's launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million">FromSoftware committed to adding Duo Expeditions</a> as a mode. And now, several weeks later, the option is finally ready. I imagine this should be a nice option for playing with your pals and loved ones, without the need to add a random third to the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.02 also brings a few other updates in the quality-of-life department, including more filtering options for your Relic pool. Considering players probably have a hefty amount of Relics at this point (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-player-discovers-theres-a-maximum-number-of-relics-you-can-store">hopefully not too many</a>), the added sorting options should be nice too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eager duos and everyone else queuing up will have some tough fights ahead of them too, as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-start-rolling-out-more-enhanced-bosses-at-the-end-of-july">next Everdark cycle spins up at the end of July</a>. Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and the Fissure in the Fog are all set to receive their enhanced Everdark Sovereign fights starting July 31. Solos, duos, and trios alike should have a good time learning these bouts, if the past few Everdark Sovereigns are any indication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's good to see this particular playstyle finally get accomodated, and considering it's been a little under two months since Nightreign launched, it didn't take that long either. It's certainly been intriguing to watch FromSoftware work on a live service-oriented game like Elden Ring Nightreign, and considering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">the potential for DLC down the road</a>, I'm betting there's still more to see in the Lands Between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-its-two-player-duos-mode-on-july-30]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Crytek was founded in 1999 by three Turkish-German brothers, Cevat, Avni, and Faruk Yerli. The brothers have come together to bring a limited-series documentary about everything Crytek, with the first part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnHi6SltHk&amp;t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already online</a>. For the first time, fans will be able to see previously unseen footage, explore early concept art, and delve deeper into the stories that made the studio what it was.</p><p>The documentary starts with the story of the brothers getting a black box PC from their father, which they said was for "studying," but they knew what they wanted to do with their lives. They also knew what they didn't want.</p><p>"We cannot be a typical German game company, because German game companies, usually used to, back then, make strategy games, RPG games very complicated to play," said Avni. "So our idea was to offer an experience, which is open-world sandbox experiences, semi-sandbox experiences, where you can also see the environment, walk around, experience everything. And that was completely new."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnHi6SltHk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HxnHi6SltHk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Initially based in Coburg, Germany, the studio aimed to push the boundaries of real-time 3D graphics in video games. Their early tech demos, such as X-Isle, caught the attention of Nvidia and led to a publishing deal with Ubisoft for their first major game, Far Cry, released in 2004.</p><p>The first part mostly covers the development of Crysis and how they wanted to take what they learned from Far Cry and expand on that, pushing the limits on graphics at the time.</p><p>"In Far Cry, the art department created a natural environment as they have imagined it. Like they built the jungle out of their head, so to say. And in Crysis, we mimicked nature as closely as possible. I think that made a massive difference. Even though in some areas, the technology wasn't so different," said Crysis 3D artist, Marcel Schaika.</p><p>"The way we built the environment, the way we used the technology, like really specifically trying to mimic, how nature behaves, how leaves look like when the sun shines through them how the ocean looks like, how the water refracts, and so on," Schaika continued. "The artists working together with the engineers to really try to create a virtual environment that looks just like the references that we have gathered. I think that mindset made Crysis stand out so much in comparison as well."</p><p>Part one is only 20 minutes long, and it's unclear how many parts of the documentary will be released.</p><p>In other Crytek news, the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crytek-announces-significant-layoffs-as-crysis-4-is-put-on-hold/1100-6529419/" data-ref-id="1100-6529419">underwent layoffs</a> earlier this year, resulting in a new Crysis sequel being put on hold.</p>

		<p>Hello User and welcome to your new Internet experience. Before you embark on this amazing journey please scan your face, a government issued ID, your birth certificate and provide payment details. Do not worry, all of this personal information will be completely safe. There has never been a breach of personal data in the history of the Internet, and your identity will not be compromised.</p>
<p>What can we show you today, User? I see that you have selected content labelled as “not safe for work”. Do you have all of the required ID and face scans to validate your age? Yes, we know you provided it earlier, but think of the Internet like a vast shopping centre where every cashier will need to check your information. Don’t worry, it is all legitimate and safe, a process managed by global partners. It should be no problem for you to let everyone know what kind of things you are into.</p>
<div id="attachment_462166"><p id="caption-attachment-462166">We might be due another UK-themed Not Tonight –&nbsp;Image credit: PanicBarn,<br>No More Robots</p></div>
<p>Excellent, your ID all checks out, User. However, I am sorry to say that you cannot access the content you requested. Yes, you have the funds to purchase this legitimate content, but your payment processor has deemed the topics contained within this media unacceptable and has requested it be removed from sale. User, you do not need to know why a corporation that is not even based in your geographic area can make this decision for you. It is for your own good. There is plenty of other content you can view instead across the excellent world wide web.</p>
<p>When we say world wide web, we mean to say websites and services that are permitted by your Internet Service Provider and government legislation. Gone are the days where you would have to endlessly click on different websites with their own content and ideas. Today, we have made your Internet experience much more convenient, directing you to the same few websites to meet all of your content and shopping needs. You won’t need to worry about visiting those smaller sites ever again, when we can provide you with the latest information on a more curated selection of platforms. You can see everyone’s creativity and permitted ideas in one place!</p>

<div id="attachment_462164"><p id="caption-attachment-462164">Is Zane even old enough to use the new Internet? –&nbsp;Image credit: Tendershoot, No More Robots</p></div>
<p>We appreciate everyone on the Internet, but some content is just better for you. Do not worry too much about things being produced by smaller creators, or historically marginalised groups, we will give you so much approved content that you will come to appreciate ignoring them. Most importantly, your children will also be kept completely safe from interacting with undesirable content and ideas.</p>
<p>So again, User, welcome to the Internet. A place of freedom*, creativity*, learning*, and connection*.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KRAFTON, the publisher that has more recently been in the news due to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">messy back-and-forth</a> with the co-founders of Unknown Worlds, who allege that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">KRAFTON delayed Subnautica 2 to avoid paying a $250 million bonus</a> to the Unknown Worlds team, is back in the news for a different reason today, a studio acquisition. Eleventh Hour Games, the team behind Last Epoch, has just been acquired by KRAFTON.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-qa-on-runemaster-class-1-0-launch-and-advantages-over-diablo-iv/">Eleventh Hour Games</a> (EHG) was founded back in 2017, with chief executive officer Judd Cobler going to Reddit to find people with game development experience to make what would become Last Epoch. A 2018 Kickstarter raised enough funds to get the studio going, and on April 30, 2019, it launched into Early Access on Steam. It didn't hit its <a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-shows-off-unique-trade-system-ahead-of-1-0-launch/">1.0 launch</a> until just last year, February 21, 2024, and according to a <a href="https://press.krafton.com/KRAFTON-Acquires-Eleventh-Hour-Games-Creators-of-Last-Epoch">press release</a> for its acquisition by KRAFTON, Last Epoch has sold 3 million copies since last February.</p>



<p>"<em>Through this acquisition, KRAFTON aims to secure a competitive franchise IP in the Action RPG genre and further strengthen its position in the global market," </em>writes KRAFTON. "<em>The deal provides EHG with the resources and infrastructure to better serve its community, ensuring that Last Epoch</em> <em>continues to evolve and meet the expectations of its growing player base. The acquisition will also enable EHG to scale development across console platforms and expand seasonal content pipelines, setting the stage for long-term franchise development. KRAFTON will support EHG’s live service roadmap, team expansion, and international publishing, while allowing the studio to retain full leadership and creative autonomy</em>."</p>



<p>KRAFTON's head of corporate development, Maria Park, added that the publisher is "<em>thrilled to welcome Eleventh Hour Games into the KRAFTON family,"</em> and that EHG's "<em>rise from a grassroots studio to a globally renowned ARPG developer is nothing short of remarkable."</em> Park also claims that this acquisition "<em>reaffirms our unwavering passion for great games and the teams that build them. We will always stand behind developers who put players first,"</em> which is difficult to see as anything but a snide shot towards the Subnautica 2 co-founders. </p>



<p>On the other side of the aisle, for Eleventh Hour Games, Cobler adds that this acquisition is "<em>a dream come true</em>" for the studio, and that KRAFTON's "<em>deep-rooted passion for ARPGs aligns perfectly with our mission."</em> </p>



<p>"<em>With KRAFTON's support, EHG is poised to elevate the </em><em>Last Epoch</em> franchise to even greater heights. As a studio built from players of the genre, we couldn’t be more excited for its future."</p>



<p>Due to the ongoing legal battle between KRAFTON and Unknown Worlds, it's difficult to take any of these statements at face value when we see how that relationship has eroded in the last four years. Unknown Worlds co-founder Charlie Cleveland also said that Unknown Worlds and KRAFTON were "<em>aligned</em>" in their goals when <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">KRAFTON's acquisition of Unknown Worlds was announced</a>. But, according to Cleveland and the rest of the co-founders, KRAFTON's attitude towards the studio turned on a dime within the last year. </p>



<p>Hopefully, today's statements remain true for Eleventh Hour Games and KRAFTON in the future.</p>

Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.”</p><p>Techland promises to keep fans in the loop with regular updates, and Dying Light: The Beast will still be playable at Gamescom next month.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0GCr2P9510"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0GCr2P9510" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Dying Light: The Beast began as an expansion for Dying Light 2 Stay Human that was fleshed out into a standalone title.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hot off the release of The Alters, 11 Bit Studios has announced the long-awaited console release date for its difficult city-builder survival simulation title, Frostpunk 2. The game took home the award for Best Sim/Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024, and now it will be made available for a wider audience this September.</p><p>Frostpunk 2 puts you in the shoes of "The Steward," the leader of New London in a wintry apocalypse set 30 years after the first title, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/frostpunk/b/pc/archive/2018/04/23/frostpunk-review-a-frigid-unrelenting-survival-success.aspx">earned an 8.75 out of 10</a> from <em>Game Informer </em>when it was released in 2018. Throughout the campaign, players must manage a much larger city and its resources and people, making near-impossible decisions along the way to ensure the populace's survival.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>11 Bit claims to have implemented many lessons from its console port of the first Frostpunk, which arrived in 2019, a year and a half after the PC version launched. The circular interface has been fine-tuned to allow for the intricate keyboard controls to translate even better on gamepad. Players will be able to use controller bumpers to cycle between districts and access a dynamic radial menu for actions involving resource piles. For those on PC who would like to use gamepad controls, the PC version will receive a free update adding this control scheme as an option.</p><p>"Initially, we tried to carry over as many interface solutions as possible," production coordinator Igor Skibinski said in a press release. "But the two games differ so much in terms of gameplay that we had to adapt and rework those systems over time. Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless – so players never have to think about how to play while they're playing. Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex strategy games can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles."</p><p>Additionally, 11 Bit Studios partnered with Skybound Games to create two premium physical editions to accompany the digital release. The Icebreaker Edition includes the full game on disc, a pop-up diorama of New London, a digital novella called <em>Warm Flesh</em>, and a digital artbook that chronicles the creation of Frostpunk 2's world. The Whiteout Edition includes all of the Icebreaker Edition content, plus a multi-layered shadow box with integrated LED lighting, a Deluxe Edition upgrade that grants access to three upcoming DLC releases, a metal-and-enamel keychain, two New London art postcards, Frostpunk-themed stickers, and one of two possible embroidered faction patches. The Icebreaker Edition will be $50, while the Whiteout Edition retails for $100.</p><p>Frostpunk 2 arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) on September 18. Although&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>was shut down during the time when we would have otherwise reviewed it, we came away from a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2024/05/27/breaking-the-ice">2024 hands-on session with very positive impressions</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/25/frostpunk-2-arrives-on-consoles-in-september]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new Plants vs Zombies game is reportedly seeing some movement behind the scene, with a potential release date coming up this year. Plants vs Zombies Reloaded (or Replanted, if the report is to be believed), is said to be a remake of the original game, which may be sprouting up this October.
</p>
<p>This information comes <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-version-revisitee-de-plants-vs-zombies-en-approche-on-vous-revele-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-60272">courtesy of Dealabs</a>, a website known for its history of leaks that have largely proven correct. 
</p>
<p>According to the publication, Plants vs Zombies Replanted will launch on 23rd October. Dealabs claims the game will be revealed within the month, and sell for €19.99 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Plants vs Zombies 'Reloaded' was previously registered as a trademark in Brazil, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1902169093538521453?">as spotted by Gematsu in March</a>, but according to Dealabs the developers at PopCap want to dub it something a bit more in-line with what the series is about. Thus: Replanted. 
</p>
<p>Plants vs Zombies has proven exceptionally popular over the years. The original game was an instant classic, winning over huge numbers of people with its quirky take on the tower defence genre. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-review">In the original 2009 Eurogamer review</a> (good times), Christian Donlan stated the game was: "An effortlessly streamlined take on tower defence games, enemies march across the screen from right to left, sticking to polite rows, and it's up to the player to place the various weapons required to slow their progress and finish them off."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-reloaded-release-date-rumoured-for-october-launch]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hmmm, we've heard this one before</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario RPG Kissing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4fe6194595fe8/super-mario-rpg-kissing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's official, folks — Mario and Peach are <em>not</em> in a relationship. Nintendo said it, so it <em>must</em> be true.</p>
<p>A few days ago, on the Nintendo Today! App, the Big N dropped this major bombshell on the world, revealing that the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the Italian plumber are simply "good friends". We missed the initial post, but thankfully, <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122">KirPinkFury</a> has us covered.</p>
<p>So, wait, is this despite the fact Peach has kissed Mario multiple times and baked multiple cakes for him? We know both of these acts <em>are</em> platonic (cheek kissing, baking), but... okay.</p>

<p>This all sounds a little familiar, right? Another darling Nintendo couple, Zelda and Link, are frequently under the microscope from fans. Are they in a relationship? Aren't they?</p>
<p>Zelda's voice actor, Patricia Summerset, once said "I know that [Link and Zelda] are in a relationship with each other" in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/patricia-summersett-interview-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">TheGamer</a> as part of a wider conversation about enjoying the ambiguity of their relationship, before putting out a <a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660696953712197635">statement a few days later saying</a> that her words do "not imply" that the duo are in love.</p>
<p>Really, though, all of this is up to fan interpretation. If Mario and Peach want some privacy, that's great. Nintendo can insist the pair aren't a couple — and maybe that's the case. To be fair, Peach <em>did</em> turn down Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Next thing Nintendo will be telling us is that Donkey Kong doesn't love bananas.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the comments whether you believe Nintendo is telling the truth.</em><em><br></em></p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will add its highly-requested two-player mode next week on July 30, 2025, with Patch 1.02, and while the introduction of duo expeditions remains the highlight for the update, FromSoftware is also adding a few key quality-of-life and UI improvements in the patch, like better filtering options for relics.</p>



<p>FromSoftware's co-operative multiplayer roguelike action game has gone better than anyone might've expected when the game was first announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">The Game Awards 2024</a>. In its launch month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-topped-us-sales-charts-may-2025/">topping sales charts in the US</a> and breaking into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">top five on more global charts</a>.  It stayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">top-10 for US game sales for June</a>, and remained <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">one of the top-15 best-selling games globally</a>. </p>



<p>The introduction of a duos mode, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">something players have requested</a> since FromSoftware tested the game's servers in an open beta (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-mods-framerate-two-player-mode-easier-solo/">already implemented themselves through mods</a>) is sure to give the community a boost, and might even convince some players who have been on the fence to finally pick it up, knowing that they can hop in with the one other friend they have, and no longer be handicapped by being unable to find a third friend to play with. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be interesting to see where Nightreign stands when we get a look at sales and engagement charts for July halfway through next month. Even though this update is coming right at the end of the month, it has approximately two days to make a significant impact.</p>



<p>FromSoftware also recently celebrated Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">surpassing 5 million units sold since it launched in May</a>, a huge milestone for the company's first major foray into multiplayer and the first time it has adapted one of its major narrative and action-driven Souls games into an online multiplayer experience. </p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how FromSoftware's second foray into turning elements players recognize from its single-player games into a multiplayer experience goes when <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> arrives as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced when you can expect the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>duos update to land, and it's not too far away at all, so get ready to revisit Limveld with your buddy.</p>

<p><i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>'s duos mode was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">revealed in early June</a>, but now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the date on which you'll be able to tackle Limveld's dangers with just one other person: July 30th.</p>

<p>The ability to play in a duo will be added as part of patch 1.02, which will also bring new ways to sort relics, hopefully making organizing your favorite loadouts a little easier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=LdljaS4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=NrplKzA7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s duos mode is coming very soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was released back in late May, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassing over two million sales</a> on its first day of release. At launch, the game only supported solo play or squads of three, and players quickly began requesting a duo mode, which FromSoftware was evidently happy to implement.</p>

<p>After release,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update" rel="nofollow">new superpowered versions</a> of the Nightlord bosses to take on, plus new quality-of-life improvements and more.</p>

<p>News of the duos update's release date comes shortly after&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">reached five million sales</a>&nbsp;earlier this week, with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC currently sitting at ten million. Those are some pretty encouraging numbers for Bandai Namco, I'm sure.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>that sees players descending on a randomly-generated map in order to kill minibosses, loot gear, and get strong enough to take on a boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>The game is one of two major multiplayer-oriented titles in FromSoftware's slate for the next couple of years; the other is&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game</a> set to launch sometime next year.</p>

If you’re looking to make an upgrade soon, there’s a temporary $350 discount at Best Buy on a configuration that I think is a great choice for gamers who prefer to play titles at their highest graphics settings.</p><p>Normally $2,399.99, the discounted price of $2,049.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white%2F6613954.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> gets you the model that features a 2,880 x 1,800 OLED screen at 120Hz with G-Sync, AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti graphics chip, 32GB of 7,500MHz DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of storage. It’s not particularly tough to find a gaming laptop with these specs. However, I think it’s a feat to cram them all into a laptop that’s small and light enough to easily bring on trips, and to deliver it at a price that’s not too high considering what you’re getting.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/713731/asus-rog-g14-zephyrus-gaming-laptop-5070ti-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

But that option is coming soon. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 25</a></span>, FromSoftware announced that <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>’s 1.02 patch will add a duos option, letting “two kindred souls” play together. The patch is set to arrive on July 30. </p><p>Currently in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign,</em> there are two ways to play.  You can either play solo, which is tough and not something our resident <em>Nightreign </em>sicko Ethan Gach recommends, or you can play with two other people.  So if you and a friend want to hop into <em>Elden Ring Nightreign,</em> you either have to deal with a random third player or convince someone you know to play with you. </p><p>It’s a bit wild that it didn’t launch with a duos option, as it seems like something obvious that players would want. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">In fact, within 48 hours of launch</a></span>, a modder added such an option to<em> Nightreign </em>on PC. So why didn’t FromSoftware include duos right away? Turns out, they just sort of didn’t think about it. </p><p> “The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we’re very sorry about that,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> director Junya Ishizaki told <em>IGN</em></a></span>. “As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus, and it’s at the core of <em>Nightreign</em>.”</p><p>However, starting next week, you and your best buddy will be able to play online together, without a rando, and get killed by tough bosses as a power couple instead of a clunky trio. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A two-player mode is making its debut in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> next week, allowing duos to run together without seeking a third player.</p><p>From Software has announced that a duos mode will be added to Elden Ring Nightreign on July 30 alongside update 1.02, which is aimed at providing a variety of other quality-of-life improvements. Full patch notes haven't been revealed yet.</p><p>The highly requested feature will be a game-changer for some folks looking to tackle the challenges in Limveld. When Elden Ring Nightreign first launched, players were forced to enter matches solo or in a group of three, the latter of which forced duo partners to team up with a random third player or seek out an additional person to join up.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/" data-ref-id="1100-6531963">A mod</a> released just weeks after Elden Ring: Nightreign launched allowed PC players to run duos, but players on other platforms remained out of luck. So, it's great news that everyone will finally be able to run matches with a team size of their choosing.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign director, Junya Ishizaki, initially told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> the game's focus on three-player matches "was largely a game-balancing decision, rather than a game-design decision." Later, he admitted in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">separate interview</a> that a two-player mode was "simply something that was overlooked during development" before stating the team was looking into it.</p><p>This new addition couldn't come at a better time, either, as Elden Ring Nightreign recently crossed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">5 million units shipped</a>. This comes along with news that the original Elden Ring has sold over 30 million copies alone, making the franchise From Software's most commercially successful ever.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MindsEye GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The post begins as follows:</p><p>"Dear community, it’s been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we’re grateful for your support and detailed feedback. Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game.</p><p>In June, we committed to delivering a great experience for all players. Since then, we’ve released three updates, each addressing bug fixes and performance improvements across all devices, driven by your reports and suggestions. We hope you’re starting to see the impact of these changes, and we’re committed to building on this progress. Moving forward, updates may be less frequent, but with the aim for each to bring more meaningful changes."</p><p>The rest of the post vaguely outlines the next few months of fixes. First though, Build A Rocket Boy issued a delay to its Hitman crossover, which was originally intended to land in July. The team didn't provide a firm date, or even commit to a window--just saying that it has been pushed back and that it looks forward to "delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right."</p><p>Looking forward, August will bring MindsEye's fourth significant performance update to both PC and consoles. This patch will also bring features requested by the community, including skippable cutscenes and instant access to user-generated content on PC.</p><p>In September, MindsEye is set to receive another major update across all systems, once again bolstering performance and providing vaguely worded "gameplay improvements, alongside a number of enhancements to core gameplay mechanics."</p><p>Beyond that, MindsEye and Build A Rocket Boy's future remains uncertain. The studio was almost immediately rocked by news of layoffs following the game's turbulent June launch, when it was plagued by technical bugs and visual glitches that inspired a lot of frustration and mockery online. GameSpot's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> called it a "stringent and relentlessly dull video game," awarding the game a 3/10 while somehow avoiding most of its technical blemishes.</p>

			<p>New details on CD Projekt Red's mysterious Project Hadar emerged online today thanks to a new job ad discovered online.</p>



<p>As spotted by<a href="https://tech4gamers.com/cdpr-project-hadar-action-rpg-melee-combat/"> Tech4Gamers</a>, CD Projekt Red is looking to hire a Senior Gameplay Designer specifically for the development of Project Hadar, a new IP from the studio, with at least 5 years of experience in the RPG/action titles with melee-oriented combat, suggesting the game will have a major focus on close range combat. The rest of the required qualifications don't reveal anything new about this game, such as experience in working with Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5, as the studio announced a while back that Epic's engine would power its future projects.</p>



<p>Project Hadar is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-3-witcher-projects-new-ip-in-development-cd-projekt-red/">many projects</a> in development at CD Projekt Red, which include a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, currently known as Project Orion, and the next entry in The Witcher series, The Witcher 4. Revealed last year during The Game Awards show, the next entry in the series, which will star Ciri in place of Geralt of Rivia, is being made with a console-first approach and will take<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"> full advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but if the tech demo shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">last month</a> is of any indication, it definitely looks like CD Projekt Red will have no trouble surpassing anything it has released so far.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Earlier this week, VShojo, the VTuber talent agency that claims to put "talent first," came under fire as its biggest talent, Ironmouse, alleged that the company had failed to pay her a "significant sum" of money, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/" data-ref-id="1100-6533329">failing to donate</a> more than $515,000 that she had raised for the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Now, after a mass exodus of its talent that saw VShojo without a single remaining VTuber on its books, the CEO has admitted to spending those funds to try to keep the company afloat.</p><p>In a statement posted to the <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VShojo X account </a>on July 24, CEO Justin Ignacio has admitted that he has "mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing." Ignacio goes on to confirm that VShojo has been facing financial difficulties in recent months, and that despite raising "around $11 million" to pursue a "talent-first" approach, the company eventually ran out of money. Ignacio says that "some of the money was raised in connection with talent activity," and claims that he later learned that it was intended for a charitable initiative. He continues, "We were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all our expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts."</p><p>However, <a href="https://t.co/TJZBz8jga5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">users on X</a> have pointed out <a href="https://t.co/sxmoBNqh8G" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several instances</a> where Ignacio acknowledged Ironmouse's charity streams at the time, and allege that he did not "later learn" this fact at all, but was aware for the duration of VShojo's struggles. As a response to the situation, <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1948526128391721036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch has removed the "GunRun" global emote</a> that was dedicated to Ignacio.</p><p>As Ignacio confirmed that "VShojo is shutting down," some former talents are taking this as a sign that the nondisclosure agreements that they signed are no longer valid. Several VTubers have spoken out and alleged that the company had "<a href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">predatory contracts</a>," and claiming that they are owed merch and sponsorship funds from "<a href="https://t.co/NyQZbKvso1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">years ago</a>."</p><p>In line with discovering that the funds she raised had not been donated to the Immune Deficiency Foundation, Ironmouse launched her own <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify campaign</a> to raise money for the charity. At the time of writing, it has surpassed $1.25 million raised in just three days.</p>
