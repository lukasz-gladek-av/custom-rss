			<p>Survival Horror is going through a big resurgence at the moment (even if it never really went away) with genre titans <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Resident Evil</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/check-out-two-new-trailers-for-silent-hill-2/">Silent Hill</a> being joined by originators like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a> and indie breakouts such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>. Amongst this assortment of monstrous experiences, Conscript stands out with its setting and visuals. Largely the work of a solo developer, Jordan Mochi, the end result is a traumatic and challenging game that takes the tried and tested tropes of the genre and mixes them with a truly horrific tone and feel.</p>
<p><iframe title="CONSCRIPT | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg0_nVHmbWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While not unique in its wartime setting – relatively recently both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/07/psychological-horror-ad-infinitum-new-trailer/">Ad Infinitum</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/17/amnesia-the-bunker-review/">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> featured a similar backdrop – Conscript really comes into its own by focusing on the real horrors and traumas of The Great War (a name that becomes more ironic as time marches on). Supernatural elements are largely kept to the background here and instead the most horrific aspects are the violence and inhuman acts carried out by soldiers following orders. Your fragility and fears go a long way to replace the usual zombies and monsters that characterise the genre.</p>


<p>Set during the Battle of Verdun, you play as a French soldier who is trying to find his missing brother and make it through the conflict alive. In between chapters you play through short quiet flashbacks that help to familiarise you with your character and their background whilst also serving to offer a dynamic contrast with the dark and claustrophobic nature of the rest of the game. While this highly personal story runs the risk of romanticising or sentimentalising a savage and lethal part of history, the opposite is the case. This story places you within the conflict and gives you the opportunity to empathise with those put in an impossible position.</p>


<p>Conscript’s art direction is very distinctive. Using a top-down camera and employing a PS1 era level of fidelity gives the game a grimy look that is perfectly suited to the trenches and bunkers you’ll be traversing. The use of line of sight and the environmental darkness ensure that you never feel at ease too. Environments themselves are somewhat lacking in variety but that is a necessary part of the setting. That being said, the game does offer a range of locations from the trenches and forts to an occupied French town. The audio accompanying this is suitably oppressive and low key with the main focus being on atmospheric sound effects.</p>
<p>Very much in keeping with the Survival Horror genre, you’ll spend your time scavenging for resources, making choices about how best to best items to craft new supplies, juggling your weapons within a limited inventory and solving puzzles using logic and key items. This is all very on brand and there is little here that deviates from the established traditions, but that isn’t a criticism. In fact, most of the puzzles are well designed and just difficult enough to be enjoyable with a number requiring you to make notes.</p>

<p>Combat is a pretty large component of the game too, with a decent range of melee and ranged weapons to be scavenged and used as you try to survive. Enemies mostly consist of a handful of German troops with armaments that go from shovels to flamethrowers. A couple of more armoured types are used as mini bosses, but the combat is deliberately monotonous to highlight the pointlessness of the conflict. Your weapons can be upgraded by collecting weapon parts scattered across the maps and a recurring merchant is available who feels like an early ancestor of Resident Evil’s more iconic shopkeep. Here, the main currency is cigarettes, an especially evocative period feature.</p>
<p>There are various difficulty levels available, with extra rewards and trophies locked behind specific approaches, such as not killing outside of setpiece encounters or not taking damage. I began on the default difficulty and it mostly felt the right side of challenging, but the pre-release build did suffer from a rodent problem as the swarms of rats that appear after a few hours were far too fast and savage, with their attacks made even worse by a virulent poison effect. You can mitigate this to some extent by using grenades to destroy their nests and by burning bodies to prevent them spawning. This has been addressed in a patch (at least on PC) so should be less of a problem now.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Conscript is a worthy entry into the Survival Horror genre and comes highly recommended. It takes all the ingredients of the genre and marries them to a vital and under-represented part of history in video games to create a standout title that deserves a wider audience.	</p></div>

            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has admitted he's made "the worst" decisions "passing" on some of gaming's biggest franchises over the years, including Bungie's Destiny and Harmonix's Guitar Hero.</p>
<p>In an interview called "Story Time with Phil Spencer" at PAX West over the weekend, Spencer opened up about the games that mattered most to him over the years, including Bungie's 2014 sci-fi shooter, Destiny, in his list.</p>

<p>"There's so many mixed emotions and stories for me around Destiny," Spencer explained.</p>
<p>"Obviously, Bungie was part of Microsoft when I started at Xbox, and I shared a floor with Alex Seropian [and] Jason Jones in the building that we were in Redmond. I learned a ton from just being around Bungie."</p>
<p>Despite his natural closeness to Bungie, Spencer admitted that Destiny "didn't really click" when he first played it, and it took until the game's first expansion, House of Wolves, for it to "land" him.</p>
<p>Consequently, Destiny went on to be published by Activision, as too was Guitar Hero, another series Spencer "passed" on, thinking it wasn't "going to work".</p>
<p>"I've passed on some of the worst… like, made some of the worst game-choice decisions," he said.</p>
<p>"An interesting one is when this team came down to Redmond and Alex Rigopulos, he pitches a game where they're actually going to make plastic guitars, and they're going to plug into consoles, and then they're going to sell tracks where you're going to play Simon on this guitar and I'm like, really? Do we really think that's going to work?</p>
<p>"I hear that turned into a pretty good game..." he added, laughing.</p>
<p>"I'm not a regrets-type person," Spencer explained. "Maybe that's a fault of mine, but I passed on so many games. I could look back and say-," he clenches his fist, "-but no, I try to look forward and be positive about the things that we are doing.</p>
<p>"I just like to celebrate what the team [at Bungie] has done. I mean, it's incredible."</p>
<p>Spencer also recently addressed the surprise revelation that first-party exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">release on PS5 in spring/Q2 2025</a> just a few months after its Xbox debut, stating Xbox is "a business", and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-indiana-jones-ps5-launch-news-by-saying-xbox-is-a-business">"the bar is high in terms of the delivery we have to give back"</a> to parent company Microsoft.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's hard not to talk about Sumerian Six without summoning the spirit of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-developer-announces-final-ever-release">sadly now defunct</a> Mimimi Games. Sumerian Six might <em>technically</em> owe its existence to the real-time, sight-cone-dodging stealth-tactics classics of the 90s and early 2000s – think Commandos and Desperados – but Mimimi's wonderful genre refinements, seen in the brilliant likes of Shadow Tactics and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth-gets-a-rip-roaring-pirate-upgrade">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a>, are in ample evidence as developer Artificer's rip-roaring, globe-trotting, Nazi-bashing pulp adventure unfolds. But for all its mechanical familiarity, Sumerian Six is – as I approach the seven-hour mark, at least - an absolute hoot, an inventive, richly conceived take on the genre that more than holds its own.</p>

<p>It's 1944 and, as our story begins, cocky young adventurer Sid Sterling is attempting to locate his sister Isabella in a Nazi-infested castle somewhere in the snow-covered Alps.  Isabella has been working undercover to keep tabs on scientist (and scoundrel) Hans Kammler, a former member of her father's disbanded Enigma Squad, who's been experimenting with a mysterious, devastatingly powerful substance known Geistoff – one that might, if the Sterlings can't put a stop to it, win the Third Reich's war.</p>
<p>Sumerian Six is properly rip-roaring comic book stuff, full of pulpy action, globe-spanning adventure, and wise-cracking heroes, that – with its witty banter, warm camaraderie, and a wonderfully weird soundtrack – is an immediately winning affair. And it's a gorgeous thing too, its expansive stages – or at least the mountaintop Nazi HQ, verdant German countryside, vertiginous Moroccan-inspired city, and sprawling factory in the heart of the desert I've seen so far – absolutely packed with detail.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a brief taste of Sumerian Six in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmvMX0b90m0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>More than that, though, they're cleverly designed tactical playgrounds, full of diverging pathways, discrete challenge sequences, and optional areas containing XP-boosting crates that encourage exploration and just feel rich with possibilities (I also can't get enough of the heist-movie-like cutscenes outlining possible plans of attack at the start of each mission, utilising scribbled overlays and twirling camera crash zooms). There's a good amount of variety within levels too; one segment might present a more puzzle-y challenge requiring you to think about your toolkit and navigate enemies in specific ways, while others take a more sandbox-y approach, and the organic ebb and flow is enormously satisfying.</p>
<blockquote>Sumerian Six certainly doesn't reinvent the stealth-tactics genre, but it's creative, thoughtfully designed, and enormously fun to play.</blockquote>
<p>That obviously wouldn't be the case if Sumerian Six's moment-by-moment tactical action wasn't up to much, but, so far, it's a pleasure to play. Mechanically, there won't be too many surprises for anyone who's experienced a stealth-tactics game in the last 30 years: it offers a familiar dance of tense sight-cone avoidance and environmental exploitation, borrowing liberally from across the genre's lifetime - including more than a few modern-day refinements from Mimimi Games. You'll scour maps for safe routes and environmental advantages, creep through foliage and crawl behind cover, crouch through jagged sightlines, hide bodies, slip through doors that belch you out elsewhere in a level, lay down markers to study who can see what and when, queue up actions to unleash simultaneously, and so on.</p>
<p>But Sumerian Six carves out its own niche with its wonderfully pulpy spirit and a wildly entertaining toolkit. So far, I've unlocked five playable characters (different missions bring different characters into play, meaning you're constantly forced outside your comfort zone if you're the kind of person to lean heavily on tried-and-tested strategies) and they're all wonderfully diverse, sporting complementary abilities that are a joy to experiment with. Isabella, for instance, can turn invisible for a set number of steps or instantly swap places with enemies (science! if you're wondering how all this is explained in-game), while her brother can go gung-ho with a noisy pistol, or sort-of possess opponents, hitching a ride and hopping from Nazi to Nazi as they pass each other on patrol.</p>
<p>Exiled chemist Rosa Reznick, meanwhile, is an absolute delight, with some truly fiendish tricks up her sleeve. She can root enemies to the spot with an IV drip, melt them into a puddle so their bodies don't need to be hidden (this isn't a quiet process, however), or turn them into walking bombs – useful for taking out groups of their cohorts as they patrol on by. Alistair Sterling commands lightning and can access hilariously entertaining directional spring traps, while Wojtek, when he's not distracting enemies with a well-time bottle toss, can maul them to death by turning into a werebear. It all adds up to an enjoyably flexible toolkit that's rich in tactical potential – bolstered by varied enemy design requiring subtle shifts in strategy, and a gradual progression of new environmental wrinkles, including reinforcement alarms, ability dampeners, and deadly barriers.</p>

<p>Sumerian Six certainly doesn't reinvent the stealth-tactics genre, but – from what I've played at least – it's creative, thoughtfully designed, and enormously fun to play. It is, though, a little lacking in polish, my playthrough marred by issues that make the whole thing feel sloppier than is ideal. I've had abilities suddenly stop working without a reload, crashes when trying to access quick saves from other levels, enemies being alerted to my movements way outside the indicated noise range, sight cones refusing to display for no obvious reason, weirdly inconsistent enemy placement on quick loads, and more. Thankfully, none of this is a regular enough occurrence that it detracts from what Sumerian Six gets right, but there's definitely a sense it could have done with a bit more cooking time.</p>
<p>I am, though, having a blast with Sumerian Six, tinkering around with its inventive toolkit and unleashing sneaky, Nazi-felling mayhem across its cleverly designed world. I was worried Artificer might struggle to impress after Mimimi Games' wonderful Shadow Gambit – not to mention last month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-breach-wizards-review">stellar genre-adjacent Tactical Breach Wizards</a> - but Sumerian Six is a pleasure so far and, issues of polish aside, a wonderful surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tim Burton’s movies are sumptuous eye candy with exaggerated set designs and sharp juxtapositions between gloomy grays and vivid colors. And all of his films center on misfits and oddballs who defy social norms, whether it be real-life artists or ghosts stubbornly haunting a home.<br></p><p>Ahead of the release of the highly anticipated sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/beetlejuice-2-movie-popcorn-bucket-dune-sandworm-1851615359&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/beetlejuice-2-movie-popcorn-bucket-dune-sandworm-1851615359"><em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em></a></span>, we figured we’d rank all of Burtons’ blockbusters. This list ranks all 19 films Tim Burton has directed since 1985, honoring a decades-long career that celebrates the weirdos of this world. Halloween has come early this year, folks.<br></p><p><strong>(Note: Burton did not direct <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, a common misconception as he is the creator of its memorable characters.)</strong> </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ca092fa07c729054d498af342214fc0" data-recommend-id="image://5ca092fa07c729054d498af342214fc0" data-format="png" data-width="2155" data-height="1197" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An alien shoots a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An alien shoots a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

The film depicts clueless Americans being overtaken by extraterrestrials—big-brained creatures with giant heads, bulging eyeballs, and mean mugs. The obviously fake CGI is meant to honor the kitschy aesthetic of the ‘50s, but it’s so goofy-looking it’s hard to take any of it even remotely serious. The film’s cast is stacked with stars such as Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Glenn Close, Annette Benning, Michael J. Fox, Martin Short, and Pam Grier, but all the star power in the world can’t make up for how <em>Mars Attacks</em> is nothing more than a hodgepodge of bizarre gags that are painfully unfunny and too long. All the strangeness—such as Sarah Jessica Parker’s head on a Chihuahua or the hokey skeletons people turn into when they’re zapped by Martians—feels more creepy than comical. The innocent charisma of the original B-movies is lost here and any attempts to satirize it doesn’t translate well to the 1990s.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0ef801c47f6cabdfe6aba89a10aeaea8" data-recommend-id="image://0ef801c47f6cabdfe6aba89a10aeaea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mark Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter (in full ape makeup) stand together.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In between the sloppy sequels of the 1968 original and the epic prequel series with Andy Serkis’ stunning motion-capture performance, there was Tim Burton’s tepid 2001 remake of <em>Planet of the Apes</em>. The main issue with Burton’s version is that it’s either far too campy (like some of the apes complaining about a bad hair day) or struggles to deftly handle the heavier themes of race and class. Mark Wahlberg seems adrift in this blockbuster about a planet where humans are enslaved by far more intelligent apes, and is no match for Charlton Heston, who starred in the first film. The clear standout of <em>The Planet of the Apes</em> is artist Rick Baker’s incredible special FX makeup, which seamlessly transformed well-known actors such as Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, and Paul Giamatti into primates while still retaining some of their recognizable features.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4176a3f8b1a6c74124e930e7fc97a954" data-recommend-id="image://4176a3f8b1a6c74124e930e7fc97a954" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Johnny Depp as a vampire sits at a table.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tim Burton is all over the place trying to adapt <em>Dark Shadows</em>, a popular soap opera from the 1960s about a wealthy vampire Barnabas Collins in a centuries-long feud with the witch Angelique Bouchard. Of course, Collins’ sprawling Maine estate looks incredible, showcasing Tim Burton’s signature Gothic style with ominous spires and stone statues displayed with exquisite attention to detail. The dramatic lighting and wide shots, which take in dust-covered chandeliers and old-fashioned paintings, bring the mansion to life in ways the original television show never could. But for all its spellbinding production design, the story is lacking.<br></p><p>While Tim Burton is usually an expert at striking the right tone, he doesn’t know whether to lean into the campiness or scariness, resulting in a film that toes a boring line down the middle. Rather than indulging us in another chameleonic performance, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking, making this his weakest collaboration with Burton to date (and, thus far, his last). Most of the magnetic power comes from the female cast such as Eva Green and Michelle Pfeiffer. <em>Dark Shadows</em> fails to capture the essence of the original series and doesn’t add anything of its own. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f7c2f238ca17ed4474dc9c4fb22ed9f" data-recommend-id="image://6f7c2f238ca17ed4474dc9c4fb22ed9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo stands with friends.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With an eye for marvels and curiosities, Tim Burton has always had a thing for circuses, and they have appeared in most of his films. So, who better to direct a new <em>Dumbo</em> movie and tell the tale of a baby circus elephant rejected for his enormous ears who discovers he can fly? With his big blue eyes, the CGI version of Dumbo is just cartoony enough to avoid the uncanny valley of the ultra-realism seen in <em>The Lion King</em> “live-action” adaptation. But the issue with Burton’s version, as with many live-action Disney flicks, is that it stretches a short film into a nearly two-hour one. </p><p>While some changes, such as removing Timothy Q. Mouse and the racist crows, were necessary, the post-World War I story of a one-armed veteran and his children who take care of Dumbo isn’t engaging enough—despite all of Colin Farrell’s charms. Try as we may to invest in them, we just want to return to the main attraction: Dumbo. Unfortunately, <em>Dumbo </em>is Tim Burton’s ugliest film with haphazard CGI and muted colors that make it seem like the camera lens was smeared with mud. The only thing <em>Dumbo </em>has going for it is that the elephant is really, really cute.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60c9cdd04ad8af6bad4386dafec0a09b" data-recommend-id="image://60c9cdd04ad8af6bad4386dafec0a09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alice stands with the white rabbit.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> On the surface, a Disney live-action remake of<em> Alice in Wonderland</em> seems like a perfect fit for Tim Burton. While the 2010 <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>has everything that makes a Tim Burton movie so uniquely his—enchanting yet strange character designs, a Victorian Gothic aesthetic, and exquisitely-detailed, surrealistic sets—it still somehow manages to be lackluster. </p><p>The film’s standouts are its main characters, whose spooky qualities contribute to a more twisted version of Wonderland. Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter, with his pale face, bright green eyes, and orange frizzy hair, resembles a crazed clown, while Helena Bonham Carter’s Red Queen has a giant CGI head to emphasize her haughtiness. Tweedledee and Tweedledum, with their eerie sunken eyes and rotund bodies supported by tiny, thin legs, recall The Penguin from <em>Batman</em>. But this version of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> attempts to inject a bland, #girlpower brand of feminism into Alice’s character. She becomes a warrior leading boring battle sequences set against dull grayish hues. </p><p>This type of expansion on the original narrative, often in service of creating stronger female characters, would become a hit-or-miss trend in future Disney live-action adaptations. Despite all the visual abundance,<em> Alice in Wonderland</em> falls short. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d76181fc41058132e57d15f640445508" data-recommend-id="image://d76181fc41058132e57d15f640445508" data-format="webp" data-width="1440" data-height="959" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The peculiar children stand together.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The cover of Ransom Riggs’ book <em>Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children</em> looks exactly like a Tim Burton movie: black and white, featuring a creepy Victorian child, and bare, bent trees in the background. The book and movie follows a young boy who discovers a group of children with paranormal abilities known as the “Peculiars,” and their time-looping caretaker who can transform into a peregrine falcon. As Miss Alma Lefay Peregrine, Eva Green has a quiet, intense presence that makes her performances hypnotic to watch. Emma Purcell, playing a girl who can manipulate air, is another highlight, her expressive, owl-like eyes convey an earnestness that drives the story forward. </p><p>In Burton’s hands, the Hollowgast villains are transformed into surreal, nightmarish creatures with pale bodies, eyeless heads, sharp teeth, and multiple pointed tongues. While the imaginative premise, peculiar characters, and Victorian mansion setting are undeniably Burtonesque, there are too many plot and pacing issues. <em>Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children</em> feels rushed and uncaring in the emotions of what’s happening on screen, merely hitting the story beats of the YA phenomenon to set it up for future sequels. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="baa672231ad12cf2f5093bc947a1546d" data-recommend-id="image://baa672231ad12cf2f5093bc947a1546d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pee-wee hitchhikes.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pee-wee scared me as a young child, so I was never a big fan of <em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em>, though I know it’s a nostalgic favorite for many. Paul Reubens’s over-the-top performance as the optimistic boy who never grew up and in search of his bicycle was too grating; his wild antics, such as dancing for a motorcycle gang or sneaking onto a Warner Bros. lot, were too goofy. But as Tim Burton’s debut feature film, it’s an important showcase for the quirky aesthetic he would soon become famous for. The dream sequences in particular, with killer clowns and a stop-motion T. Rex, have the kind of scary playfulness that foreshadow his later work. <em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em> has a relentless childlike absurdity that many find charming—especially younger audiences. But if you don’t find Pee-wee funny or cute, there’s not much here aside from the eye-popping special effects. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3f28aa5eeaaa319f29ac90598114db1" data-recommend-id="image://a3f28aa5eeaaa319f29ac90598114db1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy Adams holds a painting.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Big Eyes</em> is a biopic of a misunderstood artist, and while it doesn’t hit the emotional or visual highs of<em> Ed Wood</em>, it’s anchored by a nuanced performance from Amy Adams as Margaret Keane, the real woman behind the famous paintings of sappy-eyed children (her abusive husband, Walter Keane, passed himself off as the true artist). It’s the little moments that make Amy Adams’ performance, everything she doesn’t say as she tightens her lips or the flickering disappointment in her eyes over her husband’s lies. Once again, Tim Burton uses color to communicate the story’s emotions: the joys of their early marriage are bathed in saturated colors but become darker with cooler tones during their conflicts over the paintings. It’s refreshing to see Tim Burton explore the intimate lives of ordinary people; he does it so well that one wishes he would more often.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b4d4d9bd026e7989247ccc4477c4447" data-recommend-id="image://3b4d4d9bd026e7989247ccc4477c4447" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Willy Wonka stands with the chocolate factory guests.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some may say it’s sacrilegious to prefer Tim Burton’s <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> over the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder, but Tim Burton’s style is perfectly suited for the story of a young boy who wins a contest to explore a mysterious candy maker’s factory. Tim Burton lovingly crafts Willy Wonka’s vast candy palace with built sets instead of CGI, filling them with bright, green grass, giant candy cane trees, and a chocolate waterfall. All the sweet goodies look glossy and almost too perfect to be real. Burton creates a striking contrast between the wondrous factory and the drab, industrial town in which it resides, with Charlie’s thatched house exaggeratedly leaning to one side. </p><p>With a lighthearted voice and fussiness, Johnny Depp creates a version of Willy Wonka that is less psychopathic than Gene Wilder’s. He’s funnier and has more emotional depth, more like a socially inept, overgrown child with daddy issues. We sympathize with him as we learn more about his traumatic childhood and strained relationship with his father, played by the great Christopher Lee. </p><p>Instead of the horrifying, hypnotic drone from the original, Burton’s Oompa-Loompa musical sequences are catchy and fun, using a variety of genres from heavy metal to hippie folk. <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> uses pre-existing material that was perfect for the Burton’s brand of childlike wonder and weirdness. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1776d39dd917fa1ab6817afab2adb86f" data-recommend-id="image://1776d39dd917fa1ab6817afab2adb86f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The corpse bride stands with her new hsuband.

Johnny Depp sounds so different from his other roles as the shy and skittish Victor who, shortly before his arranged marriage, accidentally marries a dead socialite named Emily. She brings him to the very lively Land of the Dead, filled with bright green, purple, and blue hues, toe-tapping musical numbers, and kooky skeleton characters (including an adorable dead dog named Scraps). </p><p>Burton clearly enjoys juxtaposing this surprisingly upbeat world with the dour, stuffy grays of Victorian England. <em>Corpse Bride </em>features all kinds of creative, gross-out humor, such as a maggot that pops out of Emily’s eye socket. Many of the deceased characters in <em>Corpse Bride</em> resemble the way they died, such as a pair of generals with cannon holes and swords in their stomachs—Victor’s bumbling and terrified interactions with them are hilarious. </p><p>There’s also very moving moments, like Emily’s murder by her fiancé for her fortune. Helena Bonham Carter’s feathery voice conveys a wounded young woman, and her singing is beautifully haunting. One particularly touching scene with butterflies will bring you to tears. <em>Corpse Bride</em> is funny yet melancholy, creepy yet cute, and a whole lot of fun. It proves that kids can enjoy dark stories, too. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee022b26363c798a5efd6096d3efd87b" data-recommend-id="image://ee022b26363c798a5efd6096d3efd87b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="930" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Batman runs down the steps of a museum.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tim Burton’s flamboyant, Gothic style is perfect for bringing the shadowy city of Gotham to life in <em>Batman</em>. Burton transforms Gotham into a living, breathing urban jungle that perfectly matches Bruce Wayne’s tortured self. The cramped buildings with sharp spires and bold facades are reminiscent of German Expressionist movies such as Fritz Lang’s <em>Metropolis </em>and F. W. Murnau’s <em>The Last Laugh</em>. </p><p>Despite the exaggerated sets, <em>Batman </em>is grounded by Michael Keaton’s performance; he shades Batman and Bruce Wayne with a blend of coolness, toughness, and vulnerability. His soft, composed Batman voice indicates a hidden strength and steady confidence that other actors playing Batman rarely have. Jack Nicholson, of course, is iconic as the Joker, delivering a wonderfully ostentatious performance with his trademark cheeky smile; he behaves like the manic ringleader of a twisted circus. </p><p>It may not be the best <em>Batman </em>adaptation—that honor belongs to the Christopher Nolan trilogy—but it has a darkly atmospheric look thanks to Burton’s direction that effectively taps into the pulpy aspects of the comic book.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1af5ca553c401d05891f71bcf781d290" data-recommend-id="image://1af5ca553c401d05891f71bcf781d290" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

After discovering their child has physical differences, a snooty rich couple dumps his cradle in a freezing river—on Christmas, no less! Backed by the eerie choir of Danny Elfman’s score, it travels down to the grimy sewers where penguins wander.The film is defined by this type of cruelty, particularly in Danny DeVito’s Penguin. He is a loud, brash character with a grotesque appearance—lumpy and misshapen with a beak-like nose. His short and round features, waddling walk, and volatile outbursts make him seem more animal-like than human.</p><p>DeVito’s campy performance is the true highlight of <em>Batman Returns</em>, along with Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, of course. Her performance is delightfully unhinged and exudes eroticism, particularly in her BDSM-esque leather suit and enjoyment of tying people up. The movie has cartoony elements, like the Penguin driving a giant duck car, but there’s also intense violence where he bites off a man’s nose and blood oozes in between his teeth; another man is electrocuted, his white eyes popping out of his burnt, crispy flesh. </p><p><em>Batman Returns</em> is far more interesting and visually dynamic than the first because it leans into a certain kind of loony ugliness that only Tim Burton could create.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c89fc4577133c1007624c49ab3ad2278" data-recommend-id="image://c89fc4577133c1007624c49ab3ad2278" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Sleepy Hollow cast stands together.

The images of plunging bodice necklines, gnarled trees, misty roads, and thatched-roof cottages create a dark and detailed period film. Every shot is drenched in somber grays and blacks, giving all of the characters ghostly facial hues while making the rivers of blood in this very gory movie pop off the screen. </p><p>Johnny Depp’s performance is a big part of what makes <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> work so well as a vibrant mix of campiness, black humor, and genuine terror. He fully embodies the persnickety Ichabod Crane who believes more in science than the supernatural. He has a toolkit of bizarre inventions, including a set of bug-like eyepieces that he likes to fiddle with, but he gets sick having to conduct autopsies and wound examinations of the headless victims. <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> builds to a thrilling climax with Christopher Walken as the evil Headless Horseman.&nbsp;</p><p>As one of Tim Burton’s best, <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> is one of the few horror movies where you have lots of fun but also get chills.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06aa98f9a7977b6523598b7a82253eba" data-recommend-id="image://06aa98f9a7977b6523598b7a82253eba" data-format="jpg" data-width="512" data-height="288" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett sit together at the beach.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street </em>resembles Sleepy Hollow in its meticulous period detail and dreary, overcast colors—the red blood from slashed throats is brighter than anything on screen. Johnny Depp stars as Sweeney Todd, a man who loses his wife and daughter to the evil Judge Turpin and returns from imprisonment in Australia seeking vengeance. </p><p>Depp’s singing voice has a rock and roll edge that really works for the character and articulates his raw, heartbroken rage. Sweeney forms a devious partnership with Mrs. Lovett, murdering his barbershop clients and turning them into meat pies in preparation for his reckoning with Turpin. Helena Bonham Carter’s vocals, on the other hand, are far too soft and weak for a character as brash as Mrs. Lovett. </p><p>Burton adds a touch of his whimsical flair to some of the scenes, particularly Mrs. Lovett’s fantasy “By the Sea” where <em>Sweeney Todd</em> wears a Beetlejuice-esque black and white bathing suit. All of the musical numbers have this type of creative vision and fluid and dynamic camera movements. <em>Sweeney Todd </em>is a killer mix of horror, black humor, and melodrama, and one of Burton’s bests.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="345da1f221c90ae594e6c08b3d113164" data-recommend-id="image://345da1f221c90ae594e6c08b3d113164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frankenweenie looks at his owner.

Ironically, Disney ended up firing Tim Burton for making a kids film that was too frightening, but in 2012, Tim Burton was able to make a 3D, stop-motion version of his short. </p><p>The new <em>Frankenweenie </em>is sophisticated and touching, reflecting Tim Burton’s many years as a seasoned filmmaker. The sharp, black-and-white visuals make the impressive quality of the puppets really stand out, particularly the odd little children with giant saucer eyes and little dots for pupils, and the adorable, energetic Sparky. </p><p>Set in 1957, the monochromatic <em>Frankenweenie </em>serves as a tender homage to the classic monster movies that inspired Tim Burton growing up. <em>Frankenweenie </em>has a childlike sensibility with its morbid and gross humor, but there’s also a sweetness that comments on the special bond between children and their pets. It’s a wonderful family film that was clearly made with Tim Burton’s heart and soul. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="64d94308ef11064e299587ca5a71266f" data-recommend-id="image://64d94308ef11064e299587ca5a71266f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ed Wood sits in the director chair.

Ed Wood was a Hollywood outcast who directed fiascos with threadbare budgets and past-their-peak movie stars. As Ed Wood, Johnny Depp brings a determined cheerfulness to the role that is difficult to resist. The scenes of Ed’s on-the-fly movie-making are hilarious, showing a director who likes to shoot everything in one take, no matter what. He just enjoys the process of making a movie! The emotional heart of the film is Ed Wood’s relationship with Bela Lugosi, a formerly famous horror actor struggling with drug issues, played by a superb Martin Landau. Ed Wood’s life story was a perfect match for a Tim Burton film because he has such an affection for outsiders. That tenderness and care shines through in Burton’s treatment of this unique slice of Hollywood history.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="49397c0f5d790a4fbdf31f17d524b4f9" data-recommend-id="image://49397c0f5d790a4fbdf31f17d524b4f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beetlejuice smiles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beetlejuice smiles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Michael Keaton delivers an unforgettable performance as the title character, completely transforming himself with a spastic walk, electric-socket hair, and peeling green skin. He is an uncouth showman whose evilness manifests in irreverent humor and boundary-crossing antics. All of the characters in <em>Beetlejuice </em>are striking, and the performances are equally memorable, from Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the ghost couple, to Catherine O’Hara as the melodramatic sculptor, and Winona Ryder as the enigmatic teenage Lydia.</p><p><em>Beetlejuice</em> is a delightfully absurd and creative romp that depicts the sunny, all-American innocence of suburbia with a macabre twist, topped off with demon-possession musical numbers by Harry Belafonte It’s this oddball mix that not only makes it a great movie, but a Halloween favorite.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a03fe76d5b1c8279d0b32c73d0f8052" data-recommend-id="image://8a03fe76d5b1c8279d0b32c73d0f8052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward Bloom stands in a field of flowers.

Edward loves to share colorful stories about his life kissing mermaids, catching a massive fish, meeting a giant at the circus, and witnessing his future in the glass eye of a witch, all of which are visual spectacles full of fantastical settings, vibrant colors, and dreamlike details. </p><p>After dazzling us with whimsy and setting up the core problem (Edward’s son, William, played by Billy Crudup, is tired of his father’s tall tales), <em>Big Fish</em> reaches a highly emotional climax that solidifies the film as one of Tim Burton’s best. Beautiful and sentimental, <em>Big Fish</em> reminds us of the importance of family and sharing memories and stories with one another so our legacy lives on. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-recommend-id="image://361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward wields his bladed fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edward wields his bladed fingers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-recommend-id="image://361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward wields his bladed fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Edward Scissorhands </em>is Tim Burton’s crowning achievement, marking a significant departure from his more comic or action-oriented films that gives the eccentric aesthetic he’s known for a profound emotional gravitas. It’s also the first time Tim Burton worked with Johnny Depp, who would go on to star in seven more of his films. </p><p>Depp plays a young man with scissors for hands who is taken in by a kindhearted Avon lady. With minimal dialogue and an unassuming presence, his performance resembles a silent film actor’s. In frequent close-ups, Johnny Depp communicates so much through his sad brown eyes: confusion, child-like innocence, a broken soul. Winona Ryder plays the blonde cheerleader whom Edward falls for, and their unspoken, empathetic connection draws you into the classic story of an ostracized “beast” falling for a beauty. </p><p>Unlike Tim Burton’s other films, which often emphasize the comedic elements of his fanciful settings, this one juxtaposes the monotonous rows of pastel-colored houses with the ink-black Gothic castle where Edward lives to make thoughtful observations on societal rejection of outsiders and people with differences. There are so many moments that feel straight out of a storybook, such as when Kim twirls in the “snow” created by Edward, accompanied by Danny Elfman’s enchanting choral score. </p><p><em>Edward Scissorhands</em> is not only Tim Burton’s best film, but one of the greatest modern fairy tales ever told.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Black Myth: Wukong will receive two DLC expansions before the release of its sequel, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As revealed by <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1830597658450305497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lunatic Ignus</a> on their Discord server, developer Game Science aims to release two DLC expansions for their first game. What these expansions will focus on hasn't been revealed, but the leaker's source discovered audio files for Buddha, Jade Emperor, and Nezha, who is said to have a bigger role in the studio's next game. According to the leaker, the release of the two expansions makes sense, as Game Science originally wanted Black Myth: Wukong to feature 13 chapters, which were eventually reduced.</p>
<p>The leaker could not say precisely when these DLC expansions will be released, but they did say that they are coming after the Xbox port and physical copies are out. An announcement will likely be made during Summer 2025, possibly on August 20th, which would be the game's first anniversary.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Black-Myth-Wukong-DLC.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lunatic Ignus has proven somewhat reliable in the past few months, so there could be some truth in what they have revealed today. Still, as with every rumor, we have to take what has been revealed about Black Myth: Wukong and its sequel, codenamed Black Myth: Jiang Ziya, with a grain of salt until an official announcement comes in, which could take a while, considering the game was released two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. The Xbox Series X|S version of the game is currently in the works but is rumored to be delayed indefinitely due to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/">critical technical issue</a>. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>

<p>Fortnite is a game that has completely revolutionised the free-to-play battle royale genre. The game burst into the scene in 2017 and has been one of the most played ever since. Fortnite also has a massive presence in the global esports scene, with some of its tournaments considered the best in the industry. If you wish to learn more about Fortnite esports, this guide has everything you need.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fortnite-an-esports-game">Is Fortnite an Esports Game?</h2>



<p>Fortnite is a free-to-play, multiplayer battle royale game, and this genre of games typically does well in the esports sector. The game was released in 2017, but it wasn’t in the esports ecosystem until Chapter 1 Season 4 in 2018, and it wasn’t until the Fortnite World Cup in 2019 that the game gained proper traction in this industry. Since then, we have seen a host of Fortnite esports tournaments each year, boasting multi-million prize pools and featuring some of the best Fortnite players and teams.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-fortnite-tournaments">Best Fortnite Tournaments</h2>



<p>For any game to become popular in the esports scene, it needs to have some iconic competitions to show for it, and Fortnite has a whole roster under its belt. Every year, players will see the best Fortnite teams battle it out to get the most significant chunk of the million-dollar prize pool, gaining tremendous respect and fame along the way. Here are some of the best Fortnite esports tournaments:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS)</strong> is the top-tier competitive league hosted annually.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Private Tournaments</strong> are&nbsp;second-tier competitions hosted by content creators or private organisations.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Cash Cups</strong> are weekly online competitions for high-ranked players to earn cash prizes.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Limited Time Events</strong>: These are special events generally created per the occasion. </li>



<li><strong>Esports World Cup</strong>: Fortnite is a part of the Esports World Cup in the battle royale category.</li>
</ul>

<p>Teams keep interchanging; players who were once foes have now become allies. However, the top organisations have primarily remained the same.

<h2 id="h-how-are-fortnite-esports-played">How are Fortnite esports played?</h2>



<p>Tournaments are generally played across three game modes: Build, Zero Build and Ranked. The way to earn rewards is by placing high on the leaderboard, which can be done by scoring during matches. There are three categories to gain points across these competitions: kills, survival and wins. The competitions are usually hosted for a limited time, and the teams that score the highest on the leaderboard are dubbed the winners.&nbsp;Moreover, these tournaments also have their custom loot pools and rulesets. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-bet-on-fortnite-esports">Can you bet on Fortnite esports?</h2>



<p>Fortnite is a regular in the esports betting industry, just like several other famous battle royale titles. Most betting interest is generated from North America and the United Kingdom.

            <p>The official social media accounts for Tony Hawk Pro Skater have been freshened up ahead of the series' upcoming 25th anniversary - and it's got some fans very excited.</p>
<p>Whilst news that YouTube, X/Twitter, and Facebook are getting a commemorative banner may not sound all that newsworthy, interestingly, all images now boast a new <a href="https://x.com/shepardzorel/status/1830355110007865355?s=46">2024 copyright notice</a>, suggesting Activision has recently renewed the copyright of the series… and that's the bit that's sent the rumour mill into overdrive.</p>

<p>Perhaps most noteworthy of all, however, is news that Activision is marking the series' 25th anniversary "all month long"... leading some to hope that the 3 and 4 remasters could be unveiled sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Whilst Pro Skater 1 and 2 received remakes a little while back, fans lost out on the planned remake of 3 and 4 after Vicarious Visions was merged with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> in 2022 (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-updates-socials-for-25th-anniversary-fans-hoping-for-game-announcement/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>And if Spyro is anything to go by, fans could be right. Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toys-for-bob-website-update-leads-to-new-crash-bandicoot-or-spyro-speculation">a new tweet from the official Spyro the Dragon Twitter/X account</a> - and then a website update - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-spyro-the-dragon-tweet-has-fans-thinking-a-new-instalment-is-coming">sparked hopes that a new instalment could be on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, footage from a cancelled futuristic Call of Duty sci-fi game that had been in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-call-of-duty-sci-fi-game-from-tony-hawks-studio-neversoft-leaks-online">development by Tony Hawk's studio Neversoft leaked online</a>.</p>
<p>The footage came from a cancelled Xbox 360-era Call of Duty game known as Future Warfare (or "NX1" internally). The game was originally in development at Neversoft, which was ultimately merged into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> in 2014.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/2/24234091/microsoft-windows-11-popular-steam-pc-gaming-survey<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft’s Windows 11 operating system has passed Windows 10 usage for Steam users for the first time since its launch in 2021. Windows 10 has been holding strong in recent years, despite Microsoft’s plans to end support for Windows 10 in October 2025. There are now signs that Windows 11 adoption is finally heading in the right direction for Microsoft.</p><p>Steam hardware <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fhwsurvey%2FSteam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">survey data for August</a> puts Windows 11 usage at 49 percent, an increase of more than 3 percent over the previous figure in July of nearly 46 percent. Windows 10 usage has dipped by around 3 percent to 47 percent, while macOS and Linux Steam usage has largely remained the same during August.</p><p>Usage of Windows 11 across the web has also been growing over the past year, too. In July 2023, Windows 11 had a market share of around 23 percent, and that has now grown to nearly 32 percent in August 2024, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide">according to StatCounter</a>.</p><p>Leaked data in October revealed Windows 11 was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922062/microsoft-windows-11-400-million-active-devices-usage-data-leak">used by more than 400 million devices</a> at the time, a slower adoption pace than Windows 10. It took Windows 10 a year to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/26/13057980/microsoft-windows-10-400-million-devices">reach 400 million active devices</a>, whereas it took Windows 11 two years to reach that same milestone. The discrepancy is partially due to upgrade eligibility for Windows 11. Microsoft first launched Windows 11 in October 2021 with strict hardware requirements, requiring a TPM security chip and CPUs released from 2018 onwards.</p><p>While Windows 11 was a free upgrade for Windows 10 users, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response">millions of machines were left behind</a> and unable to upgrade due to Microsoft’s hardware requirements. Windows 10 was offered as a free upgrade to Windows 7 and Windows 8 users, and it didn’t have such strict restrictions on hardware so millions were able to upgrade instead of having to buy new devices.</p><p>Microsoft is now planning to charge businesses to continue using Windows 10 after its end of support in October 2025. Consumers will also be able to pay for additional security updates for Windows 10 for the first time ever, but Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24120093/microsoft-windows-10-extended-security-updates-price">only shared business pricing</a> so far.</p><div>

As revealed by Nintendo this weekend, the two open-world games that bookended the Switch’s lifespan stand alone in their own version of reality. Which means all that time you spent trying to work out how they fit in with the previous games was <em>futile</em>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196698,195719" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The idea that the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games exist in some sort of coherent timeline has always struck me as a path that leads to madness. Think too hard on something like that and you’re surely only moments away from drawing spirals all over your walls and ceiling.

There are two previously established distinct timelines in official <em>Zelda </em>cannon, known as “Hero is Defeated” and “Hero is Triumphant,” which branch off after the events of <em>Ocarina of Time. </em>The latter branch immediately splits into “Child Era” and “Adult Era,” while <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> just sit awkwardly off to the side, not fitting in anywhere.</p><p>According to the slide, chronologically the first game is <em>Skyward Sword</em>, followed by <em>The Minish Cap</em> and <em>Four Swords</em>, before everything splits after <em>Ocarina</em>. This also means that the two most “recent” games end up being the very first ones, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em>, both set in the “Era of Decline.” But the Switch’s epic adventures just float loose, not even chronologically connected to one another.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this official timeline doesn’t mention <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-trailer-horse-1851613081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-trailer-horse-1851613081"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a></span> at all.</p><p>Surely it’s easier to refuse to even countenance any of this, and to think of <em>Zelda</em> as this big box of toys, and Nintendo gets them all out and plays with them differently every time? Sure, there’s the Link toy and the Zelda toy and the Gannon toy, and they play on the same cloth map, but there’s no reason to want or need them to overlap or interconnect at all. At least, that’s how <em>I</em> stay sane.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been reported that Rocksteady has laid off over half of its QA department as a part of the studio’s restructuring.</p>



<p>The report comes from Eurogamer, who understands that the QA department has been reduced from 33 to just 15, with the company citing its “restructuring” for the reason to let people go.</p>



<p>According to the outlet, those affected go beyond just QA staff, too, with some now former employees reporting on social media that they’ve been let go. Lead Recruiter at Rocksteady, Alexandar Bell, took to LinkedIn to say, “I suspect I’ve just joined a very exclusive cohort of people who’ve been told their role is being eliminated whilst on a paternity leave.”</p>



<p>In August 2024, Warner Bros. reported that the company had seen a 41% decline in gaming revenue year-on-year and had said that the company had lost $200 million on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, In 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 11,700 people</a>&nbsp;have been impacted by layoffs in the gaming industry across at least 130 companies.</p>



<p>Rocksteady and Warner Bros. are yet to comment officially on the latest layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-performance-7700-xt/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's performance is expected to be in the ballpark of the Radeon 7700 XT GPU, but with some improvements in ray tracing performance, according to a well-known leaker.</p>
<p>Setting expectations in check, well-known AMD leaker Kepler revealed on <a href="https://x.com/Kepler_L2/status/1829466208145494016">X</a> that the new console's performance is close to the 7700 XT in rasterization and slightly faster in ray tracing. This information falls in line with everything we have heard so far, as the console is said to bring a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/">significant ray tracing performance improvemen</a>t over the base model.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation 5 Pro reveal supposedly getting closer and closer, more information on the console started emerging online in the past few days. According to well-known leaker billbil-kun, the console's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">design won't be too different from that of the base model</a>, as shown on the system's packaging. Additionally, it is not yet known if the console will be released with a disc drive, as the packaging the leaker saw was for a digital-only edition of the system.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's reveal is rumored to be coming this month. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more comes in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>About a year ago, publisher Fulqrum and developer Dreamate <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> New Arc Line, a new cRPG set in a setting that mixes steampunk with magic and fantasy. Its premise and features have intrigued me from the get-go, so I was very interested in checking it out at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>It was originally billed as a hands-on demo, but it turned out to be a presentation. Still, I learned quite a few new things about the game, which is still slated to launch before the end of the year on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a> (the console versions may come later, as you'll read below).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the conflict between magic and technology is at the very core of the idea behind New Arc Line. In the past, mages and technologists were in actual wars, and the mages lost. Technologists became the ruling class. Mages are still present in the world, and their culture is still there, but they've been relegated to the outskirts of society.</p>
<p>There's also a rampant disease called Iron Plague that started during the magotechnology wars. However, no one knows how it spreads, let alone how to find a cure. The afflicted inevitably turn into metal, and they slowly die. In the demo, the developers showed a Leprosarium, a hospital for patients who have contracted this deadly disease. The head doctor was missing, while another doctor called Bailey tasked us with bringing three patients in.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Early access on PC and then full release later on the other platforms is one of the options that's being considered.'</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is located in the poorest part of the city, where Mages live. Right away, the developer shows off some interactive elements, such as the ability to examine the nearby ambulance and gather useful items after passing the dice roll. Rounding up the three patients requires a mix of combat and dialogue persuasion. New Arc Line has turn-based combat; every character has different initiative stats, so every fight will have a different order of events. In every turn, you have a limited amount of movement points and action points. Each ability uses up a different number of action points, so you have to strategize around that, of course.</p>
<p>For the demonstration, the developer played as a Voodoo Mage since it pairs well with the only companion at this stage of the game, Mick, a giant that goes into melee. Voodoo Mages have many abilities and spells that let them control the battlefield by cursing the enemy. As an example, when outnumbered, the Voodoo Mage can put down a taunt totem that sets up a distraction. If the foes fail the save roll, they will be forced to attack the totem instead of the party. Voodoo Mages can also use the Soulbind spell, which binds two enemies together; on success, whenever one takes damage, the other takes it as well.</p>
<p>Unlocking new abilities works differently for technology classes and for magical classes. The technology process is all about equipment. New abilities are dictated by what weapons you have, and there's also a crafting system, so you don't just have to rely on what you loot, but you can craft your own and update what you already have. Mages, on the other hand, obtain new spells by collecting magical cards and combining them in a system called Magecraft. That's a parallel of the crafting system with which you will be making your own spells.</p>
<p>Of course, both technologists and mages share a leveling system through XP. You can also improve your skills and your fighting ability in general and at certain levels, you will also be able to select perks. The selection of perks is molded by the choices you make in the world and how you approach different classes and different tasks. That lets you build up the character the way you want.</p>
<p>The presenter of the demo also stressed that upon failing skill checks, the game imitates life. That is to say, when you fail, it's almost never the end; the quest will go on, and the outcome will be different. You can, of course, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game#Savescumming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">savescumming</a> tactics and reload until you succeed, even when you have just a 1 percent chance, if that's the way you want to play. There's no police, nobody will stop you from doing so, but you can also just go forward as it is.</p>
<p>After convincing those three Iron Plague patients to head to the Leprosarium, the presenter went back there and found out the head doctor, instead of treating the patients and researching the disease as we were thinking, was actually running an underground fighting ring.</p>
<p>He put his patients against one another for the amusement of literally class and made quite a lot of money out of it. In his defense, he claimed that all the patients joining the fights did so voluntarily, that he was not forcing them, and that he was giving them a share of the profit.</p>
<p>Doctor Bailey is, however, completely against that. She wants to return the hospital to the original purpose of researching the Iron Plague in the hope that she may find, if not a cure, maybe some treatment to alleviate suffering. The player can either walk away and let the doctors sort it out among themselves or side with one of the two. Siding with the head doctor will provide the added bonus of a cut of his underground fighting ring's profits.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Arc Line | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrZWTKEkZLk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There's one more system in New Arc Line when it comes to the conflict between magic and technology. Every region in the world has a different affinity, either towards magic or technology, and they compete against each other. Your decisions and your actions also influence this, so you can turn this world that's largely technological more towards magic.</p>
<p>You might want to do that or not because when a Mage casts spells that are more powerful than the local region allows, they accumulate Mage corruption points. Upon gaining enough corruption, you progress to the next tier. Lowering the level of corruption can be done with consumables, but to get to a lower tier, you need special encounters. It's very complicated to do that. It's not always bad. Every tier gives you certain new abilities, so there are positives as well, but it's something you need to keep in mind. By the way, if you do side with magic, then the advanced technology of your technology classes might stop working or backfire.</p>
<p>Following this interesting presentation, I spoke with Michal Černoch, Marketing Manager at Fulqrum Publishing, for a brief Q&amp;A about New Arc Line.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Your goal is to find a cure for the Iron Plague, for the family that you left back home. You moved to the city because you heard of the rumors that there is a cure. That's what you want, that's what you're looking for.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are the rules inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons?</strong></p>
<p>We don't copy/paste the rules of any existing RPG. But yes, of course, inspiration is drawn from that, as well as the Baldur's Gate and Divinity: Original Sin series.</p>
<p><strong>Are there attacks of opportunity when you're close to an enemy and they move?</strong></p>
<p>That's the other way around here. You don't just have action points but also reaction points. When you are attacked, you get a chance to use those points to react so you can counterattack, depending on the character's build.</p>
<p><strong>You said there is leveling, right? Did you settle on a level cap already or is it still to be decided?</strong></p>
<p>It's one of the design decisions that's still being worked on.</p>
<p><strong>Can you stay in the middle between magic and technology or do you have to absolutely choose between one or the other?</strong></p>
<p>You have to choose if you want to play as a Magic user or technologist, but with all other choices in the world, you don't have to go to extremes. You can also try to avoid the conflict as much as possible and, quite often, just walk away and not get involved.</p>
<p>Your goal is to find a cure for the Iron Plague, for the family that you left back home. You moved to the city because you heard of the rumors that there is a cure. That's what you want, that's what you're looking for. You can stick to that.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe there is a way that magic and technology can coexist.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, that won't be the case. There's always conflict; it's inherent in the world, and you can't solve that now. They can coexist in the sense that Mages have not died out after the technology wars when they were defeated. But one side will always have the upper hand.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to have any voice over for dialogues in New Arc Line?</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes, not for every dialogue in every quest and every character, but we have quite thorough voiceovers, especially for the main events.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Yes, there are companions that you can romance, and it'll of course, depend on the character you create and the choices you make. They could potentially leave the party if they don't like what you're doing.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you have relationships with your companions, like in Baldur's Gate 3?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are companions that you can romance, and it'll of course, depend on the character you create and the choices you make.</p>
<p><strong>Would they potentially leave your party if they don't agree with what you're doing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a day/night cycle?</strong></p>
<p>No, no, there's no day/night cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explore the city freely from the start of the game, or do you have to wait to progress in the story?</strong></p>
<p>You open up new areas by completing certain quests and tasks, but it's up to you in what order you do it, so there's a lot of freedom. In the very beginning, you will be a little bit steered on your way, but as you progress, you will have more and more freedom, and it'll be up to you.</p>
<p><b>So, is there a lot of side content?</b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an estimate for the average playthrough length of New Arc Line?</strong></p>
<p>That's really hard to say. Every estimate has also been changing as we've been developing new mechanics and content. Also it depends a lot how you play a game. You can spend hours exploring and diving deep into the lore, so yeah, it's really hard to give an estimate on that, but it's not going to be a short game by any means. We're not talking five hours. Around 20 or more is the target.</p>
<p><strong>How many classes are there?</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, there are six classes to choose from. Three technologists (Steampunk brawler, Dieselpunk engineer, and Teslapunk scientist) and three magical classes (Voodoo Mage, the Hellfire Mage, which is more direct damage oriented, and the Celestial, which is the support type of character). Through leveling and building out the character, you will also get to our prestige classes to further customize them.</p>

<p><strong>How big is the party? How many companions can you bring in combat at once?</strong></p>
<p>It's three companions you can have at the party plus yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a camp where you go talk to them, or can you just talk to them anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>You can talk to them anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Did you set a release window for New Arc Line?</strong></p>
<p>The development team is in Ukraine, so you can imagine it's difficult. We're still aiming for this year. We're exploring different options for releasing the game, but we are aiming for a release in 2024. We should actually have a better idea in just a few weeks, so we'll be making an announcement soon.</p>
<p><strong>So it could be released as an early access game?</strong></p>
<p>It is one of the options we are considering, but it's not decided yet. It will eventually come out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Early access on PC and then full release later on the other platforms is one of the options that's being considered.</p>
<p><strong>Does the game already support controllers on PC with a dedicated UI?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know that we have tested that yet. I'd have to find out from the production team.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

It might speculate about the nature of the human race, and what lies beyond our limited knowledge of the universe around us. It might propose an alternate past or a potential future. It might introduce you to an extraterrestrial or a brand-new scientific concept. Good sci-fi lingers with you long after the credits roll, prompting you to spend hours running theories past your friends, or researching possibilities because you’re just <em>that </em>curious.<br></p><p>In order to collate the best science fiction movies, we had to narrow our view to even make this possible: the best in the last 50 years, which means any movie that came out since 1974. Yes, that means you won’t see <em>Forbidden Planet</em> or <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> or <em>Metropolis </em>on this list. But you will see classics like <em>Alien</em>, <em>Terminator</em>, and <em>The Thing</em>, and newer sci-fi sensations like <em>Ex Machina</em> and <em>Blade Runner: 2049</em>.<br></p><p>We got almost the entire <em>Kotaku</em> staff involved in this one, so click through to see our list of the 50 best science fiction movies of the last 50 years, <em>in alphabetical order</em>.<br></p></div></div><div><p><em>Akira </em>was probably one of the first sci-fi movies I ever watched, and it was the stuff of nightmares. My older brother watched it religiously since he was (and remains) a huge anime dork, meaning it absolutely plagued me. Numerous scenes from the movie are etched into my memory for what seems like the rest of my life, including Tetsuo’s grotesque transformation in his final battle against Kaneda, as well as the striking orbital laser that comes down to try and kill the former as he lays waste to Neo-Tokyo. For all intents and purposes, <em>Akira </em>was the baseline of what sci-fi could and should be in my life, and that set a really high standard early on.</p><p><em>Akira </em>is rightfully heralded as a classic for its heady themes, no-frills approach, and gorgeous animation. It is, after all, the origin of the beloved (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spiderman-2-mary-jane-watson-mj-akira-slide-ps5-1850931359&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spiderman-2-mary-jane-watson-mj-akira-slide-ps5-1850931359">and often imitated</a></span>) “<em>Akira </em>slide.” More than 30 years later, it’s one of the boldest films ever and hasn’t been matched, let alone overcome. Tons of sci-fi films posit questions about the efficacy and true role of the military, but I think few have the open disdain and grime of <em>Akira</em>. Neo-Tokyo may look sleek and cool, but it’s <em>the</em> template for the artifice of cyberpunk settings. Underneath it all, everything is rotten.<br></p><p>Besides the obvious reasons for <em>Akira</em>’s acclaim, I think it’s also pretty neat that my earliest exposure to the genre came from outside of the American bubble. I think it’s easy for folks to mistake any one view for the dominant perspective on a subject, but <em>Akira </em>instilled a sense early on that there is far more to the world, fiction, the future, and our anxieties than my few blocks, city, state, or country. <strong>— Moises Tavares</strong></p></div><div><p>There are very few films that come close to the splendor that is <em>Alien</em>—sci-fi or not. A stellar cast, a brilliant director, dialogue that feels so natural you feel like you’re one of the Nostromo’s crew members, beautiful sets that look like real, inhabited spaces, and horrifying practical effects, all set against the backdrop of a simple but effective premise: something alien has invaded a space, and there’s virtually nothing humans can do about it. It cuts to the core of many of the themes science fiction loves to unpack: the inevitable degradation of everything thanks to capitalism, human beings’ smallness in this universe, the horrors that lurk in parts unknown, the fallibility of humanity. It is pitch-perfect, the kind of science fiction film all other science fiction films strive to be.<br></p><p>If you’re looking for an even better explanation as to why Ridley Scott’s 1979 sci-fi horror masterpiece is on this list, may I point you to Carolyn Petit’s excellent write-up in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-movies-ranked-aliens-prometheus-predator-avp-1851621200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-movies-ranked-aliens-prometheus-predator-avp-1851621200">our rankings of the <em>Alien </em>films</a></span>. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Five years before he’d follow up his own sci-fi thriller, <em>The Terminator</em>, with a balls-to-the-wall action sequel, James Cameron gave Ridley Scott’s pulse-pounding sci-fi horror film <em>Alien </em>similar treatment, amping up the franchise’s firepower immensely and delivering one of the most influential action films of all time. Previously we’d seen a xenomorph tear through the hapless crew of the Nostromo and it was terrifying, but those were just ordinary working folks, not space marines armed with all the futuristic weaponry money can buy. Surely these perfect specimens would be no match for an entire crew of heavily armed future soldiers, right? Right?!</p><p><em>Aliens </em>takes the shadowy threat of the original film and makes it much more concrete, establishing that no matter what tools we may have at our disposal and how advantageous our position may seem, we are no match for the xenomorphs, and it does so through some of the loudest, most spectacular action scenes ever filmed. Crucially, however, it doesn’t lose the human element in all the bombast and carnage. Every actor makes his or her character vivid, distinct, and memorable, even those who get killed off early on, and we believe in the camaraderie and connection that binds the band of soldiers together. More than that, in the midst of it all, Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley finds a kind of family with Michael Biehn’s Hicks and young survivor Newt, a dynamic with themes that resonate in a film which also introduces the Alien Queen, who we see laying her many, many eggs in wonderfully graphic detail. Oh, and the first film’s themes of corporate fuckery and the expendability of human life are alive and well, with Paul Reiser showing surprising range as a delightfully sleazy representative of the Weyland-Yutani corporation who definitely does not die a very satisfying death.<strong>— Carolyn Petit </strong><br></p></div><div><p>As a Jeff VanderMeer fangirl, I was excited for Alex Garland’s <em>Annihilation</em>, inspired by VanderMeer’s novels,<em>&nbsp;</em>long before it debuted. In it, a mysterious barrier known only as the Shimmer (Area X in the books) that suddenly emerged from a lighthouse in the Florida panhandle is being studied by an incredibly suspicious government organization. Attempts to send manned patrols into the Shimmer have resulted in their disappearance, save for one person, Kane (Oscar Isaac) who returns seemingly unchanged but rapidly declines once leaving the space. His wife, Lena (Natalie Portman), a cellular biology professor and former soldier, joins an all-female expedition into the Shimmer, encountering mutated flora and fauna and much, much more. </p><p>Though the film deviates quite a bit from the source material (which is both a clever choice considering how bizarre the novel is <em>and</em> a metatextual analysis of the novel itself), <em>Annihilation</em> is incredible. It’s a film that forces you to question the nature of humanity and reckon with your truly baby-brained understanding of the world around you. It brilliantly twists the source material, mirroring what happens to all living organisms that cross this alien threshold, and really demonstrates Garland’s understanding of VanderMeer’s novels. The film is also beautifully surreal and incredibly well-acted, with a few truly horrifying moments that will leave you shaken to the core. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div><div><p><em>Arrival </em>has the distinct honor of being the only sci-fi flick that makes me weep uncontrollably. Starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, this saccharine drama focuses on the efforts of a translator charged with interpreting the language of an alien species that has arrived under mysterious, but seemingly peaceful, circumstances. There is no invasion, even if some of the larger forces in <em>Arrival</em>’s world would like to think of the situation in that way. Instead, Adams’ character, a linguist, does something much more difficult: She tries to understand the aliens and their utterly baffling language.</p><p>I love a good alien action movie, but I also really love a story willing to do a bit more work interrogating the nature of extraterrestrials, and by extension, ourselves. Humans are an incredibly divisive species, which might be why our first instinct is to meet something unfamiliar with cruel, blunt force. <em>Arrival </em>speaks to a more sensible side of our existence, one that is capable of more than violence, one that can offer curiosity and unifying love, and one that has the capacity to act on these notions in pursuit of something greater than ourselves. I don’t know, man, I just really love <em>Arrival</em> even if I find it hard to ever go back to. But I guess that’s great sci-fi, y’know? It haunts you, and <em>Arrival </em>definitely haunts me. <strong>— Moises Tavares</strong><br></p></div><div><p>A cult classic that put John Boyega on the map, <em>Attack the Block</em> is an incredibly British (and incredibly funny) sci-fi flick about an extraterrestrial invasion of a South London council estate. Brilliantly, <em>Attack the Block</em> asks and answers the question: what would a group of young kids trying to prove their street cred do when an alien pops up on the block and attacks one of them? And if they manage to kill it (spoiler: they do) what do they do after that? Bring it to their weed dealer, of course (played, hilariously, by Nick Frost). </p><p><em>Attack the Block</em> only gets more absurd from there, but cleverly weaves a strong emotional thread through the alien action, deftly handled by Boyega in his first-ever movie role. If you’re looking for a thoroughly enjoyable, fast-paced romp through South London complete with icky alien blood, <em>Attack the Block</em> is a must-see. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong> </p></div><div><p>One of the most innately crowd-pleasing movies of all time, <em>Back to the Future </em>takes a brilliant core concept (a time-traveling DeLorean designed by a kooky scientist!) and makes the absolute most of it with phenomenal performances, a stirring musical score, a sharp, hilarious script, gee-whiz special effects, and exceptional, propulsive direction by Robert Zemeckis. Moving effortlessly between sci-fi action, zany comedy, and moments of existential crisis and heartfelt connection, <em>Back to the Future </em>is an example of a story that can only be effectively told through the medium of cinema. Sure, its concept of how time travel works may not hold up to rigid scientific questioning, but it doesn’t need to. Cinema is a purely visual medium, and I’ll never forget that image of the photograph Marty carries with him that shows his siblings fading from existence, or the thrill of the lightning strike that sends the Delorean back to the future, leaving nothing but flaming tire tracks in its wake. <strong>— Carolyn Petit </strong></p></div><div><p>What can you say about <em>Blade Runner </em>that hasn’t already been said? It’s just such a rich, haunting, atmospheric, meaningful, and multifaceted film, one you can appreciate purely as one of the great visual achievements in cinema history, or for its fascinating exploration of what it means to be human. As far as the art of cinema is concerned, it’s <em>Blade Runner</em>’s visual legacy that looms the largest. Itself heavily influenced by film noirs of the 1940s, complete with its trenchcoat-wearing, hard-drinking detective who talks to us in detached voiceover–at least in<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versions_of_Blade_Runner&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versions_of_Blade_Runner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the original theatrical release</a></span>–<em>Blade Runner</em>’s vision of 21st-century Los Angeles is perhaps the most iconic and inescapably influential fictional city ever put on film. </p><p>Every element of the production design, visual and audio, tantalizingly hints at a larger world. Consider, for instance, the dirigible glimpsed early in the film, telling Angelenos that “a new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.” In so many films, a detail like this would only be featured if it figured directly in the plot, something to be explained and elaborated upon. But here in <em>Blade Runner</em>, it’s just one of many stimuli competing for our attention, earning only a derisive look from Harrison Ford’s Rick Deckard before he turns back to his newspaper. </p><p>And yet it’s not <em>just </em>because of its incredibly immersive world that <em>Blade Runner </em>has endured for so long, only growing in prestige and earning millions of new admirers in the decades since its disappointing box office release. We keep coming back to <em>Blade Runner</em> for the spectacle, sure, but also for the alluring story at its center, one that remains fascinating precisely because it offers no easy answers to its central questions about the nature of being human. Instead, we can turn it over and over again in our minds like a dream, pondering how someday, for each and every one of us, all these moments will be lost, like tears in rain. <strong>— Carolyn Petit </strong><br></p></div><div><p>Every fan of Ridley Scott’s 1982 <em>Blade Runner</em> had some concerns about <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>. Scott’s original film is a masterpiece, and a sequel nearly 30 years later starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford and directed by Denis Villeneuve could have gone one of two ways. Luckily, it went the good route—though <em>2049</em> is a bit <em>too</em> in love with its source material (the concept: a blackout led to a replicant rebellion that destroyed the Tyrell company, with a new one cropping up in its place), Villeneuve’s singular vision makes for one of the most beautiful sci-fi movies to ever grace the screen. </p><p>Its biggest flaw is its failure to engage in social commentary around police brutality and economic inequality considering the world in which it’s set, but if you can put aside your frustration, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> is a visual feast with a heartbreaking romance at its center. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div><div><p>As we approach two decades since the release of <em>Children of Men</em>, the movie only gets more relevant. That’s not really a good thing considering the dystopian hell that is Alfonso Cuarón’s 2006 film. Starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam, <em>Children of Men </em>introduces audiences to a world in which the human race has become completely infertile and mass hysteria has turned governments like the United Kingdom into extremely xenophobic police states. The film’s portrayal of a world dominated by a government’s willingness to constantly torture their own people, who become become increasingly divided over extremist beliefs. It’s a plot that feels all-too-familiar in today’s political climate.<br></p><p>At the heart of all this horror however, is a story that does center on hope and the power of community. Watching Owen’s Theo bond with Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), the only known pregnant woman on Earth, is beautiful. On top of that, Cuarón makes <em>Children of Men</em> a gorgeous movie to watch despite its subject matter—like with an amazing, unforgettable unbroken shot that still takes my breath away. And for video game fans you can watch this knowing that it was a big inspiration for <em>The Last of Us</em>, for what that’s worth. <strong>— Willa Rowe</strong><br></p></div><div><p>1975’s <em>Jaws </em>wasn’t Steven Spielberg’s first film, but it was the one that announced the arrival of a major talent, one with a visual sensibility that would arguably change the movies forever. (After seeing <em>Jaws</em>, Alfred Hitchcock reportedly said that Spielberg is “the first one of us who doesn’t see the proscenium arch,” meaning that he and other directors of his own era came to cinema with a sensibility informed by the theater, and Spielberg didn’t have those constraints at all, instead seeing bold new possibilities for fluidity and framing.) But if <em>Jaws </em>indicated the arrival of a cinematic prodigy, his next film, 1977’s <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>, cemented it. I still think its UFOs are the most spectacular spacecraft I’ve ever seen in a movie, so vast and colorful, ships made for cinema. </p><p><em>Close Encounters </em>is a visual feast, a sci-fi adventure yarn, and a fascinating character study in the simultaneously life-saving and life-shattering impact that faith, yearning, and a search for greater meaning can have on our lives. It’s also a wonderfully personal film that brought together elements of Spielberg’s life in ways that, for a long time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ZspOEa1CP4A?si=TsHST61CCKYcxBfx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ZspOEa1CP4A?si=TsHST61CCKYcxBfx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he himself did not realize</a></span>.

Though she’s met with disbelief, scrutiny, and the threat of a full shutdown of her research, she doggedly persists, eventually discovering a signal that details the schematics for building a single-manned spaceship that can reach the place from whence the signal originated. <em>Contact </em>is an incredibly grounded sci-fi flick for nearly its entire runtime, before going absolutely balls-to-the-wall in the final act and ultimately presenting a fascinating question: how much of science is rooted in faith when our scientific instruments and/or theories prove to be inadequate? —<strong> Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Matt Reeves is better known these days for helming the most recent <em>Batman </em>flick, but once upon a time he gave us the best sci-fi blockbuster of the 2010s. That movie is <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em>, which really should’ve been the title of the first movie in the 2010s trilogy, but that is neither here nor there. I could try and give you a pitch, but instead I want to just describe my favorite sequence in this absolutely stunning film.</p><p>In the film’s big set piece, the apes, led by the movie’s villain Koba, go to war with the remaining humans in San Francisco. If you’ve ever seen a scene of an ape on horseback wielding two assault rifles akimbo-style, this is the genesis of that image. However, the most arresting part of this sequence is when Koba leads the charge on a tank. He jumps on top, kills the human gunner, and then dives into the tank to take out the rest of its crew. All the while, the camera is fixed to the spinning turret, panning over the warzone in a 360 degree shot that captures the chaos that Koba’s bloodlust has caused. Mortars come down, killing countless apes, but still they persist. Eventually, Koba reemerges the clear victor, seizes the turret and becomes the very thing he believes he’s fighting against: a tyrant, a man. <strong>— Moises Tavares</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Putting two movies in one entry is not cheating if those movies are meant to be watched in a single sitting, and I firmly believe Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic is a back-to-backer. <em>Dune: Part One </em>and <em>Part Two</em> take on what is largely considered the headiest, most difficult-to-adapt science fiction universe: Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em>. One director (Alejandro Jodorowsky) tried and failed to turn the ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s  science fiction novels into a science fiction film (though the legacy of that failed film can be found in <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Alien</em>, and beyond), while another (David Lynch) successfully made one that he pretty much openly hates. </p><p>But Villeneuve manages to succeed where other men failed, bringing Herbert’s heady first novel to the big screen with scale, splendor, and style. Though I’d argue there is more visual deliciousness in <em>Part Two</em> (like spacesuit-clad figures silently floating up off of the sands of Arrakis to mount an attack, or every single black-and-white scene set on Giedi Prime, planet whose sun blanches color from everything), <em>Part One </em>effectively sets the stage for the creation of a Messiah—the stranger in a strange land, the othering, the evil machinations of those determined to tear down a good man. There is so much more I could say about <em>Dune </em>(the incredible performances from its star-studded cast, the insanely cool set design, the costumes that I have daydreams about), but the simplest thing to say is: it fucking slaps. — <strong>Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p>Sci-fi often is often simply just the coolest shit imaginable, and <em>Edge of Tomorrow </em>is just that. This remarkable action movie is led by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, who star as soldiers in a war against aliens called Mimics, which are capable of looping time. Cruise, in an atypical move, is a hapless soldier who barely knows up from down, let alone how to use his exosuit, and relies on Blunt’s character, an esteemed war vet, to learn how to survive. In turn, as one of the only people aware of the time loop occurring every time he dies, Cruise tries to save everyone from being slaughtered by the Mimics.<br></p><p><em>Edge of Tomorrow </em>has been likened a lot over the years to video games. When Cruise’s character dies, he effectively respawns with all the knowledge of his past life. Taken as a whole, <em>Edge of Tomorrow </em>is just kind of a cool sci-fi roguelike. It’s also hilarious—watching the main character consistently eat shit as he tries to crystallize a sound strategy against the aliens leads to a few hearty belly laughs. If you want a crowd-pleasing flick, you cannot go wrong with <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, which should also just be turned into a video game at this point. <strong>— Moises Tavares</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Yet another Carpenter classic, <em>Escape From New York</em> is set in the near-future of 1997 where New York City has become one large maximum security prison—AKA a manifestation (and skewering) of the worst fears of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory#:~:text=In%20criminology%2C%20the%20broken%20windows,and%20disorder%2C%20including%20serious%20crimes.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory#:~:text=In%20criminology%2C%20the%20broken%20windows,and%20disorder%2C%20including%20serious%20crimes." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘80s broken windows policing</a></span>. Kurt Russell stars as the amazingly named Snake Plissken (the inspiration behind <em>Metal Gear</em>’s Solid Snake), who is about to be sentenced to prison on Manhattan Island for robbing the Federal Reserve, until the president is kidnapped by terrorists. Plissken is then injected with micro-explosives and dropped onto the island to search for and rescue the president, giving us an hour-and-a-half of gruff, no-nonsense Russell and one of the more grimy takes on Manhattan to come out of the ‘80s (and that’s saying something). </p><p><em>Escape From New York</em> has the mark of Carpenter all over it—the B-movie energy, the tongue-in-cheek observations on modern society, the wild action and weirdness. It’s an instant classic (and a great Halloween costume, I might add).  — <strong>Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p>You may have noticed by now that I’m a sucker for romance movies, and ones that blend them with sci-fi elements tend to be near the top of that list. I believe <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> was my first run-in to that hybrid genre, and to this day, it’s probably still one of the most effective. Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, everything’s great until it’s not, boy and girl fall apart. In <em>Eternal Sunshine</em>, there’s another step though: boy erases girl from memories via experimental new technology in order to rid himself of the pain of reliving that loss all the time.<br></p><p>Except there are some twists. <em>Eternal Sunshine </em>mostly takes place in Joel’s (Jim Carrey) memories as they are being erased. In a non-linear order, we bounce around his head and the highs and lows of his relationship with Clem, played by the always-astounding Kate Winslet. As his brain is getting toyed with and manipulated, the film adopts a visual style to match the events of the movie. This means there are abrupt cuts, visual noise and fog in certain scenes, and <em>Eternal Sunshine </em>finds fun in playing with perspective too. There’s at least one horrifying jumpscare (you’ll know it when you see it) but my favorite sequence involves the romantic leads speaking plainly to each other as the house around them (and Joel’s memory of their relationship) collapses. <em>Eternal Sunshine </em>has it all and then some. <strong>— Moises Tavares</strong></p></div><div><p>The multiverse has become such a bastardized science fiction concept thanks to cameo-filled franchise films that it’s easy to forget it’s an incredibly effective storytelling tool. <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once </em>follows the multiverse-spanning story of mother and daughter Evelyn and Joy. What starts as a mundane drama about generational divides through the lens of the Asian-American identity quickly escalates into an absurdist tale examining all that mundanity through an extremely distorted lens. </p><p><em>Everything Everywhere All At Once </em>unravels its two leads into every conceivable version of themselves across every timeline. Then all that’s left are two women who see every possibility they missed out on and choose to forsake all those other timelines to love each other in this one. Even with its exaggerated science fiction framing, <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once </em>captures the core truth that our relationships with each other give us reason to hope, to care, and to believe that this life is worth living, no matter how dull it may seem. The Daniels’ spin on the multiverse gazes into so many possibilities, but in every timeline, it finds that same deceptively simple truth. <strong>— Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>The events of <em>Ex Machina</em> could happen very soon, and that’s part of the reason why this Alex Garland flick is such an effective use of science fiction. It follows Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a programmer at an SEO company who wins a chance to spend a week with the company’s eccentric and elusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). When he arrives at the incredibly remote compound, he learns that he’s there to help Bateman determine if his incredibly advanced AI companion named Ava (Alicia Vikander) is capable of real human consciousness, and if Caleb can relate to her despite the nature of her creation.</p><p>But <em>Ex Machina</em> quickly transitions into a thriller—Bateman is erratic and seemingly cruel to his creations, and Ava wants Caleb’s help in escaping the compound. The two seem to fall in love, pushing the boundaries of what AI is capable of, just for us to learn that Ava goes even further beyond those boundaries. The film’s twists are delicious, Vikander is a vision, the android girl power on display gave me the kind of unbridled confidence only a white man knows, and, of course, we got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7C69HqnV8s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7C69HqnV8s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this absolutely bonkers scene from Isaac</a></span> that will forever be seared in my memory. — <strong>Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p><em> The Fifth Element</em> is the kind of wacky, sexy, but totally sincere science fiction movie that we don’t really get anymore. The European sci-fi action film about magic space rocks and an evil fireball set to destroy Earth stars Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Chris Tucker, and Gary Oldman, and it’s so damn fun and memorable. If you like interesting and eye-catching sets and costume designs, this movie has you covered. If you love strange sci-fi nonsense and weird aliens, this movie has that in spades. Or maybe you just want some sexy people doing cool action sequences while an alien lady sings electronic opera. Well,<em> Fifth Element</em> has that too, and all of it is wonderful. </p><p>There’s not a dull moment or boring scene in this film. It’s the kind of sci-fi that offers just enough world-building and lore around its edges to make tantalize you, but never gets bogged down in any of its universe-building. It zips from beginning to end and along the way features lines and moments I still quote to this day. We need more sci-fi that’s not afraid to be strange, horny, and cool. But for now, I’ll just watch <em>The Fifth Element </em>again.— <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>It’s yucky, it’s gross, it stays with you long after the film ends, it’s <em>The Fly</em>. It’s also a David Cronenberg film so of course you’d expect icky body horror galore. The 1986 movie stars Jeff Goldblum as Seth Brundle, a brilliant but bizarre scientist determined to figure out how to harness the power of teleportation. Despite the pods successfully teleporting inanimate objects, they warp and mutilate anything alive, but that doesn’t stop our Sethy, oh no. He goes in the teleportation pods himself, and well, you know the title of the film. <em>The Fly</em> boasts incredibly gross and effective practical effects, the kind you’d expect from a Cronenberg film, as well as fleshed-out characters that ensure the disgusting shit you’re seeing also hurts to watch. An absolute classic. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p> Can a parody of a franchise become one of the best entries in said franchise? I think so and <em>Galaxy Quest</em>, a big-budget send-up of <em>Star Trek</em>, is a perfect example. The 1999 film features Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Alan Rickman as aging actors who were once part of a <em>Star Trek</em>-like TV show but who now are slumming it at conventions. However, they get involved in a real-life space war when a group of aliens who don’t understand fiction mistake their series for reality and teleport them into a recreation of the fake ship to help them fight an evil alien empire. </p><p>What makes <em>Galaxy Quest</em> work is that the people behind it clearly love <em>Star Trek</em>, so the jokes in the movie never feel mean or shitty. It feels like <em>Star Trek</em> fans cracking wise about red shirts and aliens all looking like humans. It also helps that <em>Galaxy Quest</em> isn’t justreally funny and respectful of <em>Star Trek,</em> but it’s also a genuinely great sci-fi film that even non-Trekkies will enjoy. But if you do love <em>Star Trek</em>, you’ll get a kick out of <em>Galaxy Quest</em>’s antics and feel a bit of pride in the movie’s final act, which involves a diehard nerd saving the day through his knowledge of lore and canon. Truly, every superfan’s dream. <strong>— Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Oh no, don’t be an AI assistant with a sensual voice, you’re so sexy and I’m in love with you! <em>Her</em>, starring Joaquin Phoenix and the disembodied voice of Scarlett Johansson, is a lovely genre mashup of sci-fi and romance. Though in the current cultural climate there is a slightly less adorable sheen on the story of a lonely man falling in love with his AI assistant, <em>Her</em> still has the power to make you laugh, cry, and worry about the inevitable takeover of the world by robot overlords. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p>I don’t think you can find a better adaptation of a young adult novel than <em>The Hunger Games</em> trilogy—and I’d argue that a very good YA adaptation of a science fiction series is worth a spot on this list. In the aughts/teens, there was a slew of movies adapted from YA fantasy and sci-fi novels (<em>Twilight</em>, <em>The Maze Runner</em>, <em>Divergent</em>, <em>The Mortal Instruments</em>), but the only one that gave us consistently great acting and heart-wrenching scenes was <em>The Hunger Games</em>. Jennifer Lawrence slips so well into the role of Katniss Everdeen that it’s impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, and her incredible capabilities as an actor help drive home just truly terrible this dystopic world is. </p><p>The mix of absurd spectacle and dreary daily life for Panem’s lower-class people makes for a riveting watch, and one that feels even more prescient and poignant today. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p>Very few movies on this list made me cry quite like <em>Interstellar</em>. Christopher Nolan’s time-bending sci-fi flick follows the story of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot turned farmer after a global blight careens the human race toward extinction and space travel is deemed frivolous. When Cooper and his two children discover strange patterns in falling dust particles, they decipher the binary code and trace it to a secret NASA facility that has been toiling away at figuring out how to transport humanity to other hospitable planets. Cooper agrees to man the flight, but faces immense odds, including time dilation (an hour spent on one potential planet is seven years on Earth), a mad scientist determined to get back home no matter the cost, and the consequences of leaving your young children behind to embark on what very may well be a fruitless endeavor. </p><p>Though <em>Interstellar</em> plays with some pretty involved scientific conceits, at its core it’s a story about the power of love and its ability to transcend time. An absolute fucking tear jerker that’s brilliantly paced and well-acted by McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p>There are few movies more emblematic of ‘90s cinema’s heyday than <em>Jurassic Park</em>. Based on the novel by Michael Crichton, the film explores the possibilities of bringing dinosaurs back from the dead, and what happens when you try to harness the power of nature for financial gain—it’s a park, after all, meant for the amusement of attendees, not so much the preservation of long-extinct species. What happens when God creates dinosaurs, kills dinosaurs, then creates man—and man chooses to create dinosaurs? (“Dinosaurs eat man, woman inherits the earth,” of course.)</p><p><em>Jurassic Park</em> melds practical effects with what was then state-of-the-art CG to impressive results that still hold up today. The velociraptor’s breath fogging up a glass window, the T-rex chewing on a car tire, the sickly stegosaurus being tended to by the lovely, captivating Laura Dern, are all visuals seared into the brains of anyone who’s seen <em>Jurassic Park</em>.</p><p>Perfectly paced, well-acted, and shot with an eye that only Steven Spielberg has, <em>Jurassic Park </em>endures, always. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong> </p></div><div><p>I recently rewatched <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> ahead of <em>Furiosa</em> (which you should absolutely see), and was viscerally reminded of just how damn good it is. Though the notion that good art can only be made through suffering is one I don’t subscribe to, <em>Fury Road </em>is arguably a point in its favor—production was plagued with problems, from having to relocate the entire shoot from Australia to Africa, to an alleged feud between stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, to the grueling nature of filming in a desert. But the results are absolutely incredible, a testament to George Miller’s singular vision and the power of a great casting department. </p><p>Visually, <em>Fury Road</em> looks like nothing that came before it and almost nothing since (save for <em>Furiosa</em>), with Miller finally having the tools at his disposal to create a masterpiece. Erratic and rapid zoom-ins, blue-black desert nights, searingly bright sands, the ethereal, almost magical beauty of Immortan Joe’s wives, scantily clad in diaphanous white fabric—<em>Fury Road</em> feels like a masculine movie with a feminine heart. It will get your heart pounding in one moment and tear it out in the next. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div><div><p>First off, <em>Minority Report </em>is fun as hell, a man-on-the-run story that belongs alongside <em>The Fugitive </em>as a terrific example of a yarn about an innocent person caught up in the wheels of a justice system gone awry (or perhaps one that’s just fundamentally fucked from top to bottom) and who will do anything to extricate himself and prove his innocence. Tom Cruise does <em>so much </em>running here, y’all! And like many of the movies collected here, <em>Minority Report </em>is a masterpiece of visual cohesion and worldbuilding, creating a technological future so rich with detail that it feels like it would stretch on if you picked a direction and kept on walking. (In fact, in writing this entry I just discovered that there’s a whole Wikipedia page devoted to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologies_in_Minority_Report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologies_in_Minority_Report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technologies in <em>Minority Report</em></a></span>” which explores how the film features “numerous fictional future technologies which have proven prescient.”)<br></p><p>And yet, as much as sites love to write lists covering all the things a given movie “got right” or “got wrong,” it’s not sci fi’s role to accurately predict the future; it’s to tell stories that explore the human condition in compelling ways that other genres often can’t, and <em>Minority Report </em>is one of the best of the 21st century in that regard. One of three films on this list adapted from the work of Philip K. Dick (the others being <em>Blade Runner </em>and <em>Total Recall</em>), Spielberg’s breathless sci-fi thriller shares with those its propensity to make us think deeply about how we experience fundamental elements of life. It also has an amazing, star-making performance from a young Colin Farrell, one of <em>Minority Report</em>’s most impressive special effects. <strong>— Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Hot on the heels of 1986’s <em>Aliens</em>, John McTiernan’s <em>Predator </em>again gave us a bunch of badasses who find themselves being slaughtered by a nigh-unstoppable alien threat, albeit in a scenario that takes place much closer to home. McTiernan lays on the intoxicating atmosphere wonderfully thick; I can practically feel the sweltering heat in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VD-fBj4d9Ck?si=jA7spWYe1gsWmg9D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VD-fBj4d9Ck?si=jA7spWYe1gsWmg9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that early scene</a></span> that gave us the most memeified handclasp of all time. <em>Predator </em>also sees Schwarzenegger really coming into his own as an action hero. I won’t say he gives a rich, nuanced performance, but he’s clearly learning how to leverage his charisma and screen presence to great effect. </p><p>Like <em>Aliens</em>, however, this is an ensemble film, elevated tremendously by the variety of personalities that Schwarzenegger’s Alan “Dutch” Schaefer has at his command. It’s a wonderfully quotable popcorn flick, too, giving us lines like Jesse Ventura’s classic, “I ain’t got time to bleed.” Many viewers, however, misread this moment, and the film as a whole, as an uncritical, uncomplicated celebration of alpha male bravado, never mind that the heroes find themselves slaughtered one by one. But consider how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/58UIi57rEFo?si=c6o2TYcJdJ_SeIGk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/58UIi57rEFo?si=c6o2TYcJdJ_SeIGk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ventura’s line is followed up by another</a></span>, as Richard Chavez’s Poncho replies with a skeptical but resigned, “oh, okay.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bloodknife.com/predator-drug-war-folly-of-empire/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bloodknife.com/predator-drug-war-folly-of-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Predator </em>gives us more than just a superficial creature feature</a></span>, though it certainly delivers on that level, with phenomenal creature design and special effects that, for the time, were state of the art. At every turn, it uses its high-concept tale of a trophy-hunting alien to nod to the futility and the terrible cost of American imperialism and overreach in ways that deepen the film’s richness without interfering with the fun.<strong>— Carolyn Petit </strong><br></p></div><div><p>Paul Verhoeven’s satirical sci-fi masterpiece, like many of the films on this list, is great for many reasons, not least of which because it works both as pure entertainment and as a film replete with meaning that rewards repeat viewings and deeper consideration. (If you want to dip your toe into just some of the lenses through which people have deeply considered this indelible film, check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop#Thematic_analysis&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop#Thematic_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the hefty “thematic analysis” section</a></span> of its Wikipedia entry.) <em>RoboCop </em>gives us an absolutely iconic hero, exceptional on every level, from the visual design of his suit to the sound his footsteps make. It gives us eye-popping special effects (with terrific stop-motion animation charm), wonderfully over-the-top villains, and hilarious situations, like the scene in which a corporate stooge is gunned down by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/TYsulVXpgYg?si=Tg6wA6tZ47gjX7wa&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/TYsulVXpgYg?si=Tg6wA6tZ47gjX7wa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a “malfunctioning” ED-209</a></span> that presents violence with all the glee of a <em>Looney Tunes </em>cartoon.<br></p><p>And yet somehow, despite (or perhaps because of) the ludicrousness of so much of <em>RoboCop</em>, it maintains a beating human heart. Consider the scene in which Murphy, the severely wounded (declared dead) cop who remains haunted by his humanity after being crudely repurposed by the vile OCP, gets help from his partner Lewis to recalibrate his targeting computer by shooting little bottles of baby food, how much it speaks to everything Murphy has lost. Like its hero, <em>RoboCop </em>has a lot more going on under the hood than many suspect. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Director M. Night Shyamalan developed a reputation early on for making films with surprising twists that recontextualized everything that came before, but what makes <em>Signs </em>so effective as a sci-fi horror film is that there’s a twist of sorts baked into the very concept, and into Shyamalan’s filmmaking. Rather than using tight, enclosed spaces to build up suspense the way many sci-fi horror films do, in <em>Signs</em>, for much of its runtime at least, it’s the vastness of the spaces its characters inhabit that often feel threatening, the feeling that there is no safety to be found out in its endless Pennsylvania cornfields. Shyamalan may be the very definition of a hit-or-miss filmmaker, but in <em>Signs </em>his desire to always deliver something fresh and inventive to viewers and to do something he hasn’t done before paid off with this unique horror film that ensured I’ll never look at all that beautiful scenery rolling by out the window on a road trip quite the same way again.<strong>— Carolyn Petit </strong></p></div><div><p>A common theme in sci-fi is urgency—the genre often speculates on the urgent problems of the far-flung and near future to try and instill a sense of caution in the choices of today. At the same time that I was becoming a more politically aware young adult, I started absorbing an influx of smart sci-fi stories about climate change, the crisis that will claim all of us in a matter of decades and that has single-handedly made this past summer the hottest and most insufferable season of my life. <em>Snowpiercer</em>, from Bong Joon Ho (<em>Parasite</em>) is one such story.</p><p><em>Snowpiercer </em>is a class-conscious thriller about a rebellion on board a globe-spanning train carrying the last vestiges of humanity after Earth has effectively frozen over, becoming completely inhospitable. At the tail end of the trains are the working class, who slave away in the train’s squalid makeshift ghettos while the unimaginably wealthy upper class sit in their fancy cars at the front of the train dining like fat cats and pretending nothing is amiss. It isn’t the most high-brow sci-fi concept, nor is it especially showy in the way that the genre tends to be, and that’s why I love it. <em>Snowpiercer </em>is a grisly and down-to-earth tale of of a future I can picture with relative ease, one where the world has fallen into a state of disrepair and rather than cast aside the harmful attitudes we’ve spent generations learning and reinforcing, we double down and doom ourselves to oblivion. <strong>— Moises Tavares</strong><br></p></div><div><p>It’s hard to realize today, in 2024, just how huge the original <em>Star Wars</em> film was and how it completely changed sci-fi forever. So much of the science fiction we see now is directly inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> or other projects that were inspired by the original 1977 film. The original movie presented a rusty, lived-in, and beat-up universe filled with broken robots and old bases. It’s main hero wasn’t a suave, chiseled man clad in a silver suit who punched people and always knew what to do. Instead, Luke is a young farm boy, lost, looking for guidance, and unaware of his power and future. </p><p>And if you only watch <em>A New Hope</em>, you’ll be treated to a completely self-contained story of that young man meeting a scoundrel, saving a princess, leading a scrappy rebellion against an evil empire’s big weapon, and stopping the bad guys before they can kill more people. Sure, there are many more movies after this, but you don’t need to watch them to enjoy <em>A New Hope. </em><strong>— Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>We can debate forever about which <em>Star Wars </em>films are good and which are bad, but regardless of the endless loops those conversations can mire us in, I think it’s clear <em>The Empire Strikes Back </em>revealed that this galaxy far, far away was worth revisiting, that its tales could be the stuff of both grounded, human intimacy and epic mythmaking. Here, the fairly shallow archetypal characters introduced in the original <em>Star Wars </em>(or, if you must, <em>A New Hope</em>) become far more defined and real. It may be the “slowest” entry in the original trilogy but to me this is its greatest asset, as it’s in its most lowkey moments that we really see the bonds these characters have forged. </p><p>It’s the fact that we get this time to grow attached to them as people who do things like navigate romantic longing or risk it all for a friend (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Ps8cqX6-ZuM?si=IQdhiF3ndhLahCP3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Ps8cqX6-ZuM?si=IQdhiF3ndhLahCP3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then I’ll see you in hell!</a></span>”) that makes it so painful when they find themselves betrayed in the end, that makes Han Solo’s “I know” one of the all-time great movie lines, that makes Vader’s revelation of Luke’s identity so shattering. Its ambiguous ending, which finds our heroes in dire straits and staring down an uncertain future, is deliciously bold for a major franchise film, and the visual design of that climactic lightsaber battle in the carbonite facility on Cloud City is second to none. Okay, I’ll say it: <em>Star Wars </em>doesn’t get any better than this. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p><em>Starship Troopers </em>is a cult classic sci-fi satire flick that lambasts the military industrial complex, nationalism, and humanity in general. In the 23rd century, Earth is ruled by a singular force: the United Citizen Federation, a regime of which you can only become a fully fledged citizen (and be able to vote or have children) if you serve. Humans are colonizing the galaxy, but in their quest for galactic domination, they encounter highly intelligent insectoid aliens they call “bugs.” </p><p>The ensuing war is full of gory deaths and absurd patriotism. Yes, this film heavily influenced <em>Helldivers</em>, and yes, many people miss the point of it, but you can’t deny the hilariously dark and twisted power that is <em>Starship Troopers—</em>even if it bombed at the box office. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p>Misunderstood and maligned upon its 1995 release, it’s been gratifying in recent years to see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692">Kathryn Bigelow’s <em>Strange Days </em>find the fans</a></span> it so richly deserves. An audacious, go-for-broke film, <em>Strange Days </em>has a fascinating sci-fi concept (people relive the recorded memories of others as illicit entertainment), amazing performances from an exceptional cast, and a healthy hatred of cops. The film is a direct influence on more recent cyberpunk media including <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>(compare this film’s opening scene with that game’s braindance tutorial, an obvious homage), but it also feels like a true original, something uniquely its own. Much of <em>Strange Days </em>is bleak and depressing, but I think it only probes the darkness in order to find a realistic basis for hope, which it finds, beautifully, in its transcendent final moments. Watch on New Year’s Eve for maximum effect.<strong> – Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p>With a stellar ensemble cast (Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Mark Strong, and Hiroyuki Sanada) and a proven director (Danny Boyle), <em>Sunshine is</em> well-deserving of a spot on this list. It follows the story of the Icarus II, a spaceship on a mission to drop a nuke into the sun in order to “re-ignite” it as it’s dying several billion years too soon. <em>Sunshine</em>’s scientific merit has long been a point of contention, but they call it science <em>fiction</em> for a reason guys, so sue me if I don’t want to think about the inevitable heat death of the universe and just want to stare at Cillian Murphy’s pretty eyes. </p><p>But <em>Sunshine</em> offers so much more bizarre beauty beyond Murphy’s baby blues—a gorgeous, awe-inspiring scene of the Icarus II crew seeing Mercury for the first time, the eerie vision of the sun’s terrifying power, sweat beading on a brow as they work on the ship in the vicinity of the sun. The sci-fi thriller will dazzle you in one moment and worry you the next, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. It’s not perfect, but <em>Sunshine </em>does what all good sci-fi should do: inspires you to wonder, to worry, to ask questions about the nature of the universe and man within it. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Christopher Nolan’s best film is not <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Dunkirk</em>, <em>or </em>even <em>Oppenheimer</em>—it’s<em>&nbsp;</em>2020’s <em>Tenet</em>. That might sound absolutely bonkers if you’ve never seem the director’s time-bending action masterpiece, but it is the truth. In an early scene, a character literally tells John David Washington, who plays a character known only as The Protagonist, “Don’t try to understand.” That goes for the audience as well. If you try to wrap your head around the logic of inverted entropy and bullets moving backwards through time then you will make your brain hurt, but if you just watch a 747 get blown to hell both forward and backwards, you’re in for a great ride.<br></p><p>Still, even with a somewhat nonsensical premise, everything Nolan excels as a director is present in <em>Tenet</em>. The action set pieces are unparalleled and almost entirely practical, and they’re connected by solid performances from the cast. Washington is exceedingly charismatic as The Protagonist and gets a solid co-star in Robert Pattinson. The script is minimal thanks to how much the action speaks for the characters but every line packs a punch.  There is even a thematic throughline about the horrors of war and humanity’s obsession with destroying ourselves—we even get an Oppenheimer name drop. <em>Tenet </em>is a film made by a director at the peak of his career, a gorgeously shot and excellently acted flourish of cinematic mastery that refuses to be anything but original. <strong>— Willa Rowe</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Given what a lavish, expensive production its sequel was, it can be surprising to go back to the original <em>Terminator </em>and remember that this was a pretty low-budget affair, a somewhat grungy film that nonetheless thrillingly captured director James Cameron’s capacity for visual flair. In fact, I love that grungy quality, and for my money <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/x3hGMgd2X14?si=iKowFR9s-9Nsua2S&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/x3hGMgd2X14?si=iKowFR9s-9Nsua2S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the club scene in this original film</a></span> remains the most cinematically exciting sequence in the franchise. The moment when Arnold walks by Sarah’s table in slow motion just as she’s out of sight, the glimpse of Reese (who Sarah still thinks may be the killer stalking her) in the mirror, it’s all so purely visual and effective, cinema at its most stripped down and elemental. And man, what an effective use of Arnold. Robert Patrick’s T-1000 in the sequel is incredible, don’t get me wrong, but nothing beats the way Arnold’s physique, accompanied by that ruthless, calculating gaze, fills the frame, the way he moves not like a man but like a thing compelled. Terrifying and unforgettable.<strong> – Carolyn Petit </strong></p></div><div><p>A towering entry in the action genre, <em>Terminator 2 </em>has so many sequences—the truck chase down the L.A. River, the Cyberdyne building infiltration, the climactic steel mill face-off—that viewers will never forget. Its most brilliant element, however, might be James Cameron’s decision to have the same actor who played the first film’s terrifying, relentless hunter become this film’s beleaguered savior, pit against a villain even more formidable and terrifying than himself. Made when the limits of CGI in cinema were still constantly being tested and pushed, Cameron used those limits to his advantage, giving the T-1000 the kind of silvery shine and formlessness that top-of-the-line effects of the time could believably handle. In the hands of a perfectly cast Robert Patrick, the T-1000 invokes a very different kind of fear than the first film’s T-800 did, all smooth confidence (“Say, that’s a nice bike”) and abuse of power. </p><p><br>And this was by design. As Cameron said in an interview for the 2010 book <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Futurist-Life-Films-James-Cameron-ebook/dp/B0034184U0?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/best-sci-fi-movies-of-all-time-streaming-watch-rank-1851634001&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0034184U0" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>The Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron</em></a></span>, “The <em>Terminator</em> films are not really about the human race getting killed off by future machines. They’re about us losing touch with our own humanity and becoming machines, which allows us to kill and brutalize each other. Cops think of all non-cops as less than they are, stupid, weak, and evil. They dehumanize the people they are sworn to protect and desensitize themselves in order to do that job.” What makes this theme shine through all the stronger is the way that, contrasted with this profoundly inhuman machine in the guise of an authority figure who we expect to dehumanize others, we also see a machine learn to be more human, and the scene in which that machine must sacrifice itself for the sake of the future is genuinely moving. The world arguably grows more dehumanizing and desensitizing every day. Let this big, bombastic sci-fi action movie be a reminder: stay human. <strong>— Carolyn Petit</strong> </p></div><div><p>Ridley Scott’s adaptation of the novel of the same name could easily have been a bleak, harrowing look at the unforgiving nature of space. The film follows Matt Damon’s Dr. Mark Watney, who gets stranded on Mars and must survive long enough for NASA to stage a rescue. That premise may sound like the makings of a distressing thriller. Instead, <em>The Martian </em>is a rollicking, funny, and cheer-worthy depiction of people coming together for a common goal. It has its moments of despair, darkness, and high stakes, but I look back fondly on the 2015 film as a hopeful jaunt to the stars and back, carried by excellent performances from its stacked cast.<strong> — Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p><em>The Matrix</em>, the Wachowskis’ crown jewel, is a cultural touchstone in the science fiction genre. The opening sequence in which Keanu Reeves’ Neo chooses to question his reality and awaken from a simulation could be its own short film with plenty of symbolism and allegory to dissect and project onto. But the film continues to expand upon the ideas of liberation and ushering in a new era for humanity after it’s reckoned with its hero’s self-concept and society’s contentment to conform comfortably. <em>The Matrix </em>is the origin point of memetic concepts like choosing between two colored pills, action scenes like Neo leaning back to dodge bullets in slow motion that would go on to be referenced and parodied across media in the decades that followed. It is embedded in the culture of film, but also in the science fiction genre in a way few works can claim. <strong>— Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>1979’s <em>Mad Max </em>kicked off the franchise that, decades later, would give us <em>Fury Road</em>, but it was this 1981 sequel that elevated George Miller’s guzzoline-starved apocalypse to the stuff of myth. Called simply <em>Mad Max 2 </em>outside the U.S., this bigger and better sequel has some of the most indelible images in all of sci-fi filmmaking, really establishing that quintessentially <em>Mad Max</em> look that would influence so many visions of the post-apocalypse in the years that followed. Miller directs scenes of violence with wonderful energy, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/RAHOMuiipsE?si=kVH1DhpZLFgjw7Jf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/RAHOMuiipsE?si=kVH1DhpZLFgjw7Jf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this unforgettable scene</a></span> that has to have the greatest boomerang-related carnage ever in a movie, but he also knows when to slow down and deepen our connection to the characters, like in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LrFbfSBrfbs?si=CBOt72AsJRKCLZfT&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LrFbfSBrfbs?si=CBOt72AsJRKCLZfT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this simple but effective scene</a></span> in which Max and the “feral child” share a fleeting moment of something resembling human connection in the wasteland. And, of course, it all culminates in one hell of a car chase. “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/W3CUQvUvqac?si=hbo-rgw4JyCFgI8b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/W3CUQvUvqac?si=hbo-rgw4JyCFgI8b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’ll drive that tanker,</a></span>” indeed. –<strong> Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p>John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing</em> is one of those movies I force my friends, lovers, and family members to watch—because many of them, especially older people in my family, only know it as the 1982 film that was critically panned for what <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-thing-1982&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-thing-1982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">critics said</a></span> was an over-reliance on gore and shallow characters. Nowadays <em>The Thing</em>, which follows a group of men living on a remote Antarctic outpost after encountering the “Thing,” an alien life form that subsumes and then becomes other organisms, is considered one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, and rightfully so. </p><p>Carpenter’s effective establishment of place—an icy, remote outpost and its cold, industrial interiors—makes you feel as alone as the researchers, and the incredible yucky and tactical practical effects are still effective today. Then, of course, it’s led by two of the most iconic actors of the time: Kurt Russell and Keith David, who turn out stellar performances as two men unsure of who to trust, as any one of them could be the Thing. An absolute masterclass in sci-fi horror filmmaking, from perhaps the best to ever do it.<strong> — Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Before The Rock and John Cena made the jump from the wrestling ring to the big screen, there was Rowdy Roddy Piper. John Carpenter, a huge wrestling fan, had seen the heel perform at <em>Wrestlemania III</em> and was enraptured by his uneven gait and his physical presence, and thus a silver screen star was born. It was a match made in heaven: in <em>They Live</em>, Piper plays a drifter known only as Nada who’s made his way to LA looking for work. He discovers a pair of Ray-Bans that, when worn, let him see the true nature of the world: a near-constant barrage of consumerism peddled by scary aliens who have been controlling us for years. Keith David also stars and, along with Piper, gives us one of the most batshit crazy fight scenes ever filmed for a movie—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9rrgJXfLns&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9rrgJXfLns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than five minutes of the two beating the piss out of each other</a></span>. </p><p><em>They Live </em>is a hilariously scathing take on consumerism and hypermasculine ‘80s action movies that only Carpenter could pull off with such a deft hand. <strong> — Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div><div><p>Paul Verhoeven followed up <em>RoboCop </em>with this equally inventive sci-fi film, cementing himself as one of the most exciting directors in the genre at that point in time. <em>Total Recall </em>delivered all the action an Arnie fan could hope for, wrapped in some mindblowing questions of the sort that sci-fi is so great at posing. How well do we really know ourselves? How much do our memories matter? Does it matter if what we experience is real? “That’s a new one, blue skies on Mars” seems like a throwaway line when uttered by an attendant at Rekall, the memory implant service Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) visits in the film, but it winds up being a reason for us to question everything that follows, a twisty, identity-bending odyssey that sees Quaid going to Mars and killing the corporate tyrant who has the planet in his grasp. </p><p>That’s all great, but what really makes the film exceptional is how fully realized the film’s vision of Mars is, packed with the kinds of unforgettable little details that suggest the production designers and filmmakers really thought through what Mars was like as a place. The fact that it all thrums with that signature, biting Verhoeven satire makes it endlessly enjoyable, and that stuff—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/eAkeZqAN_qU?si=7lcpHT69vKE6lG9L&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/eAkeZqAN_qU?si=7lcpHT69vKE6lG9L" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this scene in which Quaid must deal with an obnoxiously chipper, entirely useless taxi-driving robot</a></span>—only feels more relevant as we find machines increasingly doing the work once done by people in ways that only make our lives worse. Oh, and if you think you remember a remake of this film starring Colin Farrell from 2012, you don’t. That was just a false memory we were all implanted with. <strong>—Carolyn Petit</strong> </p></div><div><p>Jonathan Glazer’s very loose adaptation of the novel by Michel Faber is one of the most haunting science fiction films ever made. It’s also a film that defies appreciation-by-blurb, demanding closer attention and deeper exploration of what it’s doing than I have the time or space for here. In short, it stars Scarlett Johansson as an alien who assumes the appearance of a human woman and seduces men, luring them back to a place where they meet their demise in the most stunning and unsettling way imaginable. </p><p>Very short on dialogue, the film never explains what the larger purpose is behind these seductions, but through the visual language it cultivates, we see the protagonist develop a kind of connection with this species she’s come here to harvest. All too soon, as the skin she’s wearing makes her, for all appearances, a human woman, she finds herself suffering as so many human women do. It’s a profound exploration of the nature of identity, and of what it is to inhabit a body and all the baggage that comes with it. One of the best films of the 2010s in any genre, <em>Under the Skin </em>is another masterpiece from the maker of <em>Birth </em>and <em>The Zone of Interest</em>. <strong>– Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p>Though Tom Cruise is mostly known for his starring roles in action flicks these days, I think his best movie is easily the sci-fi drama <em>Vanilla Sky</em>. The thing is that I cannot give away exactly why it <em>is </em>such a moving sci-fi movie without spoiling tons of it. I can at least set you up though: Cruise plays David Aames, a typical New York socialite playboy whose life comes together and falls apart as two major events happen, his meeting with Sofia (Penélope Cruz) and a car accident that disfigures his face and sense of self. As he reels from the impact of both, David begins to question himself and the reality around him. </p><p><em>Vanilla Sky </em>is deeply sentimental and low-fi by all measures, which are not typical merits of what folks might deem the absolute best sci-fi movies, but I think the way that it manages to wrap up its psychological thriller trappings in the larger genre <em>work</em>. It also gave us one of the best movie soundtracks of all time and introduced me to one of my favorite songs, Spiritualized’s “Ladies And Gentlemen, We Are Floating In Space.” But ultimately, I think it just uses sci-fi to tell a story anyone can relate to: how do you deal with the loss of the love of your life? <strong>— Moises Tavares</strong><br></p></div><div><p>It’s been 16 years since Pixar released its post-apocalyptic romance film and <em>WALL-E </em>feels more apt than ever. The movie’s titular little robot hero starts the movie wandering a desecrated Earth and trying to clean up the mess humanity left behind. Humans have completely abandoned the planet as it became uninhabitable for all the reasons environmentalists are still warning us about today. Corporate interests are prioritized over the health of the planet, and eventually, that will catch up to all of us who aren’t even benefiting from it in the short term. <em>WALL-E</em>’s space-faring robot romance is full of adorable moments and humorous takes on the apocalypse and is still gorgeous to look at nearly 20 years later, but perhaps what keeps it resonating after all this time is the knowledge </p><p>that we are still barreling toward its dystopian future. But at the center of its story is a hope that not all is lost, and that is a message that carries just as much weight. —<strong> Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>Some of the most fascinating science fiction comes out of collective cultural trauma. <em>Godzilla</em>, for instance, clearly emerged as a kind of fictional symbol of Japan’s experiences in World War II. Steven Spielberg’s <em>War of the Worlds</em>, meanwhile, is an explicitly post 9-11 film, and while the sight of imagery in movies that deliberately recalls the September 11 attacks may feel cliche all these years later, to see this movie in 2005 was to see the first mainstream work from a major filmmaker that was clearly trying to process the event and its lingering trauma. Spielberg frames the action masterfully (no surprise, of course), keeping us among the masses of terrified, struggling people, both so that we know that this struggle is a collective one, and so the alien threat remains larger than life.</p><p>I’m not sure if, as more time passes, the film’s power will grow, with people appreciating it more and more as a remarkable cultural artifact that offers insight, through the lens of art and fiction, into the psyche of a reeling nation, or if it will fade as the moment that shaped it gets ever further away and the film starts to seem obvious and clunky in its attempts to process something of such magnitude. I just know that it was remarkable to see this movie in a theater in 2005, to hear Dakota Fanning shriek, “Is it the terrorists?” when the aliens start attacking, to see people vaporized in an instant and know they were never coming back, to see Spielberg engage with how the real terror was the way that people, in their fear and desperation, could turn on each other. <em>War of the Worlds </em>is a rough, imperfect movie but I think perhaps a work like this should be rough and imperfect. There is no “perfect” way to process a tragedy through art, just as there’s no perfect way to move on from tragedy or carry it with us. Somehow, though, turning them into the stuff of movie monsters or extraterrestrial attacks always seems to help in some way. <strong>– Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-has-big-stealth-archer-potential<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>From the moment its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-avowed-rpg-announced-revealed-obsidian-fall-out-new-vegas-developer-games-showcase">cinematic announcement trailer</a> revealed that it would be played from a first-person perspective, Avowed has been viewed as Obsidian Entertainment’s answer to Skyrim. It’s a position <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-dev-once-again-asked-about-skyrim-comparison-points-to-the-outer-worlds">Obsidian itself has tried to distance itself from</a>, largely because Avowed is a smaller scale RPG made up of interconnected zones rather than a huge, sprawling open world game. Despite this, the Skyrim comparison makes a certain amount of sense; after proving it could do Bethesda games better than Bethesda itself with Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian created its own Fallout analogue in 2019’s The Outer Worlds. It cut short the agonising wait for Fallout 5 with a similar style of RPG (sure, it wasn’t open world, but it <em>was</em> directed by Fallout’s original creators), and so eyes have naturally turned to Avowed – could this be the game that finally gives us a new Elder Scrolls-like adventure years before Bethesda ships its own Skyrim successor? </p><p>At gamescom 2024 I was able to play an hour of Avowed. That’s hardly enough to say if it truly is capable of standing up to such a landmark RPG as Skyrim – I didn’t even get to explore outside of a single cave. However, what I did play suggested it may well equal (or, hopefully, actually <em>better</em>) Skyrim in one important area: the stealth archer build. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s a meme among the Skyrim community that everyone will eventually spec into a stealth archer build, no matter their initial intentions for a playthrough. That’s because playing a shadowy sniper in Skyrim is incredibly satisfying. You can decimate entire dungeons largely unseen and the thud of an arrow hitting an enemy’s skull is delightful every single time, particularly when it triggers a slow-motion killcam. I think Obsidian knows all this and has gone to lengths to ensure its own ranger class is equally strong.   </p><p>The gamescom demo’s example ranger build was, naturally, equipped with a bow. The fundamentals of it will be familiar to anyone who’s played not just Skyrim but any other game with archery – aim, zoom, draw back longer to increase power, and release. But as any stealth archer knows, the first shot is the most important – if it doesn’t hit true, if it doesn’t kill the target, then stealth is broken and chaos ensues. Seemingly recognising this, Avowed displays a small red diamond-shaped target on an enemy’s weak point when you zoom in, a feature likely pilfered from the similarly killing shot-obsessed Sniper Elite games. While I’m perfectly capable of aiming between the eyes without assistance, I actually don’t mind this – it’s like a HUD representation of your character’s archery prowess. They know exactly where to strike. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>After slipping into a parallel shadow realm, you’re able to walk right through enemy patrols without disturbing even the air molecules. </p></div><p>Archery is bolstered by two passive skills – power attacks and Steady Aim. Holding the drawn-back bow string engages the power attack, which empowers the notched arrow with a silver flame-like energy (I’m guessing this is because you play as a Godlike, a supernatural race from the Pillars of Eternity RPGs with which Avowed shares a setting with). Steady Aim, meanwhile, slows down time while aiming that power attack. These are, of course, repackaged versions of archery skills we’ve seen in Skyrim and beyond, but I’m glad they’re here because they’re a vital ingredient in the stealth archer’s return.     </p><p>Where Avowed’s sample archer build begins to deviate from Skyrim’s template is when it comes to sneaking. Naturally, you can crouch to reduce your visibility and crawl into long grass to disappear completely. But Avowed rangers also have access to the Shadowing Beyond skill, an active ability that renders you fully invisible until you make a combat action (provided you can afford its mana-draining cost.) It’s as effective as it sounds; after literally tearing a hole in reality and slipping into some kind of parallel shadow realm, you’re able to walk right through enemy patrols without disturbing even the air molecules. It’s the stealth archer’s dream, enabling you to bypass tricky encounters or reposition to a more advantageous sniper’s perch. It’s an ability that’s hard to come by in Skyrim; in Tamriel, a stealth archer needs to either find the Bow of Shadows and make use of its invisibility perk (which is nowhere near as powerful or flexible as Shadowing Beyond), or train as an illusionary mage in order to cast the invisibility spell. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/02/avowed-archer-1-1725271931755.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>When we talk about stealth archers, we mean rangers who can avoid this kind of firey scenario.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Maintaining silent stealth isn’t just for ranged encounters, though. I was pleased to see that Avowed has a proper stealth takedown attack; tap the attack trigger while looking at an unaware enemy and your character lunges forward, a spectral dagger-like weapon forming around their fist. The blade reduces the enemy’s body to shimmering ash, leaving no evidence of your kill for enemy guards to stumble across. It’s a very satisfying animation and an ability I’m sure will shape the direction of a stealth archer’s overall approach. </p><p>Of course, not every encounter is going to remain silent. For the occasions where things heat up, the ranger’s Tanglefoot spell allows you to summon thorny vines that root enemies to the spot for several seconds. It keeps them at a distance, letting you snipe them before they get into slashing range. I found this skill was also helpful when combined with other ranged options; the demo character’s backup weapon was a pair of flintlock pistols which are naturally louder and more explosive than a bow (plus can be fired twice in succession thanks to being dual-wielded), but they demand that enemies are kept far away thanks to their long reload times. Smart use of Tanglefoot, as well as directing my AI companion, Kai, to use his own abilities really helped here. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Avowed - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Talking of Kai, I was pleased to see that Avowed’s companions don’t seem to get in the way of your stealth tactics – something many of Skyrim’s clumsy companions are unforgivably guilty of. Kai never busted my cover and I think he even disappeared from view along with me when I used Shadowing Beyond. It’s things like this that make Avowed feel like a Skyrim-style game from the 2020s – the movement, the ability to mantle up to vantage points, the environmental hazards, the impact of combat, and the general polish all make Avowed feel like the kind of Elder Scrolls experience I want to have in the modern age. </p><p>I understand why Obsidian tries to push the conversation away from Skyrim when talking about Avowed – its zone-based environments likely will make the game structurally very different from The Elder Scrolls series. But there’s much more to Skyrim than its open world, and it’s those other elements that I think Obsidian can offer an excellent, updated analogue to. Hopefully, when we have the chance to explore beyond the demo’s cave and experience the grander scope of Avowed’s setting and story, it’ll also prove itself a well-designed, modern-feeling RPG in the important areas: character, level, and quest design. But for now I’m left feeling reasonably confident that Avowed will, at the very least, tickle the same bits of my brain that Skyrim did when I let loose a well-aimed arrow into a lizard man’s face. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yumia’s quest will take her across a ruined continent, and despite the uncertainties of confronting her past, she will need to create her own path if she hopes to unravel the mysteries behind the cataclysm that destroyed Aladiss. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> takes players on a journey exploring the theme of memory. Playing as Yumia Liessfeldt, a young alchemist who lost her mother in an accident when she was young, players set out to uncover the forbidden art of alchemy while also learning the true intentions of Yumia’s mother who hid her identity as an alchemist. Along the way, Yumia joins the Aladiss Research Team where she meets Vikto von Duerer and his younger sister, Isla von Duerer. There, they are also joined by an assorted cast of characters including a mysterious woman, a timid demi-human, and a former adventurer with spectacular experiences. </p><p>Together, Yumia and her companions will travel across the vast continent that was once the Aladissian Empire, where all civilization has perished. Players will have a wide range of actions and items at their disposal throughout the adventure, allowing them to explore a vast open world made up of different biomes as they make their way through these unknown lands gathering materials that can be used to synthesize and craft new items for use in their quest—both during exploration and combat. Not only will fans be able to craft items without having to return to their base thanks to the “Simple Synthesis” feature, but for the first time in the series, fans will be also able to build, furnish, and decorate their own base with the all-new “Building” feature! </p><p>To help make <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> come alive, Koei Tecmo and developer Gust have teamed up with the brilliant artist Benitama to create the main visual and all of the character designs. Specializing in creating illustrations and character designs for various fantasy game titles, Benitama incorporates references to paintings and reliefs in his work while striving to balance both persuasive depth and cuteness. His design, characterized by a monochrome based style, give a cool impression while bringing out the charm of the <em>Atelier</em> series. </p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Atelier-Yumia-The-Alchemist-of-Memories-and-the-Envisioned-Land_2024_09-02-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Weaving memories and tracing emotions.

            <p>
Rocksteady staff have told Eurogamer of redundancies at the studio, following the underperformance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The company's QA department has seen its size almost cut in half over the past month, Eurogamer understands, from 33 team members to 15, with poor sales of Suicide Squad directly cited as a reason for its "restructuring". 
</p>
<p>
The job losses extend outside of QA, too. One staff member posting publicly on social media over the weekend revealed they had been told they were being made redundant in the middle of their paternity leave. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Suicide Squad publisher Warner Bros. for comment, but has so far not received a response.

<p>
Rocksteady staff - who requested to remain anonymous - told Eurgamer that the loss of so many roles in the developer's QA department, including team members with specialised knowledge, would leave their remaining colleagues shouldered with more work. 
</p>
<p>
There has also been an acknowledgement by Rocksteady's senior management that product quality will now suffer as a result, staff say.
</p>
<p>
Staff members affected by the job cuts include numerous junior staff, but also several team members employed at Rocksteady for more than five years. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">Warner Bros. reported a 41 percent fall in gaming revenue year-on-year</a> due to the "weak performance" of Suicide Squad, after previously saying it had lost $200m on the game. Work continues on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-second-season-adds-frozone-esque-mrs-freeze">Suicide Squad's year of post-launch content</a>, though nothing has been said for what, if anything, will come next.
</p>
<p>
"Rocksteady's talent is so evident in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, it almost overcomes the terrible decision to try and make it," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Eurogamer's Suicide Squad review</a>.

Capcom is wisely seeking a different audience for its fantastic horror franchise, given the mobile machines are impressively capable of somewhat running the games. The issue is, no matter how often this has been tried over the years, there overlap on the Venn diagram for hardcore gamers and mobile players is razor-thin.<br></p><p>This is then exacerbated by the high prices for mobile games, with performance that’s not quite good enough, made far worse by touch controls being just the worst way to play such games. Hence <em>RE7</em> apparently only managing to sell a measly $28,000-worth according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a July 16 <em>MobileGamer.biz</em> report</a></span>. (<em>RE4</em> reportedly managed to convert 7,000 people to a full copy of the game, while <em>Village</em> managed a terrible 5,700 payments of $15.)</p><p>So responding to this lack of success by introducing a cumbersome internet requirement is bewildering. While we don’t know a motivation, it’s hard to imagine one other than a form of DRM—perhaps a misguided belief that <em>evil piracy</em> is to blame for no one wanting to play a game in the most inconvenient way possible. </p><p>But given most of the very small audience will be wanting to play these games on their iPads, and most of those people won’t have a SIM card in their iPad, you’ve just made playing the not-great game on the go a whole heap of tedium. Who is going to bother setting up a hotspot, or trying to find a passing wifi connection? And, like all forms of DRM, it will of course only affect the people who paid the full $20 for the game, and not anyone who might have found a way to less legally procure it. May as well play some more <em>Royal Kingdom</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
