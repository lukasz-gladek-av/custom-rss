The tabletop miniatures company known for producing beloved wargames is selling this miniature, based on their co-founder, in order to support brain tumor research.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://us.warlordgames.com/products/sergeant-sawyer-charity-figure?_pos=1&amp;_sid=c4b8c214d&amp;_ss=r">official store page</a>, the Sergeant Sawyer miniature is based on Warlord Games' co-founder Paul Sawyer. The miniature is equipped with a light machine gun, a red beret and a hearty salute. He stands ready to lead the British Airborne on their next daring mission, ready to dispense advice and hot lead as needed.</p>

He has recently stepped away from the company due to a serious illness. The miniature's British Airborne origin is in honor of Sawyer's fondness for painting Red Devils&nbsp; The miniature is unpainted metal with a 25 mm round plastic base.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Sawyer is our tribute to a man without whom Warlord Games would simply not exist, and our lives be far the poorer. Proudly bearing Paul’s smiling face, Sergeant Sawyer is an essential figure for every collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All proceeds from the sale of the Sergeant Sawyer miniature will go towards the <a href="https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/">Brain Tumour Charity</a>. This charity, chosen by Sawyer himself, is the world's leading brain tumor charity and the largest dedicated funder of brain tumor research globally.</p>

Every year they’ve got a new line of merch for every holiday and occasion. It’s a collector’s dream and their wallet’s nightmare. This year is no different, because The Pokémon Company has revealed some adorable plushies for its 2024 holiday line, and these little guys are so cute, it makes me want to decorate for the holidays before Halloween is even here.</p><p>The Holiday Poké Plush line includes a handful of the cutest, cuddliest little shits you’ve ever put in a Poké Ball and dresses them up in winter wear. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10060-101/pikachu-pokemon-holiday-plush-10-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10060-101/pikachu-pokemon-holiday-plush-10-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu</a></span> is the clear centerpiece with a light blue sweater with a shining Staryu smack dab in the middle, and a big Santa hat hanging off the side of his head. But the standout, in my opinion, is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10062-101/maushold-pokemon-holiday-plush-14-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10062-101/maushold-pokemon-holiday-plush-14-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maushold</a></span> plush. The Pokémon made up of a family of three or four mice could have given us each of the rodents separately with individual winter outfits, but The Pokémon Company knows how to commit to a bit, and Maushold’s whole schtick is that it’s treated as one Pokémon despite seemingly being multiple critters. So Maushold has a long scarf stretching around the entire family of mice and wrapping them together. And hey, the family of three is the same price as Pikachu, so that’s three plushies for the price of one.</p><p>While the bigger plushies are the draw, the Holiday line also includes smaller keychains that are just as adorable. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10058-101/dedenne-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10058-101/dedenne-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedenne</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10059-101/cubchoo-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10059-101/cubchoo-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cubchoo</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10057-101/espurr-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10057-101/espurr-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espurr</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10056-101/pawmi-snowman-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10056-101/pawmi-snowman-pokemon-holiday-plush-key-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pawmi</a></span> are each featured as part of the line, all dressed in winter clothes. Espurr sits in a stocking, but the Cubchoo keychain is probably my favorite. I’m a sucker for the snot-nosed little guy, and he looks so warm in his oversized scarf. Click through to see each of the plushies in the new line. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e94ce2f3d2a0862e9ec2e38a6bcfe5eb" data-recommend-id="image://e94ce2f3d2a0862e9ec2e38a6bcfe5eb"

<p>Team Quadrant, a UK-based esports organisation founded by Formula One driver Lando Norris, has announced a sudden withdrawal from the Halo Championship Series and, by extension, the esports industry in general. This news comes mere days after Quadrant finished in seventh place at the Halo World Championship in Seattle, Washington.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-quick-comedown">Quick Comedown</h2>



<p>In January 2024, Quadrant announced a massive seven-figure investment round and partnerships with some sizeable content creators. In 2023, the organisation was able to secure a streak of positive financial updates following strong collaborations and apparel sales, and it was soaring in the esports space.</p>



<p>That quickly soured, though.</p>



<p>On October 1, it was reported that Quadrant had ‘slumped into the red’ after reporting negative total equity in a company filing. Now, the organisation has reported a complete withdrawal from the esports industry to instead focus on creative content, fashion, and motorsport culture, leaning still on Lando Norris for brand recognition.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As of today, Quadrant announces that we are departing the Halo Championship Series and wider direct involvement in esports to continue with full focus on our exciting mission of being a brand rooted at the intersection of motorsport culture, fashion, and creative content.</p>



<p>We are deeply proud of whwat we have achieved during our time in esports and would like to share a special thank you to our HCS players, 343 Industries <em>(now Halo Studios)</em>, and Microsoft for theiur devotion and commitment to the game we love – we wish you the best moving forward.</p>



<p>To our fans, we thank you for your incredible and unwavering support. You have been a constant and passionate reminder of why we wntered into this space in the first place, and we hope we have given you as many memories as you have provided us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the second UK-based esports organisation to suffer on a financial front of late. Recently, Guild Esports, which is represented by David Beckham as a brand ambassador, was acquired in full by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guild-esports-acquired-by-dcb-sports-for-just-130000/">a US-based firm for just $130,000</a>.</p>



<p>In recent months, the UK has also withered in the gaming space as two of the region’s biggest gaming and esports events disappeared into nothing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is shuttering Firewalk Studios in the wake of its disastrous release of Concord, the PS5 shooter that lasted less than two weeks before being shuttered. The news was first reported by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firewalk Studios' closure follows the reported departure of director Ryan Ellis, who stepped down after Concord was taken offline. Sony Interactive Entertainment publicly posted the internal email from Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst with a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement on the closure</a>, which you can read below. Hulst wrote that SIE had "spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options," but ultimately decided to sunset the studio, which it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">had acquired in April 2023</a>. The email also announces SIE's decision to close Neon Koi, a German studio working on a mobile action game.</p><blockquote>Dear Team, </blockquote><blockquote>Today, I want to share some important updates from Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group.   </blockquote><blockquote>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.  </blockquote><blockquote>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams.  We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations.   </blockquote><blockquote>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts.  To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.  </blockquote><blockquote>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate.   </blockquote><blockquote>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September  (<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Important Update on Concord</a>), certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.  We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </blockquote><blockquote>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.  I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.  </blockquote><blockquote>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.   </blockquote><blockquote>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.  Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible. </blockquote><blockquote>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.   </blockquote><blockquote>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams.  I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.   </blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for your continued support.  </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/firewalkstudios_firewalk-is-signing-off-one-last-time-firewalk-activity-7257092832086089729-20Uf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post on LinkedIn </a>from Firewalk Studios said that the studio "began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience." It notes that it began as a new startup in 2018, built a customized FPS engine, and more. The post goes on, "We took some risks along the way – marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters – and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them. Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">First released on August 23 for PS5 and PC, Concord struggled at the outset with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation">low concurrents</a> before Sony suddenly announced it was pulling the plug on September 3.

Xbox, EA, Riot, and other publishers have all experienced layoffs in the past year, and Playstation-owned Bungie announced cuts in August <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-says-it-remains-committed-to-destiny-after-layoffs-will-reveal-plans-for-multi-year-journey-soon">impacting around 17 percent of the studio</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are signs of trouble for PlayStation's other live service games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's called Champions Tactics and it sure looks like...something.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Three years ago, Ubisoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">promised it would start making its own blockchain games</a>. Now it appears to have done it, having stealth-launched a full-blown web3 game last week called Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Champions Tactics is billed as a "PVP tactical RPG game on PC", and is both developed and published by Ubisoft. It involves collectible figurines of various warriors from the in-game fantasy world of Grimoria, which players assemble into squads of three and then battle in turn-based combat that looks oddly reminscent of Darkest Dungeon, of all things. It's not evident from the trailer that this is a web3 game at all, but a quick glance at the game's website or even its official <a href="https://twitter.com/ChampionsVerse" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter page</a> reveals this immediately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The web3 comes into play as a method of collecting figurines to battle with. When you first start the game, you're given some temporary figurines to play with, but you'll eventually need to either purchase actual figurines, aka NFTs, from other players using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency, or craft your own using the "Forge" system which also requires either in-game currency or crypto. At the time of this piece, five days after launch, the in-game marketplace has figurines for sale ranging from around $7 to a whopping $63k for something called a "Swift Zealot". That said, just because a figurine is listed for that much doesn't mean people are paying that much. The next-highest listed champion currently runs around $25k, and while a handful more cost thousands the high-end stuff mostly appears to be capping around $335.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Champions Tactics is free to download, though you have to have a Ubisoft account and a supported blockchain wallet to actually play it. While it appears you can technically play the game entirely for free without ever engaging with NFTs using in-game currency, the viability of this strategy is likely going to be dependent on how the prices for actually powerful characters fluctuates over the game's lifespan. It's a PvP game, with no campaign and no PvE beyond a "Training" mode, so free-to-play players will inevitably be at the mercy of people willing to engage with the NFT marketplace and spend real money to buy or forge the absolute best champions — a real pay-to-win dilemma. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One other limiting factor in playing Champions Tactics is its age rating. Ubisoft lists the game as Adults Only, and restricts players who have not confirmed they are 18 or older from playing. Oddly, while Ubisoft is using the ESRB's rating category, Champions Tactics doesn't appear in the ESRB's online database listing all games with ratings and why those ratings were issued. IGN has reached out to the ESRB for comment and clarity on what's happening here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the fact that Ubisoft is doing basically exactly what it said it was going to do, it seems odd that the company is going all-in on web3 like this now. Whatever gamer enthusiasm for NFTs and blockchain there was in 2021 has died down significantly, with companies like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-will-not-allow-nfts-or-blockchain-technologies">Mojang</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gabe-newell-nft-steam">Valve</a> outright rejecting them, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-not-driving-hard-direction-nfts">backpedaling on an initial enthusiasm</a>, Sega <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-scales-back-blockchain-plans" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">determining it's boring</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestops-nft-marketplace-closes-next-month">GameStop's own efforts outright failing</a>. Even <a href="https://quartz.ubisoft.com/Game:7c788439-f696-4362-8848-d719eeb3e9d2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft's own past efforts with NFTs</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/ubisofts-first-nft-experiment-was-a-dumpster-fire/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely failed to resonate</a> and subsequently gone quiet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which maybe explains why Ubisoft has been, not necessarily secretive, but not exactly loud about this game in front of what most would consider mainstream gaming audiences. Champions Tactics was announced back in June of 2023 and various news items have floated out over the last year about its progress, largely reported at outlets focused on web3 and NFT news. But it wasn't exactly headlining with this game at Ubisoft Forward or anything.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-nft-blockchain-web3-elixir">companies who are still pushing the technology</a> have yet to answer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-were-passing-on-blockchain-pitches" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing concerns</a> about its frequent use in and as scams, its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially massive environmental impact</a>, and perhaps most critically for gaming, how blockchain technology is good or useful for video games in the first place. Ubisoft, to its credit, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-quartz-nfts-reconsider-environmental-impact">expressed concerns before</a> about the environmental impact of NFTs, and the blockchain that Champions Tactics uses (Oasys) claims to be "<a href="https://docs.oasys.games/docs/whitepaper/solution/ecosystem-design%20copy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environmentally friendly</a>". But fundamentally, Ubisoft's perspective on the tech seems surprisingly bullish; the vice president of its Strategic Innovation Lab  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-exec-says-gamers-dont-get-it-when-it-comes-to-nfts">seems to think gamers just "don't get it." </a>Whether or not they can be made to "get it" via games like Champions Tactics remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to Ubisoft for comment on the game ahead of this piece's publication. We asked them for any information on the Adults Only rating and its absence from the ESRB website, as well as for general comment on why Ubisoft is continuing to pursue a web3 strategy and if it intends to continue to do so in the future. Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, responded as follows:</p><blockquote>The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis —much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft as a whole has been having a rough several years, weathering a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-has-officially-stopped-development-on-ghost-recon-frontline">steady</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">cadence</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">game</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">three</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-hit-by-more-layoffs-in-customer-service-and-elsewhere">rounds</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-lays-off-124-employees-to-enhance-collective-efficiency">layoffs</a> in the last year, a series of AAA releases <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">failing to meet expectations</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">general investor frustration</a>.

			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle developer MachineGames has shared new details about the game's story and world structure. In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-devs-interview-machine-games-lucasfilm-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>, Creative Director Jens Andersson said:</p>
<p><em>Well, in a way it's obviously a linear, very driven story that takes you around the world. We are doing this game a little bit differently than previous games that we worked on, where we're allowed to go back to previous locations and continue playing from there. It's almost like a time jump back. So you will be able to 100 percent the game on a single save lot. And the reason why we're doing it like that is that we have these really wide, big areas like Giza, and then we have stretches of more linear rollercoaster rides, and there's a lot of optional content in there... a lot of hidden mysteries and things like that. So we want players who focus on the story to be able to play through it, and if they really love an area, they can go back and just finish up everything without having to replay the more linear sections. It doesn't fit into the narrative story, but from a gameplay perspective, you can do it.</em></p>
<p><em>It's more of a linear story, to be honest. It's really well-told, well-acted by our amazing cast with a proper conclusion. And then you can keep going and discover everything that the world has to offer.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Andersson also talked about giving players the option to tweak combat and puzzle difficulty separately in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Understandably, there are more options for combat (Light, Moderate, Hard, and Very Hard), while there are only two versions of the puzzles.</p>
<p>By the way, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> our own hands-on preview of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle based on a play session from a recent press event. Here's what Amy had to say:</p>
<p><em>Overall, I had a great experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and I can't wait to dive back into the world once more when the game officially releases. It was highly immersive, the characters were well-designed, the world design was stunning, and it was a really well-polished experience. It's perfect for those who are new and returning to the Indiana Jones franchise, or want a game that feels similar to what Tomb Raider and Uncharted offer</em></p>
<p>The game is out on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzards-return-to-office-mandate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The QA workers for Activision Blizzard have recently been on strike in protest of the company's return-to-office (RTO) mandate, as stated by the Communications Workers of America (CWA). On October 25, the QA team who worked on <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> rallied to make sure that there were work-from-home (WFH) accommodations for those who needed them. In this strike, they claimed that Activision and Microsoft had not granted any accommodations for employees with ADA-certified medical conditions. In addition to the QA team striking, over 300 Activision employees signed a petition earlier in the month to ask for the return of work-from-home options. This led to workers in Texas and California joining the Eden Prairie team in striking.</p>
<p>In a statement from the CWA, they wrote: "Despite multiple requests from the Union representing the video-game workers, Activision and Microsoft have been unable to articulate why specifically they are insisting workers must work in the office, even those with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home."</p>
<p>In addition to the CWA writing a statement, the pro-worker group A Better ABK also published their <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own statement</a> on October 25 on X, which stated that RTO was decided on the staff's behalf without their input or needs being considered. "We've also learned that the company is unwilling to provide people with remote work accommodations, even when it's the only option that meets an employee's needs, due to this alienating policy," says A Better ABK. It's not a surprise that those working for Activision Blizzard are consistently having to fight for better conditions, as A Better ABK has been working on improving the quality of life of ABK employees for a number of years.</p>
<p>Just shortly after they put out a statement, it was announced that the CEO of Microsoft got a pay raise of 63%, raising his salary to $73 million, despite there being an excessive amount of layoffs at the company and Microsoft subsidiaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard made a statement to Eurogamer</a>, saying that it understood "returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum."</p>
<p>Whether this means that they will make the accommodations needed for their staff is uncertain as of right now, but they are also far from the only company that is trying to push for RTO. For example, other huge companies such as Ubisoft and Rockstar have also been trying to get their staff back into the office to work on big releases, which has also led to protests from Ubisoft staff.</p>

        <p>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studio— Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.  </p><p>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams. We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations.   </p><p>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts. To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.  </p><p>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate.   </p><p>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/09/concord-to-be-taken-offline-on-september-6-as-sony-interactive-entertainment-determines-the-best-path-ahead">An Important Update on <em>Concord</em></a>), certain aspects of <em>Concord</em> were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline. We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </p><p>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit, and dedication.  </p><p>The player-versus-player <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,556 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a> genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from <em>Concord</em> and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.   </p><p>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE. Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible. </p><p>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.   </p><p>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams.  I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.   </p><p>Thank you for your continued support.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It earned a 7/10 in GameSpot's Rise of the Ronin review.</p><p>With a fast-paced combat system benefitted by a nice variety of abilities and weapons and an engaging story filled with interesting characters, Rise of the Ronin is a solid choice for action-RPG enthusiasts--as long as you're willing to put some time into it without giving up. It doesn't have a strong opening, and the combat system has a rather steep learning curve. And like many open-world games, there's a fair amount of repetition in both the environments and mission structures. But a 7/10 is the type of game that really benefits from a nice discount, as it's less of a gamble when it costs $40 instead of $70.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Available Ahead Of This Week's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/targets-exclusive-shadow-the-hedgehog-lego-set-is-discounted-just-weeks-after-its-release/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-and-peach-starter-sets-get-first-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">New Lego Super Mario And Peach Starter Sets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-movie-tv-series-box-set-collection-amazon-halloween-deals/1100-6527353/">Best Horror Movie 4K Box Sets And Steelbook Deals At Amazon Ahead Of Halloween</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-limited-time-amazon-deals-all-6-dune-books-for-38-4k-box-set-for-lowest-price-yet/1100-6527343/">Dune Limited-Time Amazon Deals - All 6 Dune Books For $38, 4K Box Set For Lowest Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">Disney has just revealed loads of new content for its hit life-sim adventure game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Dreamlight Valley</a>--including details on the game's newest free update and next paid DLC. The announcement was made via a 23-minute showcase hosted by Dreamlight Valley community managers Rachel Annen and Ryan Blanchard, who kicked things off by sharing a redemption code for a pair of free in-game socks (more on those in a minute).</p><p dir="ltr">The hosts then moved on to discuss the six free updates the game has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-dreamlight-valley-review-great-game-grueling-grind/1900-6418193/">since its release</a>, along with its paid expansion DLC, A Rift In Time. It seems <em>another</em> free update is on its way to Dreamlight Valley, with a focus on quality-of-life improvements. The Sew Delightful update launches for free on December 4, and its so packed full of new features, it's practically bursting at the seams.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, Disney added Jack Skellington to the game via The Pumpkin King Returns update. It seems that Disney has decided to build on this plotline for 2024's holiday season, as Jack's beloved Sally will join him in the Valley when Sew Delightful goes live, bringing her patchwork style to the game in the form of new furniture, clothes, and other customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">Plot-wise, Sally has gotten lost outside the Valley. It's up to players to team up with Jack to "make sense of Sally's creepy-crawly messengers as they craft a plan to reunite with her." Later, once Sally has settled in and adjusted to Dreamlight life, players will need to help her embrace the art of quilting, figure out the meaning of her latest premonition, and set up a spooky-sweet date night with Jack, among other activities.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Sally's Friendship Rewards, game manager Guillame Sauveur confirmed the Dreamlight Valley team stitched together a ton of patchwork loot to fit Sally's spooky-cute aesthetic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391723-sallydrip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391723" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391723-sallydrip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391723"></a><figcaption>The free Sew Delightful update brings Sally--and her sense of style--to Dreamlight Valley.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391723-sallydrip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Well, inspired by [Sally's] sense of style, you can expect tons of patterns across clothing items and furniture," Sauver said, adding that the new update "Just <em>screams</em> 'Sally!'"</p><p dir="ltr">"This winter, we'll be embracing the ethereal sides of the [holiday] season," Courtney said of the update's new Star Path. "You'll get to step into your own personal fairytale with ice-adorned furniture and bring a sense of whimsy to your Dream Snap submissions with a wand that produces snowflakes."</p><p dir="ltr">The Sew Delightful update also introduces a new feature: magic-infused areas called Floating Islands.</p><p dir="ltr">"These [Floating Islands] act as additional spaces parallel to the Valley, where players can decorate and let their creativity run free," Sauveur explained as a time-lapse recording showed that Floating Islands have day and night cycles. "Each biome in the Valley will have a Floating Island counterpart with the same theme and ambiance [as the biome], but it will start as a clean slate. We plan to roll these out over time, and we'll kick things off with four floating islands in the Sew Delightful update."</p><p dir="ltr">The first four Floating Islands are Plaza Island, Forest Island, Sunlit Island, and Frosted Island, and can be purchased using the game's main currency, Dreamlight. Floating Islands are roughly the same side as their ground-bound Valley counterparts, giving players double the real estate to decorate. Players will also be able to visit each other's Floating Islands during Valley Visits. All previously collected houses, furniture, and decor--along with befriended villagers--will also be available to place on Floating Islands.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ultimately, the goal is to offer ample space to create without [the Floating Islands] feeling overwhelming," Sauveur said. "We will have more to share about the exact size of the Floating Islands a little closer to launch."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391724-ddlvfloatingislands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391724" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391724-ddlvfloatingislands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391724"></a><figcaption>Floating Islands offer players even more room to decorate.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391724-ddlvfloatingislands.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Sew Delightful update also includes a new feature players have been requesting since the game's launch: the ability to rotate items more easily. Previously, players could only rotate items in four directions. As of Sew Delightful's launch, players will be able to rotate items in a total of 16 different directions, making house and furniture placement much less tricky.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to details on the Sew Delightful update, the Dreamlight Valley showcase also revealed a roadmap listing the contents of future free updates. The roadmap includes an Aladdin- and Jasmine-themed event set to take place in early 2025, an Alice In Wonderland-themed update scheduled for Spring 2025, and a tropical mystery players will have to solve at Skull Rock (home to Neverland's pirates) sometime in Summer 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the showcase revealed Storybook Vale (Part 1), a paid expansion that whisks players away to the titular world. Unfortunately, the likes of Maleficent and Hades have twisted the gorgeous, peaceful setting into a spooky world that players must navigate, solving puzzles and helping residents to restore Storybook Vale to its former glory. The expansion features tons of new collectible items, including new fish to catch, new berries to pick, and even harvestable lightning strikes--a reference to the gods of Mount Olympus and everyone's favorite on-fire baddie, Hades. Hades' feud with Maleficent has torn the realm apart, and references to both villains (and their origin stories) can be seen throughout the DLC.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391727-ddlvmalnhades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391727" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391727-ddlvmalnhades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391727"></a><figcaption>The Storybook Vale DLC sees players working to repair a world torn in two by Hades and Maleficent/</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391727-ddlvmalnhades.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Expansion passes let us recapture the feeling that we gave players the first time they stepped into the Valley, telling a whole new story with new villagers to meet, mysteries to unravel, and biomes to make all your own," creative director Josh Labelle explained. "They're a great way for us to deliver just a huge amount of content to players."</p><p dir="ltr">Labelle also revealed that unlike A Rift In Time--the game's first expansion pass, which arrived in three parts--Storybook Vale will be told in two parts. Part 1, titled Welcome To The Vale, launches on November 20. The second expansion, called The Unwritten Realms, is scheduled to release sometime in Summer 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"With this new format, you'll get just as much content without as long of a wait," Labelle said.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, players won't need to pay for Part 2 of the expansion. Just like with the game's initial, three-part expansion, buying Part 1 of Storybook Vale will automatically unlock the second half of the story when it launches this summer. Just like A Rift In Time before it, Storybook Vale will be available to purchase for $30 USD when it launches on November 20. New players can purchase the Disney Dreamlight Valley base game, A Rift In Time, and The Storybook Vale via the Dreamlight Valley Enchanted Edition bundle, which is available for $80 USD. Players who purchase and play The Storybook Vale by November 30 will also earn the Keeper Of Lore outfit for free (the item will arrive via the in-game mailbox).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391729-ddlveditions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391729" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391729-ddlveditions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391729"></a><figcaption>There are a multitude of ways for players old and new to get their hands on the upcoming DLC.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391729-ddlveditions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All in all, Dreamlight Valley players have tons of new content to keep them busy well into next year. But for anyone eager to get their hands on some Dreamlight Valley content immediately, we've got you covered. Players can use the following codes to unlock free in-game loot right now:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">"DDVSOCKS2024" unlocks two free pairs of Halloween-themed socks (thigh-highs and crew socks) for player-characters to wear in-game.</li><li dir="ltr">"DDVBOWHB2024" unlocks a blue hair bow with a sparkle design on one half.</li><li dir="ltr">"DDVJJACKET2024" unlocks a purple denim jacket with torn sleeves.</li></ul>

            <p>
Firewalk Studios, the Sony-owned developer behind ill-fated PlayStation shooter Concord, has been shut down, and the game will remain permanently offline despite earlier suggestions it could return. Sony's mobile-focused developer Neon Koi has also been closed.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">confirmed Firewalk's closure in a post on its website</a>, sharing an email from Sony Interactive Entertainment boss Hermen Hulst sent to the company's employees earlier today. "We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities," Hulst wrote. "As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE's Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios - Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios."
</p>
<p>
"Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams," Hulst added. "We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognise when our games fall short of meeting player expectations."

<p>
"Certain aspects of Concord were exceptional," Hulst continued, "but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline. We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options [and] after much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication."
</p><p>
"The PvP first-person shooter genre is a competitive space that's continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," Hulst added. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."
</p>
<p>
Concord has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">offline since the start of September</a>, when it was pulled from sale just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release, amid suggestions it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less than 25,00 copies</a>. At the time, Sony said the game would remain offline indefinitely so Firewalk could "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players." Later that same month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-director-reportedly-steps-down-as-studio-awaits-sony-decision-on-games-future">Concord game director Ryan Ellis had stepped down</a> and that remaining staff at Firewalk were in limbo while they awaited Sony's decision on the future of the game. Firewalk - which employed 150-170 people - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">acquired by Sony last year</a>, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">massive live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to Firewalk's closure, Hulst announced Sony is shutting down its mobile-focused Neon Koi studio (formally Save Game Studios) and cancelling the developer's action game. "Mobile remains a priority growth area", Hulst insisted in his email to employees, "[but] we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios' pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally... I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate."
</p>
<p>
"I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE," Hulst continued. "Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organisation. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible.
</p>
<p>
"I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.
</p>
<p>
"While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams," Hulst concluded in his statement. "I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organisation driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been officially confirmed that Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios, the game developer behind Concord. It isn't too surprising that this has happened, especially as Concord didn't land in the market the way Sony wanted it to. From the start of Concord's official release, it seemed that this was the way that Firewalk Studios was going to go. It's really unfortunate, as this was their first game with a lot of talented people, but the game wasn't marketed well, and it was a premium hero shooter in a sea of free-to-play hero shooters. Additionally, as soon as Concord was closed down and those who purchased it were refunded,<a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/"> the Director of Concord</a> stepped down. It was noted by many who worked at Firewalk Studios that the developers still left at the studio were in limbo, and many also expected Firewalk Studios to be shut down.</p>
<p>It has now been confirmed by Jason Schreier that Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios in a <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1851318988489248986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851318988489248986%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>. Additionally, a<a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full internal email</a> has been posted on the Sony Interactive Entertainment blog, where an internal email from Herman Hulst, the CEO of Sony has addressed the closure. However, in this email, not only did they announce that Firewalk Studios is being closed down, they also announced Neon Koi's closure, and the mobile action game they've been working on will no longer be going forward.</p>
<p>Regarding Concord and Firewalk Studios, Hulst's statement says: "Certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players... We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options." Hulst then goes on to explain that Concord is being permanently sunsetted, and Firewalk Studios is being closed. This means that Concord will not be going free-to-play after all, after it was noted that the files of the game were<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-rumored-to-still-be-updating-on-steam-potential-to-go-free-to-play/"> still being updated</a> on SteamDB.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is a lot of uncertainty about where the staff affected will end up. The statement by Hulst says, "Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible." The number of staff they are looking to relocate and hire internally isn't stated, but it's possible that the numbers will come out in future updates as Firewalk Studio staff and Neon Koi staff members respond to the tragic news of both studios being closed.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 developers, Grinding Gear Games, have revealed that their early access launch has been delayed for three weeks, with the new date set as December 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Path of Exile 2’s Game Director, Jonathan Rogers, revealed through a statement on <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1851096646140166559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that the game’s early access will have to be delayed. Rogers explained that they are not behind on “the game itself” but on “some service-side infrastructure work” that is taking much longer than intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers elaborated that keeping up with one of Path of Exile 2’s key promises is one of the major reasons for the delay. The team promised that all microtransactions would work across both titles, Path of Exile 1 and 2. However, to accomplish this feat, the developers have had to integrate the account systems for both games and console ports; they have changed the backend code and are conducting a bunch of load testing, which is time-consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roger believes the game will still be complete by the launch date, but not without mistakes, and the developers don’t want these errors to happen. Hence, Path of Exile 2’s early access has been delayed by three weeks. Moreover, details about all the content players can expect during POE 2’s early access will be revealed through a live stream “in about four weeks.” This will be the biggest announcement Grinding Gears Games have ever made.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: According to <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1851332241051513093?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Sony’s closures of Firewalk Studios and Neon Koi will result in 210 people being let go in total. Firewalk sees 172 people lose their jobs while Neon Koi is another 38.</p>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios. The news was first broken by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, and Insider Gaming was quickly able to corroborate with sources. </p>



<p>Sony made the announcement public shortly after the news broke in a message on its <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>

<p>“We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities,” PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst said. “As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hulst says that over the last few months the team at PlayStation explored “all [their] options” regarding the game. Despite those efforts, however, the decision was made to close the studio and sunset the game for good.</p>



<p>“After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio,” he said.  ” I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued: “I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.&nbsp; Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization.”</p>



<p>Concord launched in late August to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 1,000 players</a> on Steam and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 25,000 copies sold</a>. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/">game was shut down</a> two weeks later with talk of a potential return as a possible free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Ultimately, that didn’t happen and Sony has moved on. There was no mention by Sony if all employees will be let go or move to other areas within the company.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for clarification on employment status for those at Firewalk Studios and Neon Koi.&nbsp;There have been nearly 14,000 known jobs lost to layoffs in 2024 within the games industry across nearly 160 companies.</p>



<p>You can read Hulst’s full memo to staff below.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>Dear Team,&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Today, I want to share some important updates from Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams.&nbsp; We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts.&nbsp; To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September, certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.&nbsp; We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.   I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.&nbsp; Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization.&nbsp; Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams.&nbsp; I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.  &nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for your continued support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

The bundle is available in three tiers--the best of which gets you <strong>18 digital comics valued at $189 for just $18</strong>. That's an impressive offer, and since it doesn't end until November 11, you have plenty of time to cash in on the deal.</p><p>This Humble Bundle lets you pay any price for the collection, and depending on how much you spend, you’ll unlock a different number of comics. Spending $18 or more is the best option, as it’ll get you the full 18-comic bundle, which equates to $189 worth of comics. There’s also a seven-comic bundle for $10 and a two-comic bundle for just $1.</p><p>We've outlined the full list of comics included in each tier below, but some highlights include Dragon Age: The Missing, which bridges the events between Dragon Age: Inquisition and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Mass Effect: Foundations Volumes 1-3, which flesh out the backstories of companions characters from the beloved sci-fi RPG series. All comics in the bundle are delivered as PDF and CBZ files, allowing you to read them on a variety of devices, including your smartphone, PC, Kindle, or tablet.</p><p>As with all Humble Bundle promotions, a portion of all sales goes to charity. The Dragon &amp; Mass Effect Digital Comic Bundle supports Child's Play, which helps install gaming systems in children's hospitals and donates video games to patients.

			<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is about to launch, BioWare is expected to largely move on to the next Mass Effect game, the studio's next project. After all, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in March 2023, a sizable amount of the Mass Effect team temporarily helped with iteration and polish for the latest Dragon Age game; the favor is likely to be returned from now on.</p>
<p>Speaking of The Veilguard, some fans aren't too keen on the game's art style. Indeed, I had some criticism on that count myself in the otherwise highly positive review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> yesterday:</p>
<p><em>From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal.</em></p>
<p>Michael Gamble, who has been the Executive Producer of the Mass Effect series for a long time, has now <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850994136629068091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reassured</a> fans on Twitter that the art style will be photorealistic, as it's been the case with previous entries:</p>
<p><em>Lots of people asking me about Mass Effect now that Veilguard reviews are out, and Oct 31 is close. Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a Sci Fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs...and has to have different kinds of love. Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it.</em></p>
<p>Gamble also added that the sci-fi franchise would keep the mature tone of the original trilogy, although, on that note, I would say neither Andromeda nor Dragon Age have been any different.</p>
<p>It may be a long time before we see anything concrete about the next Mass Effect. Preproduction has been going on for a while, and we even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-teaser-trailer-direct-sequel-to-me-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> a very early teaser trailer showing off an aged Liara T'Soni back in December 2020. However, as insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-four-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> a while ago, it will take at least three years of production from now on.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned teaser trailer and subsequent rumors, it seems BioWare will follow up on the original trilogy rather than keep the action in the Andromeda galaxy, given that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 game</a> hasn't captivated the audience nearly as much as the previous games. However, we'll have to wait until we hear from the studio to know for sure.</p>

            <p>
I missed my chance to write about Hollywood Animal when a certain Nic Reuben swooped in like a rival showbiz talent scout and pinched the summer Steam Fest demo from right under my nose, capitalising on the fact that I was stranded in an airport at the time. I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-do-not-remember-minesweeper-featuring-this-much-horrible-ai-porno-spam-or-cranial-trauma">a very rude Minesweeper "homage"</a> instead. Hopefully that was for the best. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025. To celebrate, they've also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

<p>
As you might guess from the title and my cunning intro allusions, Hollywood Animal is a tycoon game in which you set up your own film studio at the dawn of sound cinema. You'll buy and furnish buildings such as script and post-production departments, hire a bunch of actors, writers, producers and other minions, and get to work generating a little stardust. 
</p><p>
It's all very involved, and not just at the level of production technicalities. You can dispatch private investigators to gather dirt on your whiniest employees, and bribe the mayor to overlook your many, many crimes. You can time and market the release of your movies perfectly after studying your competitor's projects, or simply ask the mafia to "clear the calendar". This is Hollywood's "golden age" in the sense that it's shiny and cold and hard and people will kill for it.
</p>
<p>
Nic might be a dirty, no-good thief, but his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollywood-animal-is-a-nifty-and-detailed-golden-age-simulator-populated-with-eminently-hireable-alcoholics">demo write-up is a lot of fun</a>. "Each film is rated for both 'audience approval' and 'artistic appeal'," he noted. "This may seem like an unnecessarily stringent binary, but remember this was pre-Boss Baby, so no-one knew you could master both yet."
</p>
<p>
The devs are calling it "a box of spiders disguised as a tycoon game". Good job, whoever came up with that line. I wish it was me. If you need further convincing, there's a new demo on the way in December.

Fascinatingly, it turns out 2024 has another, perhaps unexpected contender for funniest game of the year on the way, and it carries a hat and whip. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle stirred up several different feelings within me over the two or so hours I played at a recent preview event. The violent thrill of combat. The brain-tingling joy of solving ancient puzzles. I even felt a little lump in my throat upon hearing the instantly recognisable notes of John Willams' Marion’s Theme as Indy discovered a note from his now-distant love interest. But the overriding thing I did when playing was grin with childlike amusement. The Great Circle delivers physical comedy on par with the Hitman series, and looks set to be a worthy successor to IO’s World of Assassination trilogy when it comes to creating laughs through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - October 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a moment in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when an over-confident Harrison Ford turns to his on-screen father, played by Sean Connery, to calm his fears about an incoming Nazi tank. “Dad, we’re well out of range”, he says, moments before that very same tank fires a shell that destroys a jeep 20 yards behind them. A combination of sharp scriptwriting, pinpoint performances, and Steven Spielberg’s masterful ability to play action scenes for both thrills and laughs within seconds of one another, it’s a useful reminder of just how humorous the Indy films are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s very encouraging then that, from what I’ve played so far, the Great Circle is continuing that legacy of action comedy. Pushing enemies off high ledges and hearing their steadily fading Wilhelm screams is one thing, but it's in the malleable disposable weapons system that the chuckles really emerge. During an under-the-cover-of-night infiltration of the Vatican I had too much fun picking up any old item I could and bonking unaware guards over the head with them. Trucheons, shovels, umbrellas, and <em>three </em>different stringed instruments all collided with the backs and skulls of my unsuspecting prey. The combination of everyday object whistling through the air before hitting its bemused target with a thud made me laugh every time. It’s a simple pleasure, but maybe I’m a simple man.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It all built up to my pièce de résistance, though, as I foolishly threw a pocketed biscotti at an Italian bruiser.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It all built up to my pièce de résistance, though, as I foolishly threw a pocketed biscotti at an Italian bruiser. It dealt no damage but did make for a sweet moment of puzzlement on his face before he raised his fists to cover it. It felt like the punchline in an unwritten Indy adventure, one where a desperate Dr. Jones tries his luck with whatever’s in his bag and comes up desperately short. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s this willingness for the Great Circle to let you play with your food – and many other household items – that reminded me of the childish joy that IO Interactive’s Hitman games deliver in spades (sometimes literally). Indy may not have the gameplay design flexibility that Agent 47’s missions possess – given a banana, our favourite archaeologist’s actions would likely be limited to either thumping with or throwing it, instead of laying it down as a trap – but the essence of Hitman’s physical action comedy is absolutely there to be felt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Great Circle may not share Hitman’s freedom of approach, it does try to include a number of pre-baked opportunities. For instance, on a trip to an excavation site at the Great Pyramids of Giza, I had to turn on a generator in order to power an elevator. Doing so electrified the water around me and fried a couple of unsuspecting members of the Third Reich. Whipping guns out of Nazi fingertips and witnessing the shock on their faces is also a thrill, as is wrapping it around their ankles to trip them up. And disguising yourself as a local dig worker shares the same feeling of naughtiness that dressing as one of 47’s many, many outfits does. Get caught and you’ll have to fight your way out of the situation, the panic in itself creating comedy and reflecting Indy’s clumsy, sometimes bumbling nature, as you grab hold of anything close and chuck it at anyone with a swastika on their sleeve.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>MachineGames’ level design encourages you to survey the arena and find a smarter, or potentially funnier solution to each action puzzle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a professor of history who fancies himself a swashbuckling archaeologist, after all, not a full-blooded action hero. This is best displayed in the game’s opening encounter, where he is quickly knocked out by the man mountain of a mysterious figure played by the Candyman himself, Tony Todd. This rough and tumble is really what I’ve enjoyed about the Great Circle’s combat and general approach to enemy encounters so far. You’d maybe imagine something a lot closer to Uncharted, with vast swathes of battle between the archaeological finds, but in reality, I only shot a gun twice in over two hours. Developer MachineGames’ level design encourages you to survey the arena and find a smarter, or potentially funnier solution to each action puzzle. It’s far more fitting for the character and what we’ve seen from him on-screen for over five decades now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this talk of player-led gameplay should not fully overshadow the great job that MachineGames has seemingly done when it comes to the more authored aspects, though – the story, world, and characters. The tone feels authentically Indy and the snappy writing, combined with Troy Baker’s uncanny Ford impression, goes a long way to evoking the pulpy tone of the original movie trilogy. Jones comes across as that delightful blend of smarts, sarcasm, and cockiness that made us fall in love with him the first time around. A combination of tickling one-liners when delivering knockout punches and charmingly crafted cutscenes, such as Indy's horror at having to feed a friend’s pet snake, are genuinely funny.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It all links back to MachineGames and Bethesda’s collaborators, LucasFilm, and, indeed, the beloved LucasArts games of the 90s. Hits such as The Secret of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, and of course, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis were not only incredibly fun point-and-click adventures but often hilarious. Not only brilliantly written, they frequently delivered laughs through gameplay and the bizarre use of items such as rubber chickens and balloon animals. It’s exciting to see MachineGames embrace this use of everyday objects as comedy props, too, as well as the more expected humour that traces back to the studio’s Wolfenstein series that also poked fun at the Nazi regime. If B.J. Blazkowicz can find himself auditioning for Hitler at his Venus base, just think of what bizarre situations the Swedish studio has in store for Indy, who himself is no stranger to the occult or otherworldly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say I find myself very encouraged by what I played of the Great Circle. Its willingness to be silly, but never compromise smart gameplay systems for cheap laughs, is hitting a sweet spot for me that I want out of an Indiana Jones game. With the tone nailed, I’m left very excited to uncover the full adventure in December. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Stick and stones may break Simon Cardy's bones but fedora hats and whips excite him.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-developer-finally-gets-the-hardest-achievement-in-his-own-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It only took him eight years.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of Stardew Valley just earned the most challenging Steam achievement available in his own game, eight years after it was released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851124749994455547" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on X/Twitter yesterday</a>, developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone revealed that on October 25, 2024, he officially earned the last remaining achievement he needed for 100% completion of Stardew Valley. The achievement is called "Fector's Challenge", and it requires the player to beat in-universe minigame Journey of the Prairie King without dying. Only 1.2% of players had the achievement at the time Barone earned it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally got 100% achievements in Stardew Valley <a href="https://t.co/hoaSmDnTWi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hoaSmDnTWi</a></p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851124749994455547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Journey of the Prairie King is an arcade game the player can access in the Stardrop Saloon. It's a top-down, twin-stick shooter where the player must shoot enemies that appear in waves from all sides of the screen while avoiding touching both enemies and their projectiles. The player starts with four lives, and extra lives are available as rewards, so in order to just beat Journey of the Prairie King it's not necessary to never die. You just have to avoid dying too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Barone did is considerably more intense. It requires not dying at all, not even once, a pretty challenging feat especially if you've ever seen what gameplay of Journey of the Prairie King looks like. There are three stages total, with the first stage including four levels plus a boss, and the second and third stages each including three areas and a boss. The enemies get more difficult and varied the further you go, and collecting good upgrades at certain points is critical to survival, so there's at least some element of luck involved too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So even though Barone made this ridiculous challenge, it's not exactly surprising that he would struggle to finish it himself on a regular playthrough of Stardew Valley, especially since he probably has better things to do with his time than practice Journey of the Prairie King. Congrats to ConcernedApe! Good luck to the rest of us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley remains a masterpiece even eight years later, with our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">re-review earlier this year</a> saying that "eight years of updates have grown Stardew Valley into a modern classic with an endless list of enticing activities to complete and a deeply satisfying time management challenge to take on." Its latest update, 1.6, is out now on PC and is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-console-and-mobile-16-update-finally-has-a-release-date">finally coming to consoles on November 4, 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
