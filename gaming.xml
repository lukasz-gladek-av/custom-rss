            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/2024-year-to-date-spending-is-1-higher-than-a-year-ago-says-circana-report/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Circana report highlights how the Video Game Market is currently performing. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-digital-next-gen-sony-nintendo/">Mat Piscatella</a> posted the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l6ah7w2xev2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results from the report</a> on BlueSky. This report comes from August 2024, so it's slightly out of date by this point, as we are fast approaching November 2024. The report's projected U.S. total spending on video game hardware, content, and accessories fell by 7% during August 2024 compared to last year. Considering the current state of the games industry right now, this isn't as bad as it could be. The positive of the financial report is that 2024 year-to-date spending is now 1% higher than it was a year ago, coming in at $36.6 billion.</p>
<p>Most of the gaming spending right now is on mobile content, with a 5% increase, which was offset by declines in other categories. Video game content spending has increased by 4%, with 3% of it being driven by mobile spending. Accessories for gaming saw an 8% increase, which helped to offset the 28% drop in video game hardware spending.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>At the moment, the gaming industry is in a rocky place, and most places in the world are in some kind of financial crisis, which makes spending on games, accessories, and particularly hardware quite tricky. In addition to this, games are increasingly expensive, especially for triple-A games. For those on PC, purchasing new gear and upgrading pre-existing rigs are difficult, as new games require more powerful rigs to run even on minimum settings.</p>
<p>During August, top games across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox saw a lot of sports games coming out on top, including Madden NFL 25, EA Sports College Football 25, and EA Sports MVP Bundle.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Star Wars Outlaws took the third position of best-selling premium games in August. Considering that the game didn't sell as much as Ubisoft had hoped, gamers across the globe poorly reviewed it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-patch-released-playercount-triples-as-a-result/">Helldivers II</a> remains in the top charts, as well as Minecraft being a continual mainstay in the reports released by Circana.</p>
<p>The report states that August video game hardware spending dropped by 36% compared to the previous month. All consoles have significantly decreased, but the Nintendo Switch has suffered the most, with a sharp decline year-on-year by 41%. In this report, the PlayStation 5 led the month's hardware in both unit and dollar sales. In future reports, it's likely that the PlayStation 5 will continue to lead, as they have announced the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th Anniversary collection</a> and the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>In August, the PS5 DualSense Wireless Controller in Midnight Black was the best-selling accessory in dollar sales, with the PlayStation Portal continuing to be the best seller for 2024. It's possible that the PlayStation 5 Pro and the 30th Anniversary Collection will soon be in the best-selling reports in the future.</p>

Featuring a female protagonist, a new mountainous landscape to traverse, and all set in a new time period 300 years after the events of the first game. </p><p><strong>Jump to</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#release-date">When is it coming out?</a></li><li><a href="#story">Story details</a></li><li><a href="#setting">Setting</a></li><li><a href="#development">Development</a></li></ul><p id="when-is-it-coming-out"><h2 data-toc-title="When is it coming out?" id="release-date">Ghost of Yotei will be released in 2025 on PlayStation 5</h2></p><p>The exact release date is still unknown, but Sony has confirmed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">Ghost of Yotei will arrive on PlayStation in 2025. </a>Sony tends to favor fall release windows - see God of War, The Last of Us 2, Spider-Man: Miles Morales -  and it wouldn't be a shock for Ghost of Yotei to follow the same pattern. Expect the game to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive at first, but as with big Sony titles like God of War Ragnarok and Horizon Zero Dawn, it will almost certainly get a PC release at some point in the future too. </p><p id="story-details"><h2 data-toc-title="Story Details" id="story">Ghost of Yotei has a new protagonist </h2></p><p>The Ghost of Tsushima sequel will start a new origin story with Atsu, a young woman seeking revenge. Details on her story are few and far between, but the trailer did reveal some interesting clues about the newest warrior to take on the mask of The Ghost. </p><p>For a start, Atsu can dual-wield katana, a talent that was never available to Jin Sakai in the first game. It could suggest that Atsu might prefer the direct approach to the stealthy methods that Jin could use to avoid and assassinate enemies. For all you accuracy fans out there, this detail actually lines up with historical records that suggest dual wielding wasn't a common practice in Japan during the time period in which Jin lived, but in Atsu's 17th-century world, the swordsman Miyamoto Musashi created the "two heavens as one" niten'ichi technique with two blades.</p><p>While some fans reacted with surprise at the gender of Ghost of Yotei's new samurai, female warriors called Onna-musha appeared in Japanese history as early as 1180. You can read more about on how Ghost of Yotei gets history right here. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ghost of Yotei</h3></div></output><p id="setting"><h2 data-toc-title="Setting" id="setting">There's a new setting for Ghost of Yotei </h2></p><p>The name gives away the new setting for the game, but for those of us that skipped a few geography classes Yotei refers to Mount Yotei - translated somewhat unglamorously as "sheep-hoof mountain" - a volcano located in northern Japan. Specifically on Hokkaido, the second-biggest Japanese island, which would have been called Ezo in Atsu's time. </p><p>“When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves is ‘What is the DNA of a Ghost game?’” Creative Director Nate Fox told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>. “It is about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan.” The Sucker Punch team visited a number of locations in Japan for research, including Shiretoko National Park where Fax made recordings of the ambient sounds to take back to the studio. </p><p>“Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears,” Fox said. “Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying. We strive to bring that into the video game — that feeling of danger.”</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is set in 1603, according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>. That's 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima and a period when Ezo was home to the indigenous Ainu people and still outside the control of Japan. Perhaps not coincidentally, 1603 is marked the Tokugawa shogunate becoming the government of Japan after the Battle of Sekigahara.</p><p id="development"><h2 data-toc-title="Development" id="development">Ghost of Yotei is Sucker Punch's first game built completely for PS5</h2></p><p>Ghost of Tsushima was notable for the way its incredible landscapes looked and felt as you explored the island, and it sounds as if we can expect the same from Ghost of Yotei.</p><p>"This is also Sucker Punch’s first game built from the ground up for PlayStation 5, and we’re excited to build on the visual foundation we established in Ghost of Tsushima by making the world feel even more real," said Andrew Goldfarb, Senior Communications Manager at Sucker Punch Productions in a blog post.</p><p>"We have massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, whole new skies featuring twinkling stars and auroras, even more believable movement from wind on grass and vegetation, and more improvements we’ll share in the future. Our new setting also gives us the opportunity to introduce new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons."</p><p><em>Rachel Weber is IGN's Managing Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Better still, it's an adventure that can be put into any ongoing campaign just in time for Halloween.</p>
<h2><em>The Darkest Woods</em> TTRPG Adventure Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.montecookgames.com/announcing-the-darkest-woods/">official post</a> on their website, Monte Cook Games explains what players can experience in <em>The Darkest Woods</em>. The titular woods, called the Backwoods, is home to mythic witches, horrific monsters, hateful spirits, cannibalistic cultists, and other dangers. It is a place that tests the mettle of all who enter it.</p>

It is a detailed, immersive adventure that can be integrated into any setting or game system. Whether you play <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> or anything using the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monte-cook-games-announces-cypher-system-open-license" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cypher</a> </em>system, this adventure has you covered.</p>
<p>In addition, this adventure is designed to be easy for GMs. Every area in the adventure has two maps. One with tags for the GM; the other tagless for players. The book even has a large collection of handouts and downloadable soundscapes. All greatly help establish a scene and atmosphere for the table.</p>
<p>.If you have played a similar adventure released by Monte Cook, <em>The Darkest House</em>, this new adventure is a standalone companion developed by the same creative team. Just replace the gothic haunted house atmosphere with sinister folk horror trappings.</p>

<p>The Darkest Woods will be coming together through a crowdfunding campaign on Backerkit. The campaign will include a phyiscal version of the adventure alongside a digital version. At time of writing, there is no launch date.</p>

            <p>Tomb Raider 1-3 got the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">remaster treatment</a> earlier this year, and surprise surprise, now Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered is on the way. That'll include Angel Of Darkness, of course, the entry of the sexology that could most obviously benefit from some TLC.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The remasters are being handled by Aspyr in partnership with Crystal Dynamics, as per the original trilogy remaster. This new batch includes 1999's Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, 2000's Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and 2003's much maligned Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness. All three are playable with their original graphics or with higher poly models and more bloom, as well as new camera controls, quality-of-life updates, and photo modes.
</p>
<p>The set are due to release on February 14th for £25, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525380/Tomb_Raider_IVVI_Remastered/">they're up on Steam now</a>.
</p>
<p>Core Design released the first five Tomb Raider games on a yearly schedule from 1996 to 2000, but The Angel Of Darkness was intended to modernise the series and make the leap onto PlayStation 2. Development was beset with problems, chunks of the game were scrapped to hit deadlines, and what was released was buggy and difficult to control. It sold reasonably well but reviews were dire and development of later Tomb Raider games moved to Crystal Dynamics. Core Design closed not long after.
</p><p>Which, as I noted above, makes Angel Of Darkness perfect fodder for a remaster. I've seen others argue that there's a hidden gem beneath its many faults, which I find difficult to believe, but it would be great were that true.
</p>
<p>Katharine wasn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-1-3-remastereds-modern-controls-are-an-absolute-travesty">entirely convinced by some of the modernisations</a> in the last remasters, mind. You could play them as God intended, with tank controls, or with a new modern control scheme Katharine thought was a "travesty".</p>
<p>The previous remaster had the odd, unwiedly name of Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft, whereas this one is just Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered. How am I to know if it stars Lara Croft or not if she's not mentioned in the title? Most confusing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Reports have emerged that Microsoft is planning to start letting gamers stream titles from their own Xbox game libraries starting next month. This would finally fulfil a key part of the Project xCloud plan that been delayed multiple times as the service morphed into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-cloud=gaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> as part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">The Verge reports</a> that what is known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft is finally nearing completion. Though this will still go through their standard public testing procedure, starting with Xbox Insiders in November, and gradually broadening to more and more users, and to include more games.</p>


<p>This will come alongside Microsoft’s announced update for the Android Xbox mobile app, which is set to enable game purchases within the app in the US – something Microsoft is able to do after a court ruling this week has forces Google to allow other billing methods in the Play Store on 1st November.</p>
<p>When it was still known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-xcloud">Project xCloud</a> in 2019, Microsoft confirmed their intention to let users start streaming their purchased games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-50-games-dualshock-4-pc-coming-to-japan-canada-india-europe-2020/">in 2020</a>. While Xbox Cloud Gaming itself launched in 2020, purchased streaming was pushed back to 2022… but never materialised. Cloud Gaming has always been restricted to games in the Xbox Game Pass library, and even then isn’t completely universal.</p>
<p>Microsoft took a softly, softly approach to the rollout of Cloud Gaming, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/04/xbox-game-pass-xcloud-streaming-15-september-dualshock-4/">starting off with just 50 games</a>, and having limited touch control support for select games. It’s grown a lot since then, so now pretty much every game coming to Game Pass is also available in the cloud. Still, having a curated selection of a few hundred games available for streaming is a big difference to having thousands and thousands of games.</p>

<p>There’s obviously the technical challenge of having all this game data available for all servers, the need to test for compatibility and weed out games that just don’t play well with streaming, but there’s also licensing issues as well. The Verge states that some publishers will hold back some games due to licensing requirements or deals.</p>
<p>In general, this will be a great fallback for gamers who want to play off-menu from Game Pass while they’re away from their main console. Let’s say you want to play some Space Marine 2 (which isn’t in Game Pass) over Christmas, but you can’t take your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Series X</a> to your family’s home or hog the TV. This would let you get a few Operations in.</p>

            <p>Steam now shows customers a message to let them know that they're buying a license when making a purchase through the storefront, rather than any outright ownership. The change has been implemented internationally in response to new California legislation due to take effect next year.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When viewing a game in your Steam shopping cart, a message is now shown under the "Continue to payment" button. "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam," it reads. A link underneath goes to the Steam Susbcriber Agreement, which explains the terms of the license in more detail.
</p>
<p>The new California legislation, <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426">AB 2426</a>, which was signed into law in September, is designed to warn customers of the potentially transitory nature of digital purchases. Storefronts cannot use terms such as "buy" or "purchase" without sufficient caveats explaining the nature of the agreement to customers.
</p>
<p>Some digital game purchases are excluded, such as in instances where the game can be downloaded and played permanently offline. GOG, for example, which offers downloadable DRM-free executables for all games sold, doesn't need to offer any such caveats. 
</p>
<p>That prompted the storefront to do a good bit of trolling today. "Since checkout banners are trending, we're thinking of putting one up ourselves. Thoughts on this one?", <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">they tweeted</a>. The proposed checkout banner reads: "A purchase of a digital product on GOG grants you its Offline Installers, which cannot be taken away from you."
</p><p>Typically when a game is removed from sale on Steam, it remains playable in the libraries of those who previously bought it. Other storefronts have removed games from libraries outright, however. Earlier this year, Ubisoft closed down The Crew, rendering the online racing game entirely unplayable, after which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">some players reported it had vanished from their Ubisoft Connect libraries</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve managed to avoid the majority of the hype surrounding Metaphor: ReFantazio up until this point, then you may not realize the JRPG is currently in the running for GOTY from many outlets, critics, and players. It’s an exceptional adventure by developer ATLUS—the renowned studio behind Persona—that requires <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-beat-metaphor-refantazio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 100 hours to complete a single playthrough</a>. But once you finish the tale, it’s the type of game that sticks with you, begging you to find something similar. Here are some games to play after Metaphor: ReFantazio!</p>







<p>I’m not going to judge you if you finish Metaphor: ReFantazio and immediately dive into another massive JRPG, losing hundreds of hours of free time to yet another adventure. In fact, I’ll live vicariously through you. What I can do is recommend a few top-rated titles that feel similar to Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>



<h3 id="h-persona-5">Persona 5</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another hit JRPG from developer ATLUS; <strong>Persona 5</strong> continues the long-running franchise’s theme of placing you in the shoes of a transfer student at a high school in Japan, albeit with a supernatural twist. Following a strange dream, you don the mask of the Phantom Thief; you’ll explore the city of Tokyo, customize your hideout, participate in turn-based combat with a group of young heroes, and spend upwards of 100 hours in the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-granblue-fantasy-relink">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gathering a party of heroes is a staple in an ARPG, but especially in a JRPG, and <strong>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</strong> allows you to do that while taking the adventure to the skies. You’ll soar across floating islands, engage in real-time combat using various weapons and skills, tackle quests in single-player or co-op with up to four players, and uncover the world’s lore and story one step at a time.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The latest from Square Enix to finally launch on PC, <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong>, tells the story of Clive Rosfield, a warrior tasked with protecting his young brother, Joshua, from a mysterious entity known as the Dark Eikon Ifrit. You’ll fight with swords and Eikons as you venture across the land in a story-driven JRPG that spans tens of hours on a single playthrough.</p>



<h3 id="h-nier-automata">NieR: Automata</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those who prefer a more action-oriented experience,<strong> NieR: Automata</strong> provides a story-rich experience that, while often recommended amongst the greatest of JRPGs, feels more like a beat-em-up-style game akin to Devil May Cry. It’s a lightning-quick adventure following 2B, 9S, and A2 in a world overrun with machines and monsters.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-all-achievements-in-metaphor-refantazio-and-how-to-unlock-them">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/achievements-metaphor-refantazio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Achievements in Metaphor: ReFantazio and How to Unlock Them</a></h6>



<h3 id="h-tales-of-arise">Tales of Arise</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you enjoy the anime art style of Metaphor: ReFantazio and want more like that from your JRPGs, then <strong>Tales of Arise</strong> might click with you. It’s an expansive JRPG with a living world and stylistic combat that should entice action-oriented fans of titles like NieR: Automata. You’ll chain attacks, utilize multiple party members for combo attacks, and delve into a continent-spanning adventure that leads you across Dahna.</p>



<h3 id="h-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>But then, if you don’t want to play an anime-style game because the aesthetic doesn’t vibe with you, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth should satisfy the massive JRPG itch without the overly bright color palette. Ichiban Kasuga and Kazuma Kiryu return for this expansive entry that takes you out of Japan and places the story in Hawaii for the first time. There’s mini-games, party-based combat, and all the usual wackiness from the franchise!</p>

            <p>I was a few days late with the news when I wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-managers-biggest-technical-and-visual-advancement-for-a-generation-arrives-november-but-sports-interactive-are-keen-to-lower-expectations">last week</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 2025</a> had confirmed its release date for this November. Now I know that I shouldn't have bothered: Sports Interactive have now delayed FM2025 until March 2025.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"In our last Development Update in September, we explained that we needed to push FM25’s original release back to give ourselves more time to deliver the best possible experience for this first instalment in a new era of Football Manager," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2217490/view/7081438768274917137">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>"This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards.
</p>
<p>"In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted – despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done.
</p><p>"Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible."
</p>
<p>Football Manager 2025 is intended to be a technologically leap and a "true sequel" in a way entries in the iterative series normally aren't, as Sports Interactive ditch their internal engine in favour of Unity. It's also, because of the rebuild necessary, going to lack some of the features typical to the series, including several game modes and international management.
</p>
<p>SI say that a previously planned "new gameplay reveal" will now shift to the end of January 2025. Ahead of FM2025's release in March, however, Advanced Access will return on PC and Mac, letting pre-orderers start playing a beta of the game early. They say they'll confirm how early as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>I've no problem with a delay, particularly if it means developers aren't crunching to finish something. I look forward to giving FM2025 a whirl whenever it does arrive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if you’re not a fan of social sim RPGs or <em>Dragon Ball</em>, you might be lacking a piping hot new release to play with your precious downtime. Not to worry, we’ve got an assortment of games, new and old, that we can’t wait to get back to this weekend, and there’s sure to be something here to thrill and entertain you as well.<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Be gay, get out of this town</p><p>I know very little about <em>Beloved Rapture</em>. But a friend of mine slid into my DMs and told me Rapturous Studio’s SNES-inspired RPG was gay as hell, had “heartbreak and angst between boys in like the first hour,” and was full of “leaving your hometown vibes.” Friends, that is Kenneth Shepard-coded as fuck. I slapped the money down right then and there. I just wrapped up <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>so I don’t really <em>need</em> to play another turn-based RPG right now. I am, however, always in need of more gay shit, so here’s hoping <em>Beloved Rapture </em>delivers. I don’t have much else to say about the game yet because I only know that it’s not an exhaustively long RPG, it’s all about sad boy shit, and there might be kissing. I really don’t ask for much else in my video games. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Make my stronghold a little nicer</p><p>If I’m honest, most of my gaming time this weekend will probably go, once again, toward <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865">the incredible <em>UFO 50</em></a></span>. (I now have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/carolynmichelle.bsky.social/post/3l67a6cuct72z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/carolynmichelle.bsky.social/post/3l67a6cuct72z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my first two cherry carts</a></span>!) However, it’s probably time I start mentioning other games on occasion here in the Weekend Guide, so instead I’ll talk about something else I’ve been playing lately, <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, the 2015 fantasy CRPG from Obsidian Entertainment which follows in the footsteps of genre-defining classics like <em>Baldur’s Gate </em>and <em>Icewind Dale</em>. It’s absolutely epic in scope, immediately thrusting you into a world with its own rich, captivating history and lore—a world we’ll soon get to revisit in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-preview-obsidian-rpg-pillars-eternity-1851631371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-preview-obsidian-rpg-pillars-eternity-1851631371"><em>Avowed</em></a></span>—but it’s also intimate and personal, with exceptionally well-written characters navigating life in a world filled with conflict and strife.</p><p>Early on, your character is awakened to their skills as a Watcher, someone who can see and interact with the souls of others. This not only allows for some great fantasy RPG plot hooks, but also brings the history of the game’s world to life in a way it otherwise wouldn’t be. You might, for instance, encounter someone who, in a past life, was part of the marauding hordes driving others out of their homes, and see how their soul was marred by the trauma of participating in something so monstrous, or you might be pulled into the experience of someone who was persecuted by those hordes. William Faulkner famously wrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” It’s true of our world, I think, and in <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>’s Eora, you really feel the way that the past lingers, shaping and haunting the present.</p><p>Of course, all the great pleasures of CRPGs are here—gorgeous lands to explore, engaging tactical combat, epic quests—and all of that is crucial to what makes <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>so exceptional. But for now, I’m particularly smitten by the writing, so smart and so rich, and characterized by a tremendous respect for the player, trusting us to come to grips with the world and its history upon being thrown in head-first, and trusting us to appreciate its profound thematic depth without needing to spell things out for us or lampshade what it’s doing. It’s so great to encounter genuinely mature writing in a game, especially when it’s married to gameplay as rich and captivating as what’s on offer here. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> An Android tablet<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Actually play it</p><p>I’ve half a feeling I might have listed this as my weekend game a month or two back, but as I’ve previously established, these entries are all somewhere on the border between wishful thinking and outright lying. The reality is I’ll play <em>Fortnite</em> with the boy and <em>Balatro</em> at night when he’s asleep. But I <em>have</em> actually started playing <em>KOTOR2</em> on Android this week, and am impressed with how not-actually-unplayable it is with a touchscreen.<br></p><p>It’s not <em>great</em>. I think it might have been designed for that one guy in <em>Total Recall</em> with the third arm in his chest, given how I need to tap the middle of the screen as well as hold either side. (Or maybe that lady with the three boobs, now that I think about it.) But Obsidian’s writing and the mostly solid voice acting is a joy to revisit, encouraging me to push through its slightly wonky controls. Perhaps I’ll finally get my Xbox controller hooked up to my Pixel Tablet, as ridiculous as that will feel when I could just be playing this on Xbox. — John Walker<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, Phones, PC<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Enjoy the new spooky event</p><p>I’ve been busy playing other games, like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, for my job here at <em>Kotaku</em>. So this weekend, with a bit of free time, I’m going to check out the new Fortnitemares event in <em>Fortnite</em>. Halloween is my favorite holiday, October is my favorite month, and I love spooky events in video games. So yeah, I’m excited to hop in and see all the new skins and check out the changes made to the game’s battle royale map. I’m also pumped to add Leatherface and Billy the Puppet from <em>Saw </em>to my <em>Fortnite </em>skin collection alongside Michael Myers and <em>Alien</em>’s Xenomorph. Though, after being away from the game for a few weeks, I’m nervous that I’m going to get rocked when I return. But hey, at least I’ll die as a creepy horror movie icon. — Zack Zwiezen<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Complete the Buu Saga</p><p>It’s probably been close to 15 years since the last time I played <em>Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em> with my brother on Wii. We unlocked everything, played a ton, and did not mind at all wiggling the Wiimotes like idiots to trigger special moves. We’d play for hours at a time, crafting ridiculous matchups all the while, and he more than once wiped my whole team with just Arale. I still can’t quite wrap my head around the fact that all this time later, there’s now essentially a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589"><em>Budokai Tenkaichi 4</em></a></span> that is not just a celebration of the anime its based on but, so far at least, a surprisingly robust and absolutely gorgeous arena fighter (at least when the camera isn’t swirling around underneath the map as things descend into pure chaos).</p><p>I’m having such a blast with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-yajirobe-senzu-bean-tier-op-1851669930&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-yajirobe-senzu-bean-tier-op-1851669930"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em></a></span><em> </em>at the moment that I don’t want to put it down, even though I know<em> Metaphor: Refantazio</em> and<em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>are absolutely going to destroy my schedule this month. This weekend, at least, I’m stepping into the hyperbolic time chamber and figuring out how to master <em>Sparking Zero</em> without the help of motion controls. And right after that, I’m settling down to watch<em> Dragon Ball Daima</em> because I’m still obsessed with what is unquestionably my generation’s <em>Star Wars</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft again teased that cloud streaming would be expanded to games outside of Game Pass <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-samsung-streaming-demos-halo-f-1849039557&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-samsung-streaming-demos-halo-f-1849039557">near the end of 2022</a></span>. “We’re excited to share that later this year, it’s our intent to roll out the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play, from the cloud, select games they already own or have purchased outside the Xbox Game Pass library,” Xbox editorial head Will Tuttle <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/06/09/whats-next-for-gaming/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/06/09/whats-next-for-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote at the time</a></span>. That never materialized either, though. </p><p>Two years later, it sounds like whatever technical snags or other problems were previously interfering have finally been smoothed over and Microsoft is ready to begin expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming in earnest. That initiative would be coming alongside a recently announced move to begin selling Xbox games directly inside of the Xbox app on Android devices <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following a court mandate against Google</a></span>, as well as a recent increase to the price of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription from $18 a month to $20. </p><p>This new version of Xbox Cloud Gaming would bring it much closer to Nvidia’s GeForce Now which lets users stream PC games they already own to other devices, including less powerful PC hardware that wouldn’t be able to run those games natively. The biggest difference is that Nvidia currently offers that perk as part of a free subscription tier, albeit with notable caveats like lower resolution and timed sessions. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Has he wandered into some kind of supernatural space situated around a small American town, created by cultists and elder gods? Or is he dead and in Hell, paying for his sins?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake's Biggest Differences</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, developer Bloober Team seems to provide more details and clues related to those questions. In doing so, the developer has expanded the story of Silent Hill 2. The remake, it seems, isn't just a revision of the story--it's an expansion of the original, existing separately from the original Silent Hill 2. In the same way that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-438559">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> revisits the same story while adding to it to make something new, Silent Hill 2 Remake is a secret sequel of Silent Hill 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Silent Hill 2 included several hints that what James was experiencing was something more than it appeared to be. Wandering through the town, players would come across several bodies of people apparently killed by the vicious monsters James repeatedly fights off. What was weird about these bodies, though, was that while their faces and heads were often covered or obscured, fans noticed that they often seemed to be wearing bloodied versions of James's clothes.</p><p dir="ltr">In the 2001 Silent Hill 2, it's a little bit tough to tell what's going on with this choice--did the developers intend for players to see just a bunch of nondescript bodies, and used the James character model as a cost-saving measure, because the game just didn't really include many other characters? Or were these bodies meant to be a subtle hint at something deeper happening in Silent Hill? A theory developed around the latter, culminating with a particular body in the Wood Side Apartments building, which appears to have died by suicide, and though their face is covered, they look <em>suspiciously</em> like James Sunderland. It's a theory of the game that suggests James is already dead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382981-silenthill2suicide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382981" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382981-silenthill2suicide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382981"></a><figcaption>Fans have speculated that this man, who seems to have shot himself, is James since the release of the original game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382981-silenthill2suicide.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill 2 Remake makes some changes to the elements of the Silent Hill 2's story, puzzles, and combat, but it's still pretty faithful to the broad strokes of the original tale. In fact, as you navigate through the town in the remake, you'll find bodies killed by monsters. And just like in the original game, those bodies look a lot like James Sunderland.</p><p dir="ltr">Scattered throughout the town are notes, usually found near those bodies, scrawled in a bloody and manic hand. Several have the same messages as were seen in the original game, but there are more in the Remake. They suggest these other people were also trapped in Silent Hill, and for some, apparently for a long period of time. A few leave behind warnings and information, such as a map of Silent Hill like the one James carries that's annotated in the same way he marks up his own. Some speak directly to the reader, hoping you can use what was learned before you to move ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">The more of them you read, though, the more they sound like they were written with James in mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Somewhat later in the game, you can find notes next to a James-looking body that relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-endings-how-to-unlock-all-endings-including-new-ones/2900-5831/" data-ref-id="2900-5831">one of the game's new endings</a>. Though the handwriting is different from some of the other notes--others look like they were written hastily in all-caps printing--this one looks to provide some serious hints about the situation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382980-silenthill2_20240927162701.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382980" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382980-silenthill2_20240927162701.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382980"></a><figcaption>Bodies all over Silent Hill seem to be wearing the same clothes as James.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382980-silenthill2_20240927162701.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I can leave by not leaving," it reads. "I can <em>only</em> leave by not leaving. The deal is done. He said he left it for me. Where they once were."</p><p dir="ltr">This note puts you on the path to unlocking the new "Bliss" ending, added with the remake. If you follow the clues, you'll eventually find a hallucinogenic drug called White Claudia. Taking it at the right time in Lakeview Hotel, before James watches the video tape, triggers the ending. Instead of coming to terms with the fact that he killed Mary, it's almost as if James hallucinates another course of events, willing himself to stay with Mary before her illness, happy in his delusion of denial.</p><p dir="ltr">What's weird about the note is that it suggests the writer has been struggling to leave Silent Hill, just like James is. It also makes reference to "where they once were." That location is Pete's Bowl-o-Rama.</p><p dir="ltr">Players familiar with the original game know that James finds Eddie and Laura at the bowling alley, where <a href="https://youtu.be/WigHmhur3G0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he infamously berates the man for eating pizza</a> while the town is overrun by monsters. The bowling alley is still there in the remake, but it's empty. You instead encounter Eddie and Laura in the movie theater; the gist of the scene is similar, but it plays out slightly differently, with James being less antagonistic. "Where they once were," then, seems to suggest the writer of the note is aware that James previously found Eddie and Laura at the bowling alley, but they're not there now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382982-silenthill2_20241007213445.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382982" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382982-silenthill2_20241007213445.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382982"></a><figcaption>This note is found on another conspicuous body near the end of Nathan Ave.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382982-silenthill2_20241007213445.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In other notes, you get the sense that the writer is driving James on. A message found in a safe in Brookhaven Hospital, in the office of the hospital director, reads as a letter written for James.</p><p dir="ltr">"Their images became blurry, melting together," it says. "Not sure if I can do it, but maybe you can. This will take you where you need to be, though probably not the way you want to. And there's bound to be some pain involved. There always is."</p><p dir="ltr">Accompanying the letter is the key to the hospital's roof. A few seconds after you get up there, you encounter Pyramid Head, who throws you <em>through </em>the floor of an elevator shaft so that you wind up in a previously locked-off section of the third floor. It takes you where you want to go, though not the way you want to, and there's some pain involved.</p><p dir="ltr">There's another particularly revealing note you can find inside Wood Side Apartments.</p><p dir="ltr">"You must think I'm cruel," it says. "But this is a prison of your own making. The choice was yours. I watched you make it. Over and over and over again. This time's not gonna be different. And I'll be here. Watching."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382983-silenthill2_20240928115355.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382983" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382983-silenthill2_20240928115355.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382983"></a><figcaption>Moments like Maria finding the outfit her character wears in the original game are fun Easter eggs, but taken literally, they also work as evidence that James has been here before.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382983-silenthill2_20240928115355.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill 2 Remake seems to be making it pretty clear. Those bodies <em>are</em> James; many of the notes in the game are about him, or possibly even written by those other versions of him. He's trapped in Silent Hill, not just during the course of one playthrough of the game, but through all of them. He's in some sort of time-looping hell, playing out the course of these events over and over again. The original Silent Hill 2 documented one set of James's experiences. The remake is another. He's experiencing them all in some kind of endless torment.</p><p dir="ltr">Three different times through the course of Silent Hill 2 Remake, you encounter Eddie near a dead body that he claims he had nothing to do with. These bodies are tougher to identify than the others we've discussed--until, that is, you reach your final scene with Eddie. At the end of the labyrinth section, Eddie's anger finally reveals that he's been murdering these people all along. Shouting, he fires a revolver into the body of his latest victim, and if you look closely, you can see who it is.</p><p dir="ltr">It's James.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382988-silenthill2jamesbodyeddie.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382988" data-ratio="0.78960096735187" data-width="827" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382988-silenthill2jamesbodyeddie.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382988"></a><figcaption>As Senior Producer Kurt Indovina discovered, in the cutscene where Eddie fires his gun at a corpse, you can see in the muzzle flash that the body appears to be James.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382988-silenthill2jamesbodyeddie.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Or at least, it sure does look like him.</p><p dir="ltr">You fight Eddie in a frigid slaughterhouse warehouse filled with hanging cuts of meat, where you eventually kill him. But as these other James bodies suggests, sometimes, he kills you. What's more, the two of you repeat this process continually. Eddie kills James. James kills Eddie. But both characters are trapped in Silent Hill, reliving their sins and their horrors over and over again.</p><p dir="ltr">In your last encounter with Angela, the third soul seemingly condemned to Silent Hill, she walks up a staircase wreathed in flames. When James comments on the heat, Angela asks if he can see it. "For me, it's always like this," she says, seemingly revealing that she experiences Silent Hill in a way that's markedly different from what James does.</p><p dir="ltr">In the remake, in every scene where you find Eddie, you can see his breath, as if he's in a cold room--even though you don't see James's breath in those same places. It's like Eddie is always somewhere cold, even if no one else is. Angela's Silent Hill is alight with fire; James's Silent Hill is foggy and filled with monsters seemingly meant to torment him over his lustful, treacherous feelings and actions; and Eddie's Silent Hill, it would appear, is always cold and filled with death. Just like you briefly see into Angela's Silent Hill at the end of her story in the fiery staircase, it seems that in the slaughterhouse, you briefly see into Eddie's Silent Hill.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382991-silenthill2angelaitsalwayslikethis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382991" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382991-silenthill2angelaitsalwayslikethis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382991"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill 2 Remake heavily implies that James, Eddie, and Angela are all trapped in Silent Hill, reliving and paying for their sins, over and over again.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382991-silenthill2angelaitsalwayslikethis.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All these tidbits and pieces of information suggest that Silent Hill 2 Remake <em>isn't</em> a remake per se; it's another trip through the hellish loop for James, and everyone else. And in fact, every time you play the game is another repetition of that loop. Each conclusion of the story--whether it sees James coming to terms with his actions, replacing the sick Mary with the idealized, sexier Maria, taking his own life in Toluca Lake, or choosing a delusion where he ignores what happened to Mary--seems to also represent another loop. Every time you die in the game is a trip through the loop. Each body you find is James, a loop terminating in his death, only for him to find himself again at the road overlooking the town.</p><p dir="ltr">So every ending in Silent Hill 2--except, maybe, for the jokey Dog and UFO endings, although even that might be kind of debatable--is as legitimate as any other. They're all, seemingly, happening. James reaches them all, but none of them end his torment.</p><p dir="ltr">With Silent Hill 2 Remake, that fan theory about it being James lying dead in that chair, seemingly having shot himself, is confirmed, at least in this game. And with that, the game becomes much more horrifying. There is no escape from Silent Hill.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is reportedly set to significantly expand Xbox Cloud Gaming's capabilities next month, introducing the ability for Xbox players to stream any of their purchased games.
</p>
<p>
To date, Xbox Cloud Gaming's streaming features have only been available across a select number of Game Pass titles, but Microsoft has long had ambitions to enable players to stream any game they own. And that feature, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">now writes</a>, is nearly here.
</p>
<p>
Citing "sources familiar with [the company's] plans", The Verge says Microsoft will introduce the ability to stream "thousands" of Xbox titles - not just those available via Game Pass - starting in November, as part of a long-running internal initiative known as Project Lapland.

<p>
It's a feature that was reportedly originally due to launch as part of Project xCloud back in 2020, but one that's been repeatedly "complicated by having to prepare key infrastructure for thousands of games". And even with the feature now supposedly close to launch, it's said "some" publishers will still hold certain games back "due to licensing requirements or deals".
</p><p>
According to The Verge, the ability for players to stream any game in their Xbox library through Xbox Cloud Gaming will initially launch for Xbox Insider testing at some point in November, and will then be expanded to more users and more games.
</p>
<p>
The claim follows this week's news it'll soon be possible to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-will-soon-be-available-to-purchase-in-the-xbox-app-on-android-in-the-us">purchase Xbox games via the Xbox App on Android devices</a> in the US - a move that would dovetail nicely with expanded Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming capabilities for mobile users.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battle has all the players scrambling for alternate paths for all eight characters. These paths allow you to explore a completely new storyline, very different from what players are used to in the canon series. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battle guide will help you better understand all the different branching paths for Goku in the Android/Cell Saga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before getting into it, players should know that these branching routes can only be unlocked by completing certain tasks or challenges during battle. Additionally, completing an entire branching episode rewards you with 100,000 Zeni, a bunch of XP, and other items. This guide will take you through all the different paths available for Goku in the Android/Cell Saga and the conditions you must meet to unlock them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-canon-story-line">Canon Story Line</h2>



<p>To follow the canon storyline for Goku in Sparking Zero’s Android/Cell Saga, players need to make decisions according to the events that occurred in the anime. When Gohan and Goku wait to enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, they suddenly realise that Piccolo is in trouble. Here, you are given two options: “Go Help” or “Wait for Vegeta and the others”. If you choose “Wait for Vegeta and the others”, events will follow the same path as the anime.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-changing-future">The Changing Future</h2>



<p>To explore this path for Goku in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles, players must select the ‘Go Help’ option. Once you have chosen this path, a new line of events pops up, where Goku and Gohan go save Piccolo instead of entering the Hyperbolic Time Chamber to train. Goku uses his Instant Transmission to reach Piccolo and then starts fighting Cell.</p>



<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. For players that don’t want to know what happens next, skip to the <em>Homecoming</em> paragraph.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Goku and Gohan abandon training on this path, and Goku goes to fight Cell alone. He somehow manages to overcome Cell, and that’s when Android 16, 17, and 18 want to kill him. However, Goku easily defeats them, too, leading to the trio’s withdrawal from battle. Teen Gohan cannot become the formidable warrior we know and love in this storyline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-homecoming-nbsp">Homecoming&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Homecoming is an additional ending you can get for Goku in Sparking Zero, but it isn’t an entire path. To get this ending, you need to defeat Cell before the elapsed time is over. If you manage to do so, Goku doesn’t have to die to save Earth, and you will also receive a wholesome cutscene where Goku, Gohan, and Chi Chi are reunited after the Cell Games.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As of next month, Microsoft is allowing those who utilize Xbox Cloud Gaming to stream their own games. The company is doing this as a test, first and foremost, but this could be a game changer financially for their gaming department. It's not an unknown secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-to-cut-another-650-jobs-mostly-in-corporate-and-support-games-wont-be-affected/">their gaming sector</a> is under-performing compared to the other sectors within Microsoft. They are now trying to do everything in their power to remedy that, and it seems that allowing those to stream games that aren't already a part of the Xbox Game Pass library using Xbox Cloud Gaming is part of that strategy.</p>
<p>This particular idea has been part of the long-term project known as Project Lapland inside Microsoft. They have been working on Xbox Cloud Gaming servers to make sure they are stable enough to support streaming thousands of different games, all varying in graphical fidelity and compatibility. It was already mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-for-owned-games-is-coming-this-year-says-spencer/">around seven months ago</a> that this change would be coming, and it's clear that they've been working on changes in Xbox Cloud Gaming, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-rolls-out-mouse-and-keyboard-support-for-26-games/">recently rolled out support for Mouse and Keyboard</a> in a number of games.</p>
<p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion will be happening in the same month that Microsoft plans to enable game purchases in the box mobile app for Android in the US after a lengthy court case that <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/">finally forced Google</a> to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store. This change is huge, and will be finally taking place on November 1. While to many, this may seem like an insignificant change, it means that third-party stores will finally be able to function on the Play Store, something that hasn't been possible for years without managing your payments and subscriptions via Google Play Billing.</p>
<p>Xbox President Sarah Bond revealed that players will be able to play and purchase games from the Xbox App on Android. Microsoft is still ironing out the wrinkles, but once they are done, those who buy the game will be able to stream it to their device immediately.</p>
<p>This update has been in the works for a long time. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-studios-publishing-unveils-cloud-gaming-division-headed-by-kim-swift/">Microsoft first announced</a> this ground-breaking feature of playing your own library of games on Xbox Cloud Gaming in 2022. However, due to a number of complications within the company and the pandemic, it didn't launch that year, and it's only happening now, two years later. There will be thousands of games available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Warren reports at The Verge</a> that some publishers are holding specific games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24267864/steam-buy-purchase-license-digital-storefront<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve is now explicitly disclosing that you don’t own the games you buy from its Steam online store. The company has added a note on the payment checkout screen stating that “a purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-tells-gamers-up-front-that-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-085106522.html?guccounter=1">as reported earlier by <em>Engadget</em></a>.</p><p>We confirmed the message appears in the Steam desktop app, but we haven’t seen it in the mobile app yet. Some Steam users noticed the disclosure go live earlier this week and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0qskq/steam_now_shows_that_you_dont_own_games/">posted their findings on Reddit</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>My colleague Sean is not actually buying this yet; he says he has to play </em>Persona 3<em> first.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Steam</cite></p></div><p>Why? Probably, a new law. California has a law <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426">going into effect next year</a> that’ll require digital storefronts like Valve’s Steam platform to clearly say that you’re only purchasing a license for your digital media because some companies like Ubisoft and PlayStation were removing digital purchases from users’ libraries, keeping them from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-is-deleting-the-crew-from-players-libraries-reminding-us-we-own-nothing-165328083.html">playing games like <em>The Crew</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989290/playstation-digital-ownership-sucks">watching their old Discovery shows</a>.</p><p>The law does <em>not</em> apply to games where you can download an offline installer that can be used without connecting to the internet, like with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2F">Good Old Games’ DRM-free game store</a>.</p><p>There’s speculation Valve went live with the new message to get ahead of the law. The law states digital storefronts must not say you can “buy” or “purchase” something unless that something is a license, and it must link to the terms and conditions of the license — which Valve already seems to have covered.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It seems like every major release wants to become the only game you play for, at the very least, a month before you move on to the next big title. But the problem is there’s something new around every corner. But the JRPG genre doesn’t care about upcoming titles; they live in a world of their own making, and in that world, single-player RPGs span nearly one hundred hours or more. Here’s how long it takes to beat Metaphor: ReFantazio!</p>







<p>If you’ve set the lofty goal of beating Metaphor: ReFantazio shortly after launch, I hope you’re ready for the challenge. The monolithic RPG requires anywhere from 70-80 hours to finish a single playthrough. Some players report taking slightly less time, around 60 hours, and others report finishing in upwards of 100 hours. It depends primarily on your playstyle; how do you enjoy running through an RPG of this immense scope?</p>



<p>I intend to take my time and whittle away at the campaign in the spare hours I can eke out when my little one finally falls asleep, so I suspect it’ll take me months to finish the game!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-all-achievements-in-metaphor-refantazio-and-how-to-unlock-them">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/achievements-metaphor-refantazio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Achievements in Metaphor: ReFantazio and How to Unlock Them</a></h6>







<figure><figcaption>Image via ATLUS</figcaption></figure>



<p>Have you ever played any of the Persona titles? ATLUS, the developer behind Metaphor: ReFantazio, is known for its previous RPG franchise, which follows a group of teenagers dealing with the supernatural. But Metaphor: ReFantazio, while offering the same style of gameplay, as a massive JRPG, sets itself apart as a fantasy-themed adventure. It does retain a similar graphical style and overall gameplay feel, with third-person exploration, large-scale zones, and turn-based combat, but it crafts a new, enthralling adventure of its own!</p>

<p>If you are new to Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, check out the new Episode Battle system, where players can either follow events of the anime or discover a branching path that leads to a brand new conclusion. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guide will cover Vegeta’s branching paths in the Android/Cell Saga.</p>



<p>Players looking to explore these alternative paths for characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles must achieve specific goals during their battles to unlock these new routes. Moreover, the game rewards players who complete these branching paths with an additional 100,000 Zeni, a boatload of XP and some additional items. This guide will explore all the different paths you can take for Vegeta in Android/Cell Saga and the conditions you must meet to unlock them.</p>

<h2 id="h-canon-story-line">Canon Story Line</h2>



<p>Players don’t have to do much to follow the canon path when playing with Vegeta, as his missions are pretty straightforward until the Android/Cell Arc. However, once Vegeta turns Super Saiyan, you will face the first alternative path choice for this character in his battle against Android 18. To follow the canon storyline, do not defeat Android 18 in the elapsed time, and the events will follow the same path as the anime.</p>



<h2 id="h-parental-bond">Parental Bond</h2>



<p>If you can defeat Android 18 before the match ends, players will explore a new path for Vegeta’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode battles: Parental Bond. However, there is one more task players need to complete before they can completely explore this alternative path.</p>



<p>Once players defeat Android 18, Vegeta decides to train with Future Trunks in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Players must defeat Trunks as quickly as possible during this battle to unlock the branching path completely. If they cannot, they will revert to the canon storyline.</p>



<p>To know whether you have accomplished the challenge, you must pay attention to Trunk’s dialogue options. He will continue to hold back against Vegeta if you don’t deal enough damage. However, if you can inflict enough damage, Trunks shows his Super transformation to Vegeta, thus unlocking the new path. You must complete These two tasks to unlock this branching path.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead for the Parental Bond Episode</em></strong></p>



<p>After you defeat Trunks, you witness a new exchange between Vegeta and him. Vegeta acknowledges Future Trunks’ strength and confesses that he knew Trunks was his son. He asks Trunks to train with him in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber so that both can ascend to a level even higher than a Super Saiyan.</p>



<p>Vegeta and Trunks then confront Cell as they did in the anime; however, the encounter is a bit different. Vegeta allows Cell to transform into his Perfect Form as he canonically does; however, this time, he gives Cell a decent fight, enough for Cell to back off and announce the Cell Games Martial Arts tournament.</p>

<h2 id="h-father-son-final-flash">Father Son Final Flash</h2>



<p>Vegeta and Trunks train together to become even stronger until the Cell Games begin. Once they kick off, Vegeta is the show’s star, taking on Cell first and giving him a run for his money. However, Vegeta falls short against the Android and is almost about to die at his hands. At that moment, Trunks intervenes, taking the hit instead of Vegeta, becoming critically wounded.</p>



<p>Seeing his son in pain, Vegeta is enraged like never before and is ready to end Cell. He transforms into Super Saiyan 2 and dukes it out with the villain. The decision of the battle is left to a clash between Cell’s Kamehameha and Vegeta’s Final Flash. It seemed Vegeta would lose for a moment, but in the dying seconds, Trunks backs his father with his Final Flash, and the Father-Son Final Flash finally defeats Cell once and for all.</p>

While there hasn't been any definitive word about a sequel yet, a new report states that Hogwarts Legacy DLC could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Warner Bros. Games is developing a Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition that will feature 10-15 hours of new content including an additional story quest, side missions, costumes, and more. It will reportedly also be available as DLC for gamers who already purchased Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>The report suggests that the Definitive Edition and associated DLC may arrive as soon as 2025 in part because Warner Bros. Games wants to offset the ongoing losses that occurred from the massive underperformance of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-loot-world-order/1900-6418174/" data-ref-id="1900-6418174">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. As recently as last month, Warner Bros. has stated that making a Hogwarts Legacy sequel is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">a top priority</a>." Getting the DLC out may make the wait between the first game and its follow-up more bearable.</p><p>While the franchise also has an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-series-aiming-to-release-in-2026/1100-6521317/" data-ref-id="1100-6521317">upcoming Harry Potter TV series</a> on HBO, the characters and the world created by J.K. Rowling have often been overshadowed by the author's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">anti-trans views</a>, which she continuously shares online and via social media. This has put her at odds with several of the actors from the Harry Potter films, as well as a large number of her fans.</p>
