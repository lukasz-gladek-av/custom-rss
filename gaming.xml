			<p>We’ve finally reached the point that even remakes are being remastered. Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana isn’t just a remaster of a 2010 PSP game being given new life on modern consoles, because even that was a localised port of a 2005 PC remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys back in 1989! Despite, or perhaps because of, all those steps of separation from the original release, the result is one of the most refreshing and immediately engaging entries in this decades-old franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHMjSsm9qi8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>




<p>Even though recent original entries in the series, like last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/ys-x-nordics-review/">Ys X: Nordics</a>, are chasing higher fidelity and expanded gameplay sub-systems, when you look at the gaming landscape at large it’s clear that more and more people yearn for artistically driven and lower fidelity games that wear retro charm on their sleeve. Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana in 2005 was a complete reimagining of Ys III, stepping back from the side-scrolling spin-off from the original series formula to better match the action of Ys IV, but twenty years on from that, it doesn’t try to shoot for the increasingly unobtainable fidelity-focused goals of modern gaming. This release instead celebrates its roots at every opportunity.</p>

<p>In that sense, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana feels like an incredibly timely release – on PlayStation 5 the game certainly runs at a higher resolution than ever and a consistent framerate, but the character models and textures look just like they did on PSP and PC, and you have a choice between original and refined graphics for the dialogue character art. Of the three available soundtrack options, one of them is the original Wanderers from Ys PC-88 soundtrack and the other is the only slightly-less-old-school X68000 soundtrack from the 2005 PC release.</p>

<p>One of the major charming elements of the Ys franchise is that the combat and gameplay was so ahead of it’s time. A groundbreaking, lightning-fast action game from like this from 20 years ago isn’t any less fun or exciting today. You’ll barely be able to see your protagonist Adol Christin on the screen at some points with how fast you’re moving, spinning your blades at waves of enemies and constantly unlocking new attacks and abilities that expand your arsenal. The depth of gameplay and customization here isn’t as deep as more recent Ys entries that give you access to multiple party members or more dynamic sub-systems of character growth, but it never feels like any of that is needed. What’s lost in character-building growth is made up for twice-fold in the increasing amounts of strategy and quick-thinking that bosses will require of you as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>While the narrative of Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana isn’t a major highlight of the experience, it never drags on or over-explains to the point of getting in your way like a few more recent Ys entries do. You’ve got engaging stakes and likeable characters, and they always serve the purpose of propelling you towards your next exciting gameplay moment, and never holding you back from them. Sure, the result means you shouldn’t be expecting some kind of meta-textual brain-melting story experience from this game, but I’m happy to have my brain unmelted when the trade-off is face-meltingly fast and exciting boss battles – even faster if you engage Turbo mode.</p>

<p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana has aged flawlessly, and is the perfect sort of simple, fast-paced action game that anyone can hop into and enjoy. With how expansive and varied the Ys series has become over the years, it’s also an exciting window into the origins of the franchise, and a reminder of why this series has been heralded as Nihon Falcom’s flagship franchise for so long.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-valorant-agent-tejo-revealed-for-season-2025-act-1.1074864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Agent in the form of Tejo, an Initiator with a number of rather intriguing gadgets to his name.</p>

<p>Tejo will arrive alongside Season 2025 Act 1, which is set to debut in just a couple of days. He's a Colombian intelligence consultant with a "ballistic guidance system" that both helps his allies to identify their foes and deals direct damage into the bargain.</p>

<p>First up, Tejo's Special Delivery ability fires a sticky grenade onto the first surface it hits, exploding and Concussing targets caught up in its blast radius. You can also launch the grenade with just one bounce using the alt fire key.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=HhmTWk0d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=VmWEB5g0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tejo is&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s latest Initiator Agent.</figcaption></figure><p>Stealth Drone, meanwhile, allows Tejo to control a drone as it reveals the enemies its pulse hits, as well as Suppressing them. Finally, the Guided Salvo ability hits up to two locations on the map with missiles that detonate as soon as they arrive.</p>

<p>Of course, Tejo also has an Ultimate ability in the form of Armageddon, a tactical strike that delivers a payload of explosives along a custom-set path. It sounds like Tejo won't be for those who prefer their Agents simple, but he'll be a rewarding choice for more skilled players.</p>

<p>Along with Tejo,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Season 2025 Act 1 also brings with it the Flex system, consisting of "handheld objects that [give] players more ways to express themselves in-game". Each player will get one Flex for free, and a second will be available via the battle pass.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to get your hands on the new EX.O skin line, which offers skins for the Vandal, the Sheriff, the Spectre, the Outlaw, and the Katana.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, it's a competitive multiplayer first-person shooter created by&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Riot Games.</p>

<p>The game mixes the objective-based gameplay of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive" rel="nofollow">Counter-Strike</a>&nbsp;</em>with the hero-focused approach of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and the more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, offering players unique abilities for each Agent while also keeping the focus on map control and awareness.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://playvalorant.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Season 2025 Act 1 arrives on January 8th.</p>

            <p>An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Even at a surface glance, Paradise looks like a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">Grand Theft Auto Online</a> pretender with added AI goop - not particularly appealing when placed next to Rockstar's high quality and "hand crafted"  cityscapes. Here's the early trailer for the game:</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="PARADISE ® | Official Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmPZp4Lhi40?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmPZp4Lhi40" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>As you can see, it's very "we've got Los Santos at home". Many elements, including the minimap, map text, and even the beach umbrellas, look identical to those found in either GTA V or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">the trailer for GTA VI</a>. The company have even copied the music and motto from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkiRB7sM_Y4">a fan-made trailer for a now defunct GTA roleplaying server</a>, which was itself called "Paradise Roleplay".</p><p>The biggest tell lands at 1:20, when the narrator announces that you'll "earn money and crypto" while the player character strolls into a bank. Subsequent trailers have downplayed the crypto element, and the same trailer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3281420/Paradise/">on Steam</a> has been edited to exclude that particular word, probably to abide by Valve's rules on marketing cryptocurrency. The company behind Paradise, Ultra Games, say they're no longer going to ship it with cryptocurrency in mind but, as we'll see, the game itself seems to barely matter.</p>
<p>Last month, various YouTubers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CQBMzLjCA">brought up these concerns</a> around the game, including the fact that early trailers showed unlicensed Lamborghinis. Most chutzpah-ly of all, Paradise promised the ability to interact with AI versions of popular influencers like Pokimane and Fortnite streamer Lachlan Power, among many others. However, none of those big-time streamers have said anything about the game on their public channels. The trailer that promises AI cameos of these influencers is still showing on Steam, but the game's website now admits that certain high profile streamfolk won't appear, claiming that "not all contracts were finalized within the expected timeframe."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/paradise-game-ultra-games-gta-copycat-crypto-scam-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ultra Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some accusations made by the YouTubers felt overzealous. Buying and using assets from Unreal's store is not a crime, for example. But considering the many other signs of crypto-dirt, you don't even need to point to cheap assets as proof of suspicious practices. Paradise has more smoking guns than a firing range at West Point. </p><p>Most dramatically, later investigations by YouTuber "Jetro" claim that the company are not based in Hong Kong, as they state on their website, but are allegedly practicing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_5S3JVEY-g">a Russian-backed "pump and dump" scam</a> centred around an app that lets you buy the game's currency - the PAR token - before release. Jetro also points out that the game's Steam listing claims it will utilize kernal level anti-cheat, which "will give the developers full access to everything on your PC," he warns. "For this reason I do not recommend  downloading this game at any point."</p>
<p>Despite all this, the game is still gaining followers on Steam. Paradise had 20,000 followers a month ago, according to <a href="https://games-stats.com/">game-stats.com</a>, and that has since risen to over 30,000 followers. To put this into perspective, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> has around 27,000 followers at time of print, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has around 40,000. It is enough to get Paradise onto the stat site's top ten list of "trending upcoming games". </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/paradise-game-ultra-games-gta-copycat-crypto-scam-3.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ultra Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At a conservative estimate, these follower numbers may translate to about 150,000 wishlists or more (I'm using the calculations figured out by <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/deep-dive-how-steam-followers-and">the data crunchers at Game Discoverer</a> for that). Granted, there is no accounting for statistical shenanigans and even less accounting for bots, sockpuppets, and otherwise false wishlists. But still, it should be a concern that such a blatantly sketchy game is rising through the ranks of curation on Steam as well as being shared more broadly on social media. </p><p>I've asked Valve if they have existing concerns about the game and whether it ought to be allowed on the store. Meanwhile, it looks like Epic Games have already removed the game from sale, its store page now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-57edc7">redirecting to a 404 not found</a>.</p>
<p>As for the creators of the unreleased game, they have posted <a href="https://paradisevs.com/community_info">a lengthy and defensive FAQ</a> on their website which more or less repeatedly hollers "we're doing nothing illegal, promise!" You might expect a GTA-like's FAQ to include stuff like "What guns will I get?" or "How many jet skis can I own?" But for Paradise we get answers to: "Where is your company’s registered legal address?" and "Are there specialists from other countries, including Russia, on your team?" These are questions a player shouldn't have to ask once, never mind <em>frequently</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone-release-period-explained.1074858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Warzone players are screaming out for the return of their first love—Verdansk. The iconic battle royale map birthed friendships, laughs, and intense victories during a difficult time in the world. Verdansk is coming back to Warzone, and its release period is interesting.</p>



<p>“Verdansk” is a stimulus word for many, with CoD smartly priming this feeling many years ago in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beginners-tips-and-tricks-for-winning-big-in-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>. Activision had no right to drop a free-to-play battle royale so compelling. Its smart tactical gameplay was outshined by frantic firefights as you desperately sought cover under the shelter of Stadium’s sunlight-blocking presence. </p>



<p>Verdansk was the source of comfort for frustrated players emotionally bettered by the plight of the world in 2020 and beyond. With Warzone not quite what it once was, it’s time for the fictional city to return to Call of Duty.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone">Is Verdansk Coming Back to Warzone?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s good to be back. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, to be clear, <strong>Verdansk is returning</strong>, and there are no debates or rumors here. Warzone is officially bringing back Verdansk to console CoD, and I’m not talking about Warzone Mobile.</p>



<p>The handheld spin-off marked the first appearance of Verdansk since it was removed. However, Verdansk deserves a bigger stage, and it’s getting one.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-warzone-s-verdansk-release-date">Do we Know Warzone’s Verdansk Release Date?</h2>



<p>There isn’t a precise date, but <strong>Verdansk returns to Warzone sometime in 2025</strong>—we know this is the case as it was confirmed at 2024’s COD NEXT event.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828873802551271432%7Ctwgr%5E78cbc24b0e3ac71fc9db6351227985dd8fa46544%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fverdansk-return-warzone-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD’s official X account</a> echoed the news with a message sure to get the blood pumping, “Run it back. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/">Verdansk will return to Call of Duty Warzone in 2025</a>.”</p>



<p>Before you ask, there aren’t any leaks or general indicators as to when in 2025. It could be midway through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> lifecycle, or Activision can choose to wait until the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025</a> for a joint integration.</p>



<p>We’ll update this when we have an exact release date for Verdansk’s reintroduction.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-verdansk-removed-from-warzone">When Was Verdansk Removed From Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk was removed in December 2021</strong> when it was replaced with the tropical Caldera map for the launch of Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Caldera.</p>



<p>The original Verdansk changed from its debut, from opening up Bunkers to The Destruction of Vedansk—eventually leading to things starting anew with Verdansk ’84. I’m sure we all have our first and last experiences of the legendary map (mine being a win!) and 2025 is ready to hit you in the nostalgia and create new memories and matches.</p>



<hr>



<p>On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you to see Verdansk return? Are you excited to drop into Dam, Train Station, and Superstore? Or will the novelty wear off quicker than a 1v1 in the OG Gulag?

The 1,000th Wordle game was played in early 2024, and it still retains a large audience. Now, the New York Times has revealed which word tripped up millions of Wordle players in 2024.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/new-york-times-top-wordle-connections-2024-rcna185738" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a>, 5.6 million Wordle streaks ended on October 15, 2024. The word chosen for that day was "corer," which can refer to either a knife that's used for coring fruits or a large hollow cylindrical drill/tube that's primarily made for extracting samples of rocks or dirt from the ground or the ocean floor. </p><p>The outcome of that puzzle doesn't seem to have had an adverse affect on Wordle's numbers. The New York Times even debuted a math version of Wordle last year, which is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-york-times-debuts-digits-the-math-version-of-wordle/1100-6513150/" data-ref-id="1100-6513150">Digits</a>. That game invites players to use six numbers or digits to reach a single set number as the final result. Players can choose whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide their numbers as needed as long as the correct result is reached. </p><p>Versions of Wordle were also found in other titles last year including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploding-kittens-creator-launches-wordle-style-word-guessing-game-with-hilarious-visual-clues/1100-6513308/" data-ref-id="1100-6513308">a more humorous take on the game from Exploding Kittens</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a> even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-cleverly-reinvents-wordle-then-squanders-it/1100-6526187/" data-ref-id="1100-6526187">had its own Wordle variant</a>. More recently, a fan-made mod <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-mod-lets-players-use-wordle-to-hack-terminals/1100-6528267/" data-ref-id="1100-6528267">added Wordle to Fallout: New Vegas</a> as an alternative way to hack terminals. It should be fun to see if Wordle will pop up in any other games in 2025.</p>

                <p>Andy Gavin, one of the co-founders of Naughty Dog, has explained why the company sold itself to Sony back in 2001. Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Gavin said he's been asked "countless times" why Naughty Dog took the deal, and it was all about rising development costs.</p><p>Gavin said (<a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/why-naughty-dog-sold-to-sony" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via SI</a>) when Naughty Dog first started making games in the 1980s, game development costs were "manageable," with costs for games made in the early '80s running about $50,000 per game. For 1992's Rings of Power, Naughty Dog spent about $100,000. For the first Crash Bandicoot game, however, costs rose to $1.6 million, with Jak and Daxter (2001) coming in at $15 million or more. Just a few years later, Jak 3's development cost came in at between $45 million and $50 million.</p><p>Naughty Dog was self-funding all of its projects at this time, and the stress about "financing these ballooning budgets independently" became too much to bear. Gavin said rising development costs is a "systemic issue" to this day in the video game industry.</p><p>"Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage," Gavin said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Naughty Dog sold to Sony not just to help secure its financial future, but also to help Naughty Dog make the best games possible "without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralyzing fear that one slip would ruin it all."</p><p>"Looking back, it was the right call. AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then. Today's big-budget games can easily cost $300, $400, or even $500 million to develop," Gavin said. "Would we have been able to keep up? Maybe. But selling--to the right party--gave Naughty Dog the stability it needed to thrive; and to continue making the kinds of games we'd always dreamed of!"</p><p>Gavin left Naughty Dog in 2004, prior to the developer's Uncharted and The Last of Us franchises coming onto the scene. Naughty Dog's other founder, Jason Rubin, is also no longer with the company.</p><p>Gavin isn't the only video game industry veteran to speak about rising costs. Former Sony executive Shawn Layden has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">the AAA video game space is unsustainable due in part to rising development costs.</a></p><p>Naughty Dog is now run by Neil Druckmann, who is president of the company. He is also the writer of Naughty Dog's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Beyond that, Druckmann remains involved with HBO's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-gets-a-narrower-release-window/1100-6528219/" data-ref-id="1100-6528219">The Last of Us TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">potentially The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p>

            <p>An Xbox controller based on the PlayStation 5's DualSense design has been announced by peripheral company Hyperkin.</p>
<p>The upcoming controller - which was announced at CES and is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC - is the company's new 'Competitor' wired gamepad. It features a PS5-style d-pad, symmetrical stick layout, Hall effect joysticks and triggers, and an Xbox button front and centre.</p>
<p>"If you prefer PS5's DualSense controller but want to play something on Xbox or PC, then this is probably going to be the controller for you," reads the official blurb alongside an accompanying trailer for the gamepad. You can check it out below, and no, before you ask like one commenter joked, this is not a parody video and no it is not April Fool's Day.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Hyperkin hasn't shared pricing or a release date for its upcoming controller, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Hyperkin and Xbox have collaborated.

<p>Elsewhere in the news, earlier today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-adds-pc-games-to-rewards-scheme-after-previously-making-it-much-worse">Microsoft announced a revamp of its Rewards with Xbox scheme</a>, which provides points that can be exchanged for store credit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/carmen-sandiego-reboot-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gameloft has revealed the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>reboot, and the game is launching first on Netflix Games for mobile devices, followed by a PC and console launch later this year.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://carmensandiego-game.com/news/carmen-sandiego-launch-date" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>will arrive on Android and iOS via Netflix Games on January 28th, and it'll then launch digitally for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on March 4th.</p>

<p>In addition to the digital launch, a special 40th-anniversary physical edition will also be made available through "Amazon and leading retailers" in late April. Those retailers include GameStop (although perhaps <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures" rel="nofollow">not quite as many stores as we might have hoped</a>), BestBuy, Target, and Walmart.</p>

This will be the first game in the series in which you'll actually play as Carmen herself, too.</p>

<p>Where Carmen was once the head of the criminal organization V.I.L.E., she's now battling that same organization, using her gadgets to track down V.I.L.E. syndicates and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Gameloft is promising "a 3D world with puzzle-solving mechanics, real-world locations, and the classic gameplay of tracking down suspects and solving cases" for&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, further stating that the game will offer a "fresh, immersive experience for both long-time fans and newcomers".</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, which gives a good impression of the game's art style and direction, right here.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>when it launches on mobile devices via Netflix Games on January 28th. It'll then arrive for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475300/Carmen_Sandiego/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012106" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/carmen-sandiego/9N2MZJPCXS6V" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch digitally on March 4th, with the physical version arriving sometime in April.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Step aside Luigi, 2025 is now officially the Year of Eevee. That’s the rather bold claim made today on the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Center UK website</a></span>, and likely to come to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. version later today</a></span>. What does it mean? Well, the TCG is about to launch a new special set of cards called Prismatic Evolutions, all themed around the lil’ brown pup and its octet of evolved forms, with new products released throughout the whole year, and there’s a bunch of new Eevee merch on the store, but could it also be...?</p><p>Rumors of a new Eevee evolution are an ever-present part of <em>Pokémon</em> fandom, with the wee creature not having gained a new mature form since Sylveon (Fairy type) arrived in 2014's Gen VI. Ten years is the longest Eevee’s ever gone without gaining another—the Normal-type Pokémon  began in 1996 being able to turn into Vaporeon (Water), Jolteon (Electric), and Flareon (Fire), then in 1999 gained Espeon (Psychic) and Umbreon (Dark), and then Leafeon (Grass) and Glaceon (Ice) in 2006's Gen IV.</p><p>While the card game has since dropped Fairy types, and never had Ice, the video games have a wealth of potential types that could receive an additional eeveelution. Most obvious, especially given they <em>are</em> in the TCG, are Fighting, Metal/Steel, and Dragon. If these decisions were to ignore the TCG (where it would adopt something close enough, like Glaceon defaulting to another Water type), then there’s still Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, or Ghost. Which is all to say, there’s no reason not to do it!</p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we do already know the full card list from January 17's Prismatic Evolutions special set of the Pokémon TCG</a></span>, given it’s formed from two sources—55 percent of it is reprints from 2024 sets, and the remaining 45 percent comes from Japanese sets Terastal Festival ex and ex Starter Deck Generations. And none of them is a new Eeveelution.</p><p>The set is already providing incredibly popular. Pre-order stock is selling out everywhere, and my attempt to pick up my usual ETB from the Pokémon Center proved impossible—it was sold out literally the moment it appeared on the New Releases page. However, given the set is due to release new products for the entire year, it seems likely this over-excitement will eventually wane.</p><p>What you <em>can</em> buy right now in the UK, and likely later today in the U.S., are a bunch of cute Eevee plushes. Of these, eight are brand new, added to the latest sub-category that’s confusingly not “Sitting Cuties,” rather called “Poké Doll.” There’s an Eevee, and one of each eeveelution (except Flareon?!), and they’re <em>super-</em>cute. Please, someone, stop me from doing something silly. (Also, Flareon? You OK?)</p><p>I’ve made a little gallery of them all, so click next to see all those.</p><p>In the meantime, let’s all wildly over-speculate that this very obvious marketing idea, with its own logo, is actually the beginning of a spectacular announcement of a Dragon-type Eevee to be revealed in this year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. Zulteon. Imagine if I got that right.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount Pictures has announced that the three&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies have crossed a major box office milestone between them.</p>

<p>According to a press release, the franchise has managed to surpass $1 billion in "total box office receipts worldwide", and given that phrasing, it's unlikely Paramount is including any revenue generated by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knuckles-series-release-date" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Knuckles&nbsp;</em>TV show</a> in that figure.</p>

<p>The first two movies constitute $725.2 million of that figure, with $181m in "consumer spending" also being generated by those two movies, although it's not clear whether Paramount is counting that figure as part of the $1b total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-box-office-shadow.jpg?itok=FV4BErv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-box-office-shadow.jpg?itok=GGxTjaEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie, which stars Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog, was released last month.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Paramount,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, the latest installment in the franchise's movie adventures, has earned over $312m around the world, hitting number one at the US box office in its opening weekend.</p>

<p>The studio says that this result puts&nbsp;<em>Sonic 3&nbsp;</em>"83% ahead of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>" on a "like-for-like basis, including previews".&nbsp;<em>Sonic 3&nbsp;</em>also apparently managed to hit $100m at the global box office "more quickly than its predecessors".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with any of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movies, they're all essentially adaptations of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>"mythology", for want of a better word.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-film-coming-to-theaters-next-year" rel="nofollow">the first movie</a> revolved mainly around Sonic himself, the second saw Sonic's longtime sidekick Tails joining the cast, as well as the stoic Knuckles, played by none other than Idris Elba. In the third, we're introduced to brooding antihero Shadow the Hedgehog, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow" rel="nofollow">played by Keanu Reeves</a>.</p>




<p>The three movies also all feature legendary comic actor Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik, alongside a human cast that includes the likes of James Marsden and Krysten Ritter (in the case of the third movie, at least).</p>

<p>Given the success of the existing&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies, it probably won't come as a surprise that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fourth-sonic-hedgehog-movie-2027-report" rel="nofollow">fourth movie is reportedly already in development</a>, with a tentative release window of 2027.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-gave-all-its-employees-a-ps5-pro-as-a-bonus.1074822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up has gifted all of its employees with a PS5 Pro, as well as a cash sum, as part of the studio's end-of-year bonus program.</p>

<p>According to Korean news platform <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/008/0005137533?sid=105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Naver</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-up-has-gifted-all-its-employees-a-ps5-pro-and-3-4k/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), around 300 employees at Shift Up have received their very own PS5 Pro as an end-of-year bonus, as well as 5 million Korean won, which works out at around $3,400.</p>

<p>A Shift Up rep told Naver that the bonuses had been awarded "for the purpose of encouraging talent" (a quote for which we've used machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-shift-up-bonuses-monster.jpg?itok=FtMFXaDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-shift-up-bonuses-monster.jpg?itok=XD3gwNFp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has done so well that Shift Up has granted all of its employees a pretty impressive bonus.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the PS5 Pro <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">retails for around $700</a>&nbsp;(which works out at about 1 million won), these bonuses are not to be sniffed at.</p>

<p>Still,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>managed to shift (no pun intended) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">around a million copies</a> within its first couple of months on release, and although Shift Up hasn't released newer sales figures than that, it seems the game is at least performing well enough to prompt the studio to issue these goodies.</p>

<p>News of Shift Up's end-of-year employee bonuses comes as the studio gears up to release&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>on PC, at least if its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=203&amp;category=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial results</a> are anything to go by.</p>

<p>The PC release of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is apparently planned for sometime this year, and Shift Up expects sales on the platform to "exceed that on consoles". Hey, who knows? Maybe Shift Up employees will get new gaming PCs at the end of this year.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>itself, it's received a number of updates since launching in April this year, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">a&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;and several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">festive outfits</a>.</p>

<p>While Shift Up's attention is doubtless focused on&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>for the near future, the studio has apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">already begun work on its next game</a>, which will, according to the studio itself, be a "cross-platform next-gen project".</p>

<p>It's likely to be some time before we hear more about that, so while we wait, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on PS5</a>. Make sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">read our very own Austin's glowing review</a> if you want more encouragement to pick up the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336355/intel-core-ultra-200-series-hx-h-u-processors-laptops-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is announcing the rest of the Arrow Lake family of CPUs at CES today, with options for thin-and-light laptops all the way up to gaming notebooks. These mobile processors will appear in many of the computers being announced at CES this week, with the 200HX series being paired with next-gen GPUs we’re expecting Nvidia to announce later today and the 200H and 200U series of chips destined for thin-and-light and premium laptops.</p><p>While Intel will continue to supply Lunar Lake CPUs for its range of Copilot Plus laptops, the Arrow Lake mobile family <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu">won’t be ditching memory sticks</a> after Intel confirmed in October that the Lunar Lake chips were a one-off experiment.</p><div><figcaption><em>Intel’s Core Ultra 200HX series of processors.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>The new Core Ultra 200HX series will be targeted at gaming laptops and should deliver around 5 percent better single-thread performance and 20 percent multithread performance improvements over previous Raptor Lake-H Refresh processors. </p><p>Intel says new gaming laptops with the “latest discrete GPUs” (read that as Nvidia’s RTX 50-series) will be coming in late Q1. The flagship Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX has 24 cores (8 performance and 16 efficiency cores), can boost up to 5.5GHz, has 4 GPU cores, and a 13 TOPS NPU. That’s enough to meet Intel’s definition of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112500/microsoft-ai-pc-intel-windows-copilot-key-requirements">AI PC</a>” but not enough for Microsoft’s Copilot Plus features.</p><p>Consumer laptops that aren’t gaming-focused will come with Intel’s 200H or 200U series of processors. The H variants have a base power of 28 watts, apart from the flagship Core Ultra 9 285H that pushes the power requirements up to 45 watts. These H-series CPUs have a new Intel Arc GPU inside that delivers around 15 percent better graphics performance over previous Meteor Lake chips. </p><div><figcaption><em>The Core Ultra 200HX series lineup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>CPU performance on these H chips should be around 15 percent better, too, for single-thread tasks. There are five chips available for laptop makers here, including the flagship Intel Core Ultra 9 285H with 16 cores (6 performance, 8 efficiency, and 2 low-power efficiency cores), a boost clock of 5.4GHz, and 8 GPU cores.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel will also release the U series of its Core Ultra 200 processors for laptops that are much more focused on battery life and thin-and-light designs. These chips have a base power of just 15 watts and only turbo up to 57 watts. The top Intel Core Ultra 7 265U processor includes 12 cores (2 performance, 8 efficiency, and 2 low-power efficiency cores) and can boost up to 5.3GHz.</p><p>While the 200HX series of chips won’t appear until late Q1 in gaming laptops, the 200H and 200U chips should start shipping in thin-and-light laptops in the coming weeks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As of the third quarter of last year, 311 people were working at Shift Up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up had an impressive 2024. The Sony Interactive Entertainment-published Stellar Blade launched exclusively on PS5 in April and sold more than one million copies in two months. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review"><u>Stellar Blade review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.” Since then, Shift Up has continued to update the game and even added crossover DLC with other video game franchises, most notably <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nier-automata"><u>Nier: Automata</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Shift Up raised 435 billion won (around. $320 million) in its first day of trade after an initial public offering. According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-maker-shift-debuts-south-220000910.html?guccounter=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, that was the largest in the country for a gaming company since 2021, when PUBG maker Krafton Inc. raised $3.8 billion from its own IPO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial report, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-coming-to-pc-in-2025-and-the-dev-expects-more-sales-on-steam-than-on-ps5">Shift Up said</a> that after Stellar Blade’s launch “sales continued at a stabilized level,” although it failed to provide an updated sales figure. It did, however, provide revenue directly attributed to the game: 25.8 billion won (approx. $18.5 million) during the quarter Stellar Blade came out (April to June), and 22.5 billion won (approx. $16.1 million) during the company’s third quarter (July to September). That’s a total of 48.4 billion won (around $34.6 million) as of the end of September. For context, Shift Up’s other game, mobile action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/goddess-of-victory-nikke"><u>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</u></a>, makes more money than Stellar Blade (approx. $51.9 million during the same two quarters).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's more to come, too. The developer has confirmed plans to release Stellar Blade on PC in 2025, and pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong"><u>Black Myth: Wukong</u></a>’s incredible success on Steam in predicting more sales on PC than on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up has an unannounced multiplatform game codenamed Project Witches, which it plans to launch after 2027. Given the success of Stellar Blade, it seems likely Shift Up is also considering a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

One of the big questions about Mass Effect 5 is whether its famous Paragon / Renegade morality system will return. Now, the game’s lead developer has teased fans with a cryptic response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, Mass Effect games let you pick from various dialogue options, some of which are on the Paragon (good) side of its morality system, some on the Renegade (bad) side. Not only do your dialogue choices affect the outcome of quests, the main story, and your relationship with the various characters in the game, but the way your Commander Shepard looks. Go all in on Renegade, for example, and your Shepard starts to look evil in a Jedi, dark side of the Force, kind of way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike Gamble, project director of Mass Effect 5 and executive producer at BioWare, took to <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1875259790349451610" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> to discuss the original trilogy’s Paragon / Renegade system following questions from fans about whether or not having all this Renegade content was worth it given most people played Paragon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamble acknowledged most people played Paragon in Mass Effect, but pointed out, “it would have been meaningless if Renegade had not existed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “The ability to choose is stronger than the number of people playing any option, in my opinion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This taps into one of the key appeals of role-playing games: that they react to your choices in meaningful ways whether those choices are good, bad, or ugly. This is something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> does tremendously well. Larian’s RPG contains a huge amount of content most players will never see because their choices take the game in a certain direction, but the experience is all the richer for it. It's also something some BioWare fans critisized Dragon Age: The Veilguard for <em>not</em> doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we come to Mass Effect 5 itself, and one fan’s observation that it is likely to see the return of the Paragon / Renegade system because of hints hidden in a Mass Effect image BioWare released back in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamble’s response: “I was talking about the trilogy. You’ll just have to wait and see…”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I was talking about the trilogy. You’ll just have to wait and see…</p>— Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1875264523017597269?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before we find out. Things have been quiet on Mass Effect ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-n7-day-tease-trailer-andromeda">BioWare revealed a 30-second trailer for Mass Effect 5 on the occasion of N7 Day 2023</a>, leading fans to once again hunt for fresh info.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest revelation was that the long-awaited sequel would indeed tie into Mass Effect: Andromeda in some way. There had been questions about whether BioWare would quietly drop any references to its ill-fated spin-off, but it seems still fully part of the canon, with Mass Effect 5 potentially set long after the events of the original trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Microsoft has doubled down on its plan to invest $80 billion into artificial technologies in 2025, while at the same time admitting that advancements to the technology will lead to job losses. This was always expected to be the case in some sectors, but Microsoft is now coming out and saying it directly.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/03/the-golden-opportunity-for-american-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Microsoft president Brad Smith said, "AI, like all new technologies, will disrupt the economy and displace some jobs." Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">said the same thing</a>. Smith, like Wilson before him, went on to say that, although AI might take some jobs, it will create new ones as well and that the "opportunities" from AI "outweigh many of the challenges ahead."</p><p>"If used well, AI will help lower the barriers to entry for many professions, replace rote tasks, and create a foundation for human creativity that builds on AI tools. AI will create new economic opportunities, allowing entrepreneurs to start new businesses and create new jobs. Along the way, AI can boost productivity in every sector of the economy, adding to the country's opportunity for economic growth," Smith said.</p><p>Microsoft has undergone significant layoffs in recent years, with the Xbox division affected as well. Following the buyout of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">laid off more than 2,500 Xbox employees</a>. Whether or not any of these job cuts were due to AI is unknown. What is evident, though, is that Microsoft's top-down AI push also applies to Xbox. In fact, Microsoft has said AI will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">baked into every product it has, including Xbox. </a></p><p>Microsoft is spending big to help realize these dreams, with Smith noting that Microsoft remains on track to invest about $80 billion to create AI-enabled datacenters to train AI modes and to release AI- and cloud-based software applications globally. Microsoft said "more than half" of this investment will be in the US. Smith said this reflects Microsoft's "commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy."</p><p>Smith went on to say that advancements to AI could become the next major revolution, similar in nature to how the steam engine kicked off the industrial revolution in the 1700s and the manufacturing boom of the 1800s with electricity. In the 1990s, there was a technological revolution with computers and software, and AI could be the next big revolution, Smith said.</p><p>Tim Stuart, the CFO of Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">spoke in 2023 about how he expects AI to impact the future of gaming at Xbox</a>, and he sees a bright future. Like other Xbox executives before him, he did not discuss any potential downsides to AI like job losses or displacement.</p><p>"I've never been more excited for a technology shift in the gaming landscape," he said at the <a href="https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1643204&amp;tp_key=6a9bad458f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wells Fargo TMT Summit</a>. "The last one we did was when we went from discs on consoles to let's call it online games and games-as-a-service; things like Fortnite and Minecraft, which really changed the landscape of how people play. Mobile games being another one. I think AI is one of those inflection points for us."</p><p>For developers, Stuart said studios spend millions of dollars on localization, scripting, and other elements, and he believes, "AI can take care of all of that."</p><p>"You can say, 'Hey I need a player to get from A to B.' And instead of having to write a thousand lines of scripting or code, you just have the AI get you from A to B," Stuart said, adding that AI can help with localization and game testing. AI might also help Microsoft find ways to make even more money, Stuart said. He gave an example of how a game like Minecraft can use AI to learn where players get stuck, but more importantly for the company's bottom line, where they spend money, Stuart said.</p><p>He estimated there are around 100,000 game developers in the world, but with AI, the number of potential game developers could climb into the millions, he said.</p><p>"Anyone in this room can be a game developer. The barista at your local Starbucks has an awesome idea for a game; they can use AI to go create a great mobile experience," Stuart said. He went on to say that some AI-generated mobile games will break through, and others might not, but overall, he expects there to be a new wave of game-creators thanks to AI in the future.</p><p>In other Xbox news, a reliable insider recently said Microsoft will release its next home console, reportedly codenamed Xbox Prime, in 2026, with a <a href="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1876100292959457335?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">handheld coming later.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-minecraft-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markus "Notch" Persson, the original creator of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, says he's "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" after releasing a poll in which he asked his fans what type of game they'd like to see him work on next.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poll</a>, which was posted on social media platform X a few days ago, gave fans two options with regards to Notch's next project: "a traditional roguelike" in the vein of&nbsp;<em>ADOM&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Nethack</em>, or "a spiritual successor thing to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>".</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the poll, which has attracted over 285,000 votes at time of writing, heavily skews towards "<em>Minecraft 2</em>", as he calls it, with 81.5% of votes weighing in for that project and just 18.5% of votes supporting the roguelike concept.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=MWQpjJ3h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=aIleTtcQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Notch can't actually make&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>, since he no longer holds the rights to the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message posted later on</a>, Notch then says he "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" in the poll. Despite feeling that "spiritual successors are usually kind of...tragic", he goes on to say "why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for".</p>

<p>Of course, Notch doesn't actually own the rights to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>anymore (which <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532442637475973" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he himself acknowledges</a>); since Mojang was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mojang-yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft-notch-leaves" rel="nofollow">purchased by Microsoft in 2014</a>, at which point Notch also left the company, it's Microsoft that owns&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, not Notch.</p>

<p>In his post, Notch says he intends to make the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor without "sneakily infring[ing] on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about". He doesn't elaborate on exactly what that means.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Notch doesn't reveal any details whatsoever about this project, so it's likely that we're a long way away from seeing any actual gameplay or even learning any concrete information about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=BVZTQS7r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=x_BYQmIk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>could be getting a "spiritual successor" courtesy of Notch.</figcaption></figure><p>Notch also doesn't sound particularly enthusiastic about making&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>; he's open about knowing it'll make more money than his roguelike idea, but he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874530816216482169" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">implored his supporters</a> to vote for his roguelike project, so that's likely where his heart is (or was).</p>

<p>While the concept of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s original creator making a spiritual successor will be exciting to many, he's not a figure without his fair share of controversy.</p>

<p>He's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-ditches-references-to-notch" rel="nofollow">accused of homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and other prejudices</a> due to his posts on social media, leading to Mojang <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-excluded-from-minecraft-anniversary-for-comments-and-opinions" rel="nofollow">excluding him</a> from&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s tenth anniversary due to his "comments and opinions".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>itself, it's going from strength to strength.</p>

<p>It's still the best-selling game of all time, having <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67105983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hit 300 million sales</a> back in 2023, and a number of tie-in projects are in the works, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments" rel="nofollow">real-life attractions</a>, an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix" rel="nofollow">animated series</a> on Netflix, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">a live-action movie</a>. As far as we're aware, Mojang and Microsoft have no plans for a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2&nbsp;</em>of their own.</p>

            <p>
Original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a> designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player's question about why violence is the "default" path in so many big budget RPGs. That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
His answer to the question isn't very satisfying: violence is the focus at those production scales because games in which bashing, bruising and bloodening are central tend to sell more copies. If you'd like that to change, you must get off your arse and "vote with your dollars". He does, however, have a few interesting reflections about his own experience as an RPG designer attempting to support more creative player approaches, whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-starfield-controversy-is-a-reminder-that-gamers-really-love-pacifism">peacenik</a> or otherwise. Beyond that, the question of why violent games do numbers is always worth chewing over.

<p>
"I've always touted my RPGs as not only not needing violence, not needing you to make a combat character, but I don't even tout that one as the default path - I don't consider combat the main path and stealth and dialogue as the alternatives," Cain comments in the video. "I've always said this game supports multiple paths - you want to talk your way through it, knock yourself out, you want to stealth your way through it, go for it. Even when there's combat that has to be done, usually your companions can do it, or you can use stealth or dialogue to avoid it or reduce it so much that it becomes a relatively trivial fight." 
</p><p>

He points to the existence of easy modes, and more recently, story modes, as ways to sideline the process of decapitating elves and similar, even in games that prioritise violence. But the audience for such things is considerably smaller, he asserts, than the audience for wanton acts of elf murder. "There are options there, but people don't take them as much. People play the non-story modes more often than story modes."
</p>
<p>
Cain himself loves "rarely chosen paths" in RPGs, whether violent or non-violent, and is saddened by what he suggests is the mounting pressure in big budget RPGs to simplify everything to combat. "I put dumb dialogue in a lot of my games," he says. "I like to support generalists or really bizarre specialists, and these are supported in my games." 
</p>
<p>
Even the original Fallout, published in 1997, isn't as violence-led as the "war never changes" branding might indicate, Cain comments in the video. "You would think violence was the default in Fallout, but it really wasn't. People frequently made quests and thought this isn't what the player's going to do, violence is not going to be the go-to in this one."
</p>
<p>
Cain shares a few anecdotes from his play history of "rarely chosen paths": being the first person to complete a 1-INT run of Fallout, playing Arcanum as a swordsman with no magic or technology, and surviving Temple Of Elemental Evil with a party of halfling bards. "A lot of games remove these less common paths and they see little to no reduction in sales, meaning there weren't enough of you who liked those paths," he gloomily observes.
</p><p>
Cain also makes some familiar observations about violent games lending themselves to more impactful trailers, with particular reference to why action RPGs, in his experience, outsell turn-based RPGs and the like. After all, it's "easier to market those kind of games when you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching."
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Cain doesn't really comment at all on the obvious broad question here: why people are drawn to violence in art and entertainment media at large, from the Homeric epics to the latest Netflix horror shows. I have many thoughts, most of them utterly vacuous. One is that depictions of violence tend to involve a subject and object. Considering violence apart from the question of what or who is being violent to who or what risks rendering the whole debate meaningless.
</p>
<p>
Another thought is that violence in video games is perhaps better read as a kind of kinetic, collaborative performance of metaphor and symbol, not the mere sating of a desire to do damage. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-strange-and-bruising-poetry-of-rpg-combat-systems">I've written in the past</a> about how turn-based combat systems remind me of poetic forms in being a cycling set of rules that are used to "compose" an encounter. Combat in such games is often a form of characterisation: party roles like tank, DPS or support correspond to particular narrative archetypes and personalities. 
</p><p>
In shooters, meanwhile, guns are perhaps better interpreted as ways of calibrating the game's spacetime. The range and rate at which they fire, whether they fire in a straight line or an arc, the choice of accompanying light and sound, the size of the clip - all these things are ways of setting the tempo, mapping the space, and determining how you frame and understand other entities. Hand me a slow-loading shotgun and I'll start the level expecting a bunch of blind corners and point-blank quickdraw. I will develop a precise awareness of hand motions, details visible from certain orientations, and the seconds between an enemy looking my way and them noticing me. Hand me an assault rifle and I will tend to perceive enemies as a pleasantly mowable mass.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about violence this way makes me less glum about the undeniable bloodthirstiness of big budget games, from RPGs to open worlders. That said, I would absolutely love to play a "triple-A" RPG that prioritises non-violent methods. For example, a big budget video game adaptation of Alfred Valley's pen-and-paper RPG <a href="https://alfredvalley.itch.io/lay-on-hands">Lay On Hands</a>, which devotes all those triple-yay megabucks to the premise of being a travelling healer. It could still involve violence - can't have a healer without some kind of violence, probably - but it would centre healing as a holistic vocation that extends across dialogue, community interactions and the battlefield. In the meantime, there's Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-play-foxhole-as-a-pacifist-medic-who-refuses-to-carry-a-gun-but-the-enemy-doesnt-seem-impressed">tale of being a pacifist medic in Foxhole</a>.

<p>A new rumor has circulated online that the next-gen Xbox called ‘Xbox Prime’ is targeting a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>The news comes from X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1876099668482085289?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who has a history of posting primarily Call of Duty leaks. According to Hope, he says that he’s heard the next Xbox console “is still coming in 2026 and will be called Xbox Prime.”</p>



<p>He continues to say that it’s unclear if the console’s name is the codename or not and that Infinity Ward’s next Call of Duty title, presumably Modern Warfare 4, will be a Day 1 release.</p>



<p>Hope later continues that the Xbox next-gen release is “pretty much an open secret within the industry.”</p>



<p>If the rumor proves to be true, it could suggest that we could be hearing about the next generation Xbox sooner rather than later, possibly by the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for whether the rumor is true, Hope has had a history of posting Call of Duty leaks and is known to have sources within Activision and Call of Duty development teams, and with the company now owned by Microsoft, it’s entirely plausible that he’s been given the information from a developer working on a next-gen version of Call of Duty 2026. </p>



<p>As Hope points out, hopefully, the rumor leads to others with knowledge of the console speaking out to other leakers or journalists to confirm or deny the rumors.</p>



<p>As of September 2024, the Xbox Series S|X has sold 29.64 million units, half of that of the PlayStation 5’s 60 million.</p>



<p>What do you think of a next-generation Xbox console releasing in 2026? Do you think the next-gen Xbox is called Xbox Prime? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date flings itself onto PC bringing New York’s web-swinging protectors to a new format. The PS5 launch was a summer blockbuster in its own right, but new life is breathing into this sleeping symbiote.</p>



<p>Insomniac Games don’t make bad games. It’s spent 30 years crafting one compelling adventure after another: Spyro, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance. 2018’s Spider-Man elevated the developer’s status to new heights (literally), Miles Morales kickstarted the PS5 generation off in the right way, and 2024’s Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel—pun intended.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 was fortunate enough to get the exclusive launch of the third mainline sequel. However, a Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC release date is looking to kick some criminal butt, and it’s a crime for you to not know the launch date of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-million-copy-selling sequel</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-spider-man-2-pc-release-date">When is Spider-Man 2 PC Release Date?</h2>

<p><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date on PC is locked in for Jan. 30, 2025</strong>, and it is available to purchase from two different storefronts: Epic Games Store and Steam.</p>



<p>Sony users are accustomed to PS4 and PS5 exclusives releasing under a timed window. The early days saw 2018’s God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn eventually get ported to PC, and now most releases follow suit: God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the original Spider-Man, for instance.</p>



<p>Now, it’s the turn of Spider-Man 2 to arrive on PC. 2024’s New York Comic Con fittingly played host to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Release Date announcement</a>. The “Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Announce Trailer” is a chance to revisit some of the open-world title’s most epic battles and emotional, gut-punching scenes, and is sure to whet the appetite of Spidey fans everywhere.</p>

    <div>
                      
                      
          
<p>The pastime of pinball has lived a fraught existence. Whether due to public sentiment, hostile legislation, or a simple lack of popularity, the entire silver ball industry has repeatedly teetered on the brink of collapse. Yet it has always come back, today again riding a wave of popularity driven by the successes of high-tech machines capitalizing on familiar brands like X-Men and Godzilla.</p>
<p>Pinball arcades are springing up everywhere, but private ownership is also surging. Those modern tables with their high-definition displays and brilliant LED lights are getting the most attention, but there is a breed of pinball enthusiast who not only owns a selection of classic machines but also obsessively maintains and restores them.</p>
<p>These collectors have just as much love for the maze of mechanicals beneath the surface as the trajectories the silver ball follows. The goal isn't high scores; it's keeping ornately complex vintage contraptions looking and playing like new.</p>
<p>That's an extreme challenge given some of those pinball machines date back to the 1940s and '50s, games designed to survive in the field for a year or two before being replaced. Keeping them properly flipping, dinging, and buzzing requires a good knowledge of electronics and a passion for troubleshooting—plus access to a dizzying array of specialized parts.</p>
<p>But one man, Steve Young, not only obsessively collects vintage pinball machines himself but has also acquired the dusty stockrooms and manufacturing components from the since-failed brands that built them. Over the past 50 years, he has built the world's greatest collection of rare parts and schematics that keep this detail-obsessed hobby humming. Along the way, he has also developed a unique way of running the business that has become The Pinball Resource.</p>
<h2>Sourcing the Resource</h2>
<p>Young doesn't really advertise these days, and finding his business, The Pinball Resource, is a little bit tricky. Yes, it's on Google Maps, but when you arrive at the building, you'll find just one small sign in a nondescript complex a few miles outside of Poughkeepsie, New York. It's situated between an auto repair shop and a beauty salon.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>When I finally found the entrance, Young told me he intentionally keeps the signage to a minimum. He doesn't exactly want a lot of visitors.</p>
<p>A casual pinball fan might walk in expecting to see a room full of big-budget, licensed pinball machines, maybe a Jaws game sitting next to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/hands-on-with-the-new-john-wick-pinball/">John Wick</a>, wedged in between any of a half-dozen Marvel-themed games, all blinking and blaring in full attract mode.</p>
<p>But The Pinball Resource doesn't have any of that on display. You're greeted by a couple of tired conference tables and endless filing cabinets. Yes, there are a few pinball machines in the next room, but they're half-covered in paper, serving as de facto cutting surfaces for the reprints of schematics and wiring diagrams duplicated by large-format printers.</p>
<p>Those repurposed machines date from the early 1950s, known as "wood rail" machines thanks to their reliance on maple and the like for much of their construction. Though simple by today's standards, the classic designs of these machines have earned them a legion of ardent fans.</p>
<p>"The art is fantastic," Young said, referencing a game called <em>Knock Out</em>, which dates from 1950. The machine depicts a boxing match, but there's far more fighting happening in the crowd, stylized brawls of all sorts. A clown is being led out on a stretcher. Shake the game too much, and a little speech bubble above his head lights up and says, "Tilt!"</p>

<p>This machine dates from the so-called Golden Age of pinball, each game a certified piece of Americana, most designed and manufactured in Chicago. The origin of pinball itself, though, is rather more exotic.</p>
<h2>A brief history of pinball</h2>
<p>For a game that feels refreshingly simple and two-dimensional compared to the latest <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-ps5-pros-biggest-problem-is-that-the-ps5-is-already-very-good/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/xbox-series-x-s-review-beautiful-powerful-but-whatcha-gonna-play/">Xbox Series X</a> releases, pinball has a surprisingly tumultuous history, involving everything from organized crime to Supreme Court rulings.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Its roots date back to an 18th-century single-player form of billiards called bagatelle designed to give bored French nobility something to do when the croquet lawn was too soggy for the delicate heels of their buckle shoes. Players hit balls upward on an inclined table, angling shots to land in pockets and earn points.</p>
<p>That humble game (which also spawned pachinko) evolved into something played behind glass, with players launching silver balls with a spring-loaded plunger, nudging the game to get the balls into holes and earn points. Those holes were framed with pins, giving this odd pastime its eventual name.</p>
<p>By the 1930s, Chicago was the global epicenter of pinball. Games popped up in bars and corner stores across the US, gaining some unwanted attention along the way. Some religious leaders claimed pinball was a source of moral corruption, while some police said pinball was part of organized crime rings. It was banned or restricted in many municipalities. New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia's goons dragged hundreds of games out of businesses and smashed them in the streets in the 1940s, creating a sea of broken glass and shattered wood not seen since the prohibition's frothier demolitions a decade earlier.</p>
<p>Despite all that, pinball survived. Manufacturers implemented rule changes to stay within the law, but things really took off after a game called <em>Humpty Dumpty </em>in 1947 made a minor addition that changed everything: the flipper. Chance and skill were now more evenly balanced, and the game's popularity exploded again.</p>
<p>But it still was a game lingering under a shadow of dubious legality. It wasn't until 1976, when pinball guru Roger Sharpe famously called a shot on a machine set up in a New York state courtroom, that pinball was officially designated a game of skill, not chance. This led to most of the restrictions across the country falling. The game entered another wave of popularity, setting the stage for a new generation of machines using modern, solid-state electronics.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It was about this time that something else began: The Pinball Resource.</p>

<h2>Becoming The Resource</h2>
<p>Young's obsession with pinball dates back to the early '70s, when he was a college student at Lehigh University studying metallurgical engineering, a discipline that would eventually lead to a career at IBM. He and his friends became fascinated by the game.</p>
<p>"Being a bunch of engineers and math people and so forth, we got our fingers in there, and if we couldn't fix something, the tech came, and we'd watch him and learn from him," he said.</p>
<p>Eventually, Young and a friend began operating multiple machines, called "running a route" in the industry. "We had, like, 26 games out on campus at Lehigh. So, to maintain that, you've got to have parts." As Young's personal and professional pinball collections grew, so did his collection of parts, which he eventually started selling to others.</p>
<p>"By the time I graduated college, I had probably 30 or 40 games of my own outside of the games we were operating, and then I needed to maintain and fix those. And I kind of just stumbled into doing that, and I started advertising in some of the early magazines," Young said.</p>
<p>He took out an ad in Pinball Trader Newsletter, the biggest publication for the hobby at the time. The magazine's editor, Dennis Dodel, dubbed Young "The Pinball Resource."</p>
<p>"The name stuck," Young said.</p>
<h2>Beneath the glass</h2>
<p>If there's one thing you need to know about pinball machines, it's that they break—a lot. You'd never know it, thanks to the surprisingly effective sound-deadening properties of the glass under which it's played, but a game of pinball is shockingly violent. Each 80-gram silver ball gains remarkable inertia as it catapults from one target to another.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Remove the glass, fire up a game, and you'll quickly be reaching for some hearing protection. It's unpleasant, but playing like this is a good way to appreciate how much of a pounding a pinball machine takes every time you pull that plunger.</p>
<p>Factor into that hundreds of incandescent bulbs slowly baking all the machine's internals, plus grit and debris accumulating in every mechanism as the machine wears, and you have a recipe for something that needs a lot of attention to keep operating.</p>
<p>That violence made for short-lived games. "If you go back in the '50s, I think those games were designed for maybe 18 months on location, then they got traded back in," Young said. "Most big operators expected two or three years out of a game. Factories only supported them for five years."</p>
<p>Where modern, solid-state machines rely on software flashed to embedded systems, running on SoCs smaller than your thumbnail, earlier machines feature a far more convoluted set of mechanisms. These machines, called electromechanical (EM), instead rely on a series of discs and circuits to control the game's logic.</p>
<p>"This is like programming for electromechanical," Young said. "It's like programming a ROM, right? This is what made the game work the way it was supposed to work."</p>

<p>As the player progresses through the game, electric motors turn these wheels from one position to the next, advancing through different rules and bonuses.</p>
<p>Special when lit? Not if the wheel that controls that aspect of the game is missing or broken. But which discs go where, and in what orientation? Each game is a complex logic puzzle of circuits, switches, and relays, all connected through a wiring harness dizzying enough to make a rat seek shelter elsewhere.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Knowing how everything goes together requires extensive documentation and plenty of experience. Over the years, Young has gathered an unprecedented collection of both.</p>
<h2>Keeping hope alive</h2>
<p>Gottlieb is the most historically significant brand in pinball. This is the company that introduced the flipper in 1947 and kept making games through to the mid-'90s. It survived the big pinball downturn in the early '80s brought on by the arrival of arcade video games, but it couldn't weather the next drought.</p>
<p>"There's a cycle of pinball. It's like a seven-year cycle, ups and downs and so forth," Young said. "Peak might have been about 1992 if you look at the number of games produced. It was like 120,000 games." But, from there, Young said, it was a steady decline of roughly 10 percent per year.</p>
<p>"Gottlieb closed in '95, and they moved the parts to their distributorship in New Jersey, with the idea of setting up a parts department," Young said. But, the company quickly changed its mind.</p>
<p>Young eventually bought out Gottlieb's backlog of parts and numerous pieces of manufacturing equipment, operating a revenue share with the company for a time before taking outright control of the inventory. That's how The Pinball Resource became the de facto source for all things Gottlieb, but it wouldn't end there.</p>
<p>"We've picked up all these pieces as the pinball business has shrunk and fallen apart," Young said. "I sat down once with a yellow pad, and I started writing down the number of distributors that I bought their stock, right? And I filled the side of the page and turned the page over before I got done."</p>
<p>Along with the truckloads of parts and specialized equipment have also come stacks and stacks of schematics for all these machines, some bearing hand-drawn corrections penned by long-retired engineers. They all lie stacked and ordered in a series of wide cabinets.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>"This is probably one of the world's largest collections of schematics," Young said. "Every Gottlieb schematic in the world is in that filing cabinet." Schematics from other manufacturers sit nearby, along with endless manuals covering games from many brands and eras. I told him that the 1986 Williams machine <em>High Speed</em> was my favorite. Ten seconds later, he had the original manual in hand.</p>
<p>These manuals tell you which components you need if your machine isn't working, but a part number someone scrawled onto a sheet of draft paper in 1953 won't do you much good if that part went out of production sometime during the Eisenhower administration.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Young has you covered there, too. The Pinball Resource didn't just buy the parts from Gottlieb and others but also used numerous pieces in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Young took me into the storage and manufacturing area within The Pinball Resource, featuring shelf after shelf of parts plus tables covered with specialized machines.</p>
<p>"I have a lot of tooling set up over the world," he said. Rubber rings are a perpetual consumable in pinball machines. The little bumpers that cushion impacts take a beating. The Pinball Resource manufactures its own rings in Taiwan, using tooling acquired from yet another company's bankruptcy. Other parts are manufactured at a facility in pinball's traditional home of Chicago.</p>
<p>One item the company assembles at the company's New York headquarters is called a pop bumper cap, the colorful mushroom-shaped dome that covers the circular bumpers often found in clusters of threes on pinball playfields. There's an endless variety of colors and designs, many featuring custom embossed logos.</p>
<p>Creating these requires a specialized press that drives a heated brass stamp to create the logo, a process called hot stamping. Young has hundreds of these stamps to emboss everything from the American flag to Medusa's head. Some are decades-old originals. Others are modern reproductions he's sourced from artists, each costing upward of $500 to create. Young sells the caps they produce for $5 or $6 each.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Mechanical components receive just as much attention, including presses and punches to create the endless shapes and sizes of electronic switches required to ensure a machine accurately keeps score.</p>
<p>And then there's the coils. Pinball machines rely on small coils of wound copper wire, electromagnets that eject a plunger that pushes or pulls a mechanism to send the silver ball flying in a new direction. Young buys thousands of pounds of copper wire to wind custom coils in numerous sizes, even coming up with custom high-power models to make slow old games faster.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they're too fast. "I have a regular pop bumper coil, and I have a 'hot' pop bumper coil, and the hot one is <i>too</i> hot, okay? So, I'm trying to hone in on what a medium should be," Young said. "Everybody likes a medium, right? So I really want a little warmer pop bumper coil, but not a <i>hot</i> one. I don't want the lights to dim when the bumper pulls in."</p>
<p>Young also refines and improves upon original pinball parts known for failing early and often, subtly adding thickness or reinforcement to ensure that stressed components better survive the rigors of gameplay. "We try to make the part authentic to the original part, or better," he said. "You make the part, you might as well make the part right."</p>
<p>Improvements like these are thanks not only to Young's metallurgical background in the field but also thanks to the feedback he gets courtesy of the uniquely hands-on approach he takes to dealing with customers.</p>

<h2>Check, please</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pbresource.com/">The Pinball Resource's website</a> has a delightfully retro 1990s feel about it. Click your way through, and you'll find an endless list of parts and accessories in simple tables. What you won't find, though, is a "Buy it Now" button anywhere.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>How do you order anything then? Well, you send an email or pick up the phone. Either way, don't be surprised if you hear from Young himself.</p>
<p>"I almost always call in my orders and talk to Steve. It's always informative and interesting. I'll only email an order for mundane supplies," Dave Golden told me. He's a Massachusetts-based pinball enthusiast who not only keeps busy maintaining his own collection of about 30 games but volunteers his time fixing machines at the ElectroMagnetic Pinball Museum in Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Golden estimates he's spent a couple of thousand dollars at The Pinball Resource since his first order in 2018, but plenty of Young's customers spend a lot more.</p>
<p>People like Levi Nayman, who runs <a href="http://www.crazylevipinball.com/">Crazy Levi's Pinball</a>, which restores and sells pinball machines in the metro New York area. He's been a Pinball Resource customer for over 20 years and has lost track of how much he's spent there buying hard-to-find parts. "I really have no idea, probably over $10k but it's not anything I've kept track of," he said.</p>
<p>What keeps Levi coming back? Steve Young. "He's got the stuff, the knowledge, and the personality," he said. "I also get my stuff overnight since it's so close."</p>
<p>Young fields questions from customers like Nayman every day, often firing a question or two right back at them.</p>
<p>Questions like: "Wait, what are you trying to do?"</p>
<p>With a complex system like a pinball machine, sometimes a misfiring coil or a flickering bulb can have a cause that's only tangentially related to the symptom. And so, Young frequently finds himself talking people out of ordering parts they don't need.</p>
<p>"I can't be comfortable taking people's money from lack of knowledge," he said. "I've had to be careful how I can do that because people take offense. 'You won't sell me that? What's the matter?' You know? 'Well, you really don't need it. Do this first.'"</p>

<p>Regardless of which parts you order, you'll of course need to pay for them, and that leads to the final unusual aspect of The Pinball Resource's business model.</p>
<p>"I don't do credit cards. We don't do PayPal," Young said. Venmo, Zelle, and other digital forms of payment also rank on the no-fly list. Young takes checks, money orders, wire transfers, cash, and that's about it. These forms of payment can be slow, but orders don't wait: The Pinball Resource ships most orders before payment is received.</p>
<p>Young likens it to a sit-down restaurant, something that confuses a lot of new customers. "When you place your order, do you have to pay? Or, do you eat the meal first, and then they give you your check, and then you pay?" Young said. "People really appreciate the trust I place in them."</p>
<p>That attitude has earned The Pinball Resource a perfect five-star rating in online reviews from Google to Yelp, plus legions of loyal customers worldwide, each with a shared passion for keeping machines once considered disposable alive for the next generation to enjoy.</p>
<p>And that's what Young is dedicated to doing himself, though lately on a somewhat reduced scale. He's pared his personal collection of games down from over 200 to about 70. "I'm really focused on wood rails, so that kind of ends at 1960. And the more I work on them, the more my attention really narrows in on the span from maybe 1951 to '54 as being the creme de la creme in terms of play and artwork."</p>
<p>There's some interesting irony that a man who came into this hobby through a study of metallurgy prefers games known for their wooden construction, but in the intervening 50 years, Young has helped maintain countless machines of all generations. Given that, I asked him what advice he'd give anyone who's just bought their first machine, that one special game that somehow captured their imagination. I expected a suggestion about online user groups or specific tools worth investing in.</p>
<p>His response was a little different: "Don't turn your back on them," he said. "They multiply when you're not looking."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has topped another major sales milestone, so it looks like the game is selling solidly.</p>

<p>Back in October, Capcom revealed that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">broken the eight million sales barrier</a>, and now, according to <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new post</a> on social media platform X, the game has topped nine million sales.</p>

<p>That means that in the intervening months,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>notched up another million sales or so for itself. To celebrate this latest milestone, Capcom also posted a new piece of artwork that depicts many of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s characters enjoying a surprisingly civil meal together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=NeovxWmN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=IwStviWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s sales milestones are growing increasingly impressive.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that it took&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240313.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around six or seven months</a> to amass the million sales needed to take it from seven to eight million, this latest milestone is perhaps even more impressive than previous achievements, too.</p>

<p>The remake was originally released in March 2023, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days" rel="nofollow">racking up three million sales</a> in the two days following its launch and swiftly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-4-million-mercenaries-mode-now-available" rel="nofollow">reaching four million</a> within just a couple of weeks. The game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-reach-5-million-capcom-announces" rel="nofollow">hit five million sales</a> by July that year.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the influential 2005 action-horror classic, which sees Leon Kennedy descending into a European village in order to rescue Ashley Graham, the US president's daughter, from a sinister cult.</p>

<p>The remake introduces a number of changes and additional elements to the original, including new exploration areas, revamped gameplay that more closely resembles the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>remakes, and more.</p>




<p>Our very own Sam gave&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake an impressive score of 9.5 in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, praising its "fantastic" gameplay improvements and "beautiful" visuals, among other things.</p>

            <p>The baggiest thing about PS1-harkening <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tyrants-realm">Tyrant’s Realm</a> is the ratty pair of prisoner pants you start out with. Everything else is pleasingly austere. It is, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.</p>

<p>There are a few fancy moves. There’s a parry you’ll never use because it’s too risky, and an execution you can build up a meter for, then trigger the moment an enemy is stunned following the parry you’ll never use. There’s some weapon-arty bits: very slowly applying poison to your sword and getting your face smashed in in the process. A large overhead axe swing, using an axe that appears from nowhere while you’re holding a club. The poison is especially good and PS1-faithful because the target flashes green and goes ‘ugh’ in periodic blips afterward. This stands out as nicely juddery and violent because the action is very smooth otherwise.</p>
<p>But I was mainly drawn to Tyrant’s Realm’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2259260/Tyrants_Realm/">prelude demo</a>’s Steam page’s download button because it looked a bit like Deathtrap Dungeon - the 1998 action adventure based on the Fighting Fantasy CYOA of the same name. I am fairly certain top Soulsboi Miyazaki has mentioned it as an influence, which is a nice bit of continuity, but it's a connection I make here simply for the low fantasy spikeyness and grime of it all. One of the less common uses for PS1 visual aesthetics, that, at least behind retrowave racers and horror games. More spikes, I say. It’s out on the 16th of January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest 2025 will be held in Paris in June, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go's biggest annual in-person event will kick off in Osaka, Japan from 29th May to 1st June, before a weekend in Jersey City, New Jersey from 6th to 8th June.
</p>
<p>
Paris will then become the latest capital city to host the event's annual European leg from 13th to 15th June. Previous years have seen the event held in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Madrid</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-joys-of-pokemon-go-fest-london">London</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-returns-in-person-after-three-years">Berlin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Full details of the event remain under wraps, as Pokémon Go is still to hold its big spring gathering, Go Tour: Unova, at the beginning of March. Still, for those looking to book travel now, you can now put those summer dates in your diary. 
</p>
<p>
Go Fest typically attracts hundreds of thousands of players to its three live event locations, before a global event is held for all Pokémon Go players. There are no details yet on exactly when that will be. 
</p>
<p>
Last weekend, Pokémon Go began 2025 with its first Community Day - though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-monthly-community-day-ticket-doubles-in-price">regular event's optional ticket price has now doubled</a>.

            <p>There is not long to go until you can rev your engines once more with an all new Tokyo Xtreme Racer game.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which will mark the first series title in 18 years - will make its Steam early access debut later this month, on 23rd January. Developer Genki said it will use this early access stint to "utilise player feedback to elevate the game even further".</p>
<p>Early access is expected to last for around four months. Then, of course, the full release will launch. This version will include the remainder of the story, along with additional cars, additional rival characters, and "new features and improvements". Genki added those who plump for the early access version will have access to the full release version upon launch, at the discounted early access price (for now, that price is "TBA", so stay tuned). </p>

			<p>The elevator pitch for Skydance’s Behemoth promises you one thing: huge battles against behemoths. Enemies the size of skyscrapers that you have to dodge, climb, and eventually stab in just the right spot to bring down. It’s Shadow of the Colossus except in VR, with you doing the actual climbing motions yourself. It sounds like a perfect fit, and fighting them is as entertaining as you’d expect… except you only get to get to do so a handful of times. The rest of the game has you&nbsp;fighting human enemies, exploring levels, and solving puzzles, which is a bit less exciting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's Behemoth - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLjFsZAHuJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’ve played a combat focused VR game before, you’ll have an idea of what to expect from the person to person combat – scabbards on each hip and shoulder allow you to carry and switch between a variety of weapons ranging from standard swords, axes, shields, and bows through to giant, Cloud Strife-sized swords and yet another sword that can be re-summoned after throwing. Make no mistake, you are a very dangerous person in this game and that’s before you take into account the powers that you’ll quickly acquire, such as super strength that, when activated, lets you pick up whole enemies and throw them around, punch through damaged walls, and more.</p>


<p>Clearly the game gives you a lot of tools and you will use them in conjunction with a parry/riposte system to fight your way through levels in search of the behemoth. There’s more than enemies to contend with though, as there’s also the dreaded stamina bar-based climbing which, provided you glance at what you need to do first and keep the pace up, isn’t really an issue. You’ll also quickly find a wrist mounted grappling hook that allows you to pull, swing, and zip up to things, not to mention pulling enemies towards you during combat. It doesn’t take long before you’re doing typical platformer things like grappling between points without landing. Except in VR!</p>


<p>The only problem is that it’s all a bit too easy. The puzzles in particular are very simplistic and feel especially laborious when you’re the actual person dragging giant blocks around. The combat is a bit easy as well, only really raising its difficulty when you reach a boss, whether that’s a beefed up human or behemoth. It doesn’t bother you too much whilst you’re playing, because the moment-to-moment fighting is so much fun, but after a battle it tends to feel like it was over too quickly. Even the enemies with lengthy health bars are a bit too easy once you’ve got a handle on the parry system. Then it’s just a case of working down their health until their helmet pops off so you can stab them in the face. Lovely.</p>
<p>I do enjoy the staging of things throughout – one battle with an archer boss had arrows hit a save point as you’re using it, with a dramatic pause waiting for you to turn around to continue the encounter. It feels like the kind of melodrama you expect in medieval fantasy. Outside of moments like this the story itself isn’t particularly engrossing, but it’s good enough to keep you going at least and the voice acting sells it well enough.</p>

<p>Now we come to the behemoths. Yep, they’re actually that big and they look even bigger in VR, especially when you’re clinging to their ankles. These go too far the other way in terms of difficulty, and I found that there was a bit of trial and error involved in defeating them – obviously error means death. Sometimes it took a while before I noticed a weak point or climbable part, which makes you feel like an idiot when really, you just couldn’t see it from where you were or it wasn’t shining like usual for some reason. Outside of this, though, they’re thrilling. The build up to the behemoths is good as well – one of my favourite moments comes in the run up to the second behemoth, a large bat like creature. It’s hanging in front of you silhouetted so you don’t notice it in the environment until it unfurls its wings and roars before flying upwards through the cavern you’re entering. It’s just great.</p>
<p>The game runs flawlessly on PSVR 2 and looks good, if not great. It controls well enough most of the time, though there can be a bit of awkwardness around sheathing weapons as is typical in VR. Activating the super strength is a bit inconsistent as well – sometimes I thought I had done it but it hadn’t triggered for some reason and others it wouldn’t register me hitting a wall with it activated, which caused it to run out and forced me to wait for the cooldown. I also found that aiming with a bow would sometimes cause the bow to wiggle slightly with the hand tracking, which isn’t great for aiming really.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ultimately Behemoth is a good VR combat game that's a bit too easy, and with its impressively huge boss battles too few in number. Whilst the combat and exploration is enjoyable enough, the puzzling is too simple and, in a game about killing giants, you'd expect there to be a few more giants.	</p></div>
