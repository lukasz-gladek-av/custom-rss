            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>developer Iron Gate Studios has announced that its Viking survival game is heading to PlayStation 5 sometime next year, and what's more, it'll fully support crossplay as well.</p>

<p>This news was revealed in <a href="https://valheim.com/news/valheim-is-coming-to-playstation-/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the game's official website, where Iron Gate also announces that it's collaborating with support studio Piktiv (which also helped out with the PC Game Pass and Microsoft Store versions of the game) for the PS5 release.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Iron Gate doesn't disclose a release date for the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, but the studio does say that Piktiv's work will allow it to "continue to focus on developing the Deep North and 1.0", so perhaps the PlayStation 5 launch will coincide with one of those updates.</p>

It brought numerous changes to combat and Forsaken Powers, as well as new trinkets, new creatures, and more.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafter set in the titular Norse realm, which is an invention created specifically for the game. Together with your friends (or solo if you dare), you must prove to Odin that you're fit to join him in the halls of Valhalla.</p>

<p>To do so, you'll need to carve out a life for yourself in the realm of Valheim, slaying its various denizens and surviving by gathering the resources you find across its varied biomes. You'll be crafting weapons, exploring the world around you, and taking advantage of the game's "flexible building system" to construct bases.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/valheim-game-preview/9ncbl78cg9n7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also available as part of a Game Pass subscription. The game is due to land on PS5 sometime next year.</p>

            <p>Be very, very quiet. Yes, I know this is being yelled from a page on a video game website that at least five people have heard of, so it's hardly hush-hush, but if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">Randy keeps shouting unhinged things at people about PC specs</a>, I think we might slip under the radar.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> build. It's a bit broken, and can reportedly down bosses in a click of your fingers by doing a craptonne of damage. I am telling you this information now. The game's director is aware of the quirk at the heart of this slapping-up setup, and I've a sneaking suspicion it might be tweaked soon.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The build in question, as you'd expect for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, involves knives. Vex's knives, to be exact. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/nothing-is-safe-from-borderlands-4s-infinite-damage-build-that-wipes-out-bosses-in-less-than-10-seconds/">Percival Celebration Gamer</a> and shown off by TuYouber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5FuLSM6CgM">NickTew</a>, it's possible to set up the Siren in a fashion that can one-shot bosses even at higher difficulty levels.</p>
<p>You'll need a Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator augment. They're pretty rare, so you may need to rummage through your cupboards. The domino that kicks off the chain is you lobbing that at the enemy before you do anything else. Next, let me introduce you to Vex. She's got a couple of handy passive skills - Bloodletter and Contamination. The former means her gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply a bleed effect, which combines with the knife here to make each tick of bleed do critical damage.</p><p>On top of that, Contamination kicks in to make critical hits increase your chance of status effect application to 100%. Cue bleed damage causing <em>more</em> bleeds to spring up on the poor enemy, and you have numbers that'll keep going until your foe keels over, probably while mumbling something about you being a tryhard.</p>
<p>It worth noting that according to NickTew, the knife doesn't appear to work this way if you're playing co-op and more than one person lobs one, seemingly because the two sets of bleeds caused "will overwrite each other".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Chill guys, we're not going to knee jerk react to anything. That said, this looks like a bug we fixed with Harlow and Rafa prior to launch that could recursively cause damage it and actually crashed the game and/or froze the UI. Going to investigate, could be legit stability prob</p>— Graeme Timmins (@ProdigyXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProdigyXL/status/1967365352763088926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The hangup with this build, aside from the rareness of the knife, is that it looks likely to be patched out or significantly nerfed soon. Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1967299997558587410">replied to a tweet</a> about Vex's bleed being a bit too powerful the other day. He was quick to declare that the studio are "not going to knee jerk react to anything", but did add that this looks similar to a bug that afflicted fellow Vault Hunters Harlow and Rafa prior to release. That one "actually crashed the game and/or froze the UI", so the devs are investigating to see if there are any stability issues being caused by Vex's potent phlebotomy.</p>
<p>Oh no, I think Randy heard me type stability issues! You'd better scurry off before he infiltrates the treehouse and shouts something about the futility of trying to run his game on a toaster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Split Protective Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ec9c5197beea8/split-protective-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you managed to check out our review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Genki’s Attack Vector Case</a> for the Switch 2, then JSAUX’s <strong>Split Protection Case</strong> will look pretty familiar.</p>
<p>It adopts the same modular approach, with a main case clipping onto the back of the device, and two grips encompassing the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The difference here, however, is that JSAUX’s product comes with a fourth additional case that clips onto the front of the Switch 2, enclosing the entire device and thus theoretically providing decent protection while traveling.</p>
<p>Every segment included is easy to apply. The Joy-Con cases snap on from the outer sides, the back panel clips onto the top and bottom edges of the main console, and the front panel folds over the shoulder buttons before clipping onto the bottom. Interestingly, you can’t just use the front panel on its own; you have to have the back on first, otherwise there’s simply not enough material for the front panel to clip on to.</p>

<p>What’s nice is that, like the Genki case, the modular design lets you remove the Joy-Con controllers from the console with the casing clipped on, and the back panel is also slim enough to dock the Switch 2 as normal. There is a slight catch with this, though.</p>
<p>JSAUX warns about a noise that occurs when docking the Switch with the back panel attached. It says this is normal, and it probably is, but as someone who looks after their gadgets to an almost obsessive degree, this ‘normal noise’ – which is basically a dull clicking sound – makes my skin crawl. As such, I’ve opted to remove the back panel when docking the console.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con grips are lovely, though. Although lacking in any kind of rubber grips, there is a rough texture applied to the exterior, and it feels pretty nice. The closest comparison is the slight texture applied to the official Xbox controllers, although it’s perhaps slightly more apparent on the JSAUX grips. Meanwhile, their shape hug your palms nicely, so it makes gaming in handheld mode considerably more comfortable.</p>

<p>My main issue with the Split Protector is with the front panel. When it’s actually attached to the console along with the rest of the casing, you really get a sense that the Switch 2 is well protected. That said, I’m not wholly convinced that it can provide adequate protection beyond a few scrapes and scratches. Since it clips onto the Switch 2 without much force, I can easily imagine it flying off again if you happen to drop your system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interior of the front panel contains slots in which to store your physical cartridges. They feel pretty secure when they’re inserted, and I feel confident that they’re not going anywhere, but I’m also conscious that the front panel is completely loose when removed from the device.You could say the same about any case, I suppose, but if you’re out and about and you remove the front panel – which may have up to ten cartridges stored within – that’s a <em>heck</em> of a lot to lose if you happen to misplace it or some heathen nicks it.</p>
<p>Call me paranoid, but having the cartridges on full show with nothing to conceal them makes me really nervous, and I think it would have been beneficial to be able to clip the front panel onto the back when in use, or at least include some way of hiding your cartridges once the panel is removed. As it is, I’m not fully prepared to take this thing on the road, and for true protection, I’d probably just opt for a more traditional case.</p>

			<p>Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> leaves much to be desired in terms of optimization, with the right settings, it is possible to achieve noticeable performance improvements on multiple GPUs with minimal impact on the visuals.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, MxBenchmarkPC compares how the new entry in the series by Gearbox runs and looks at various resolutions on multiple GPUs ranging from the RTX 5080 and 4080 to the dated RTX 3080 and 3060 GPUs using both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR with and without Frame Generation, highlighting how the used optimized setting don't look much different from the Very High settings preset and deliver much better performance, up to 40% in some scenarios.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Borderlands 4 Optimization - Up to 40% More FPS | RTX 5080, 5070, 4080, 4070, 4060, 3080, 3060" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HMAPk0Zmc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><em>Optimized Settings:<br>HLOD Loading Range: Far<br>Geometry Quality: High<br>Texture Quality: Very High (12GB), High (10GB), Medium (8GB)<br>Anisotropic Filtering Quality: x16<br>Foliage Density: High<br>Volumetric Fog: Medium<br>Volumetric Cloud: Medium<br>Shadow Quality: High<br>Directional Shadow Quality: High<br>Volumetric Cloud Shadows: Disabled<br>Lighting Quality: High<br>Reflections Quality: Medium<br>Shading Quality: Medium</em></p>



<p>Right at launch, it was clear how Borderlands 4 is among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/">most demanding games to run released this year</a>, and although it has already been patched with some performance and stability improvements, there's still a lot of work left to be done. The game's performance has prompted a heated discussion between users disappointed by how the game runs on their systems and Gearbox co-founder Randy Pitchford, who suggested that "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">4K stubborn" players</a> who don't have the hardware to play at that resolution should switch to 1440p resolution or take advantage of NVIDIA DLSS or other upscalers to achieve better performance. The discussion got so heated that Pitchford replied to one user telling the studio to make a game look good without AI upscale to <em>"code their own engine"</em> and show them how it's done.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

						<h5>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji</h5><p><span>September 16, 2025</span>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is hardly going to be remembered as the finest entry in the series or the best open-world game set in Feudal Japan, but the good the game does definitely outweighs the bad, making for an enjoyable experience whose real fault lies in the series' now trademark content bloat and the by-the-book open-world ARPG experience rather than in the bad execution of any of its features.</p>



<p>Coming only a few months after the base game, no one should have expected the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji expansion to address any of the issues of the base game, and it doesn't, indeed. If anything, it makes abundantly clear how the quantity over quality approach behind the series is what is holding it back the most, as the good the expansion does is heavily diluted by quest and world design aimed at expanding the total playtime without actually offering anything interesting.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji begins rather well with one of the most unique quests in the entire game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji is an endgame expansion and, as such, can only be accessed after the main story and the personal quests of Naoe, Yasuke and Junjiro have been completed. There's a story justification for this, as the expansion is centered around the recovery of the last regalia on Awaji Island and a brief war against Kimura Yukari, the daughter of the Templar Kimura Kei whom Yasuke already dealt with. After a short first quest that does an excellent job introducing the current state of Awaji Island in a believable Japanese way, Naoe and Yasuke travel to the island to save Naoe's mother, Tsuyu, recover the regalia, and put an end to yet another Templar in Japan.</p>



<p>Being around 5 hours long, the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji story isn't particularly deep, but it's entertaining enough with some high points at the beginning and the end. The new characters around which the main quest is centered aren't well developed and fall in line with everything seen in the base game. Some are despicable individuals, no matter the angle; others fall more into a grey moral area where they are duty and honor-bound to serve the Templar lady, but none of their motivations are fully explored, making them nothing more than a device to move the story toward its conclusion. To be honest, no character or event in the expansion is bad to the point of being offensive, but they are so unremarkable that I would be surprised if anyone remembered much a few hours after completing the story.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji's story has some highlights but is mostly unremarkable.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In my opinion, unremarkable is also the most apt description of Awaji Island and everything in it. Thanks to the technical improvements introduced in the Anvil Engine, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands as one beautiful open-world game with some standout locations, but the new island is definitely not going to be among them, as there is nothing in it that truly stands apart, as the entire new map, which is also rather small, seems to be some sort of rearranging of visual elements lifted from the base game. The actual design of the map also leaves something to be desired, as it is very predictable and features some areas in different parts that are almost identical. Also, at launch, Awaji Island is not as polished as the base game was, as I have encountered a good number of visual glitches that were hard to miss, including a glitch in the wind system which made leaves on the ground scatter as if there was an explosion beneath them. Nothing truly gamebreaking, but their frequency was definitely immersion breaking.</p>



<p>With an unremarkable story and map, it should be no surprise that Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji disappoints even in terms of content. This is where it's clear how going for quality over quantity may have helped a lot, as the best additions to the experience are really well done, such as the new Bo weapon for Naoe. This versatile weapon comes with tons of pretty useful skills, including one that can heal her with timed button presses, and a stance system that makes Naoe much better at fighting enemies head-on with options to push back, stagger, and knock down enemies. Yasuke, on the other hand, doesn't get any new weapon, but new skills for all of his weapon types that work quite well against a group of enemies, making them a welcome addition. Though not a gameplay addition, the entire questline focused on Nowaki, one of the central figures in the Sanzoku Ippa faction that dominates the island, is the highlight of the expansion, ending with a stealth-focused boss battle that reminded me of the boss fight against The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Bo weapon for Naoe is one of the best additions in Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the above are the only highlights of the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji expansion. The rest of the content is recycled from the base game, with a mix of stealth and combat-focused quests that do nothing different. In some instances, this recycled content is even worse than the base game's content due to design decisions clearly motivated by the intent to extend playtime. Many quests, for example, begin at one of the ends of the island and continue to the opposite end. Without a fast travel point, the journey can take a few minutes which are as unremarkable as most of the time in the expansion, as the island's design is nothing to write home about, as already mentioned, the side activities are either the same seen in the base game, like drawing Sumi-e for Junjiro and the Kuji-kiri meditation points or strongholds and camps to clear, or slightly altered versions that don't add much. The decision to make the Sanzoku Ippa a very aggressive faction that is constantly on the hunt for Naoe and Yasuke is a nice touch that adds a bit of tension to potentially dull traversal, but at times, they are so aggressive that constantly getting sniped by a rifleman hidden in a bush, or falling into traps, becomes old fast, considering it is still very easy to get away from the assaulters with no consequences. The hunt for Tomeji's most trusted companions is another great example of the content bloat in the expansion. Although it is optional, going after these men is somewhat required to make the fight against Kimura Yukari's strongest warrior more manageable, but doing so doesn't add much to the experience, as, with some exceptions, they are regular enemies with more health and armor. When you spend more time looking for these targets rather than actually fighting them, it's clear how there's an issue.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji isn't a bad expansion, and those who loved the base game will probably find plenty to like in it if they are not tired of the formula. The main issue is that almost everything, from story and characters to map design, quest design, and optional content, is unremarkable and doesn't add anything new to the experience, with the exception of the new Bo weapon and the Nowaki questline, which are great, high-quality additions that definitely deserved better to shine even more.</p>

				<p>With average quest design, a lack of polish, and a forgettable story, Assassin’s Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji shows how the series’ quantity-over-quality approach is continuing to fail. While the Bo weapon for Naoe and the excellent Nowaki questline stand out, they’re drowned by questionable design choices that undermine the experience, making the expansion worthwhile only for the most die-hard fans.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-review-more-of-the-same-not-in-a-good-way.1299015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Only a few months after the lackluster ending of<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c9d86c47-b86e-43a2-bfe0-a023f6d37eee" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em> Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, it's time for us to return to Japan again for the<em> Claws of Awaji DLC</em> with a continuation of Naoe and Yasuke's story. With the promises of a new island, a new story, and a new weapon, was it worth it to hop back into <em>Shadows </em>for one more adventure?</p>

<p>The story of the <em>Claws of Awaji</em> opens with a mysterious message from Hattori Hanzo about a puppetmaster telling the story of an assassin that travelled to the island of Awaji with a hidden blade on her arm. Still on the hunt for her mother, Naoe begins her investigation of the island to try to confirm whether this mysterious assassin is indeed Tsuyu.</p>

<p>I was a big fan of the beginning of <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. A brief amount of time spent on the mainland with an emotional setup for Naoe and a good reason for you to visit the island. That, coupled with the linear storytelling, made it clear that there was more focus and direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-puppet-show.jpg?itok=aJfBQWFW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-puppet-show.jpg?itok=9qmfU8Zx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playing the puppeteer's story was a nice addition</figcaption></figure><h2>A Story That's Good For A Bit… Until It Isn't</h2>

<p>These first few missions are a focused experience with a mix of missions you can play as Naoe or Yasuke, or character-specific missions where you hop between the two. This also lent to the strength of this DLC. I appreciated the linear nature of the story and how there were valid reasons for why I might approach a mission with Yasuke instead of Naoe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after about an hour of this more refined experience, the DLC took a page from the base game. After identifying your primary target, you then identify their primary lieutenants and characters who support the lieutenants. From there, you're dropped into the open world, working on your hit list from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>All of that sense of direction, narrative, and progression flew out the window as I was just checking off boxes on my to-do list. Each major milestone, I'd look forward to some big enhancement of the plot, only to be met with additional newly revealed subordinates that were a horse ride and a quick assassination away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-horse-riding.jpg?itok=QAsYLVTM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-horse-riding.jpg?itok=_MDRObNa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of missions at different ends of the island justify the square footage of Awaji</figcaption></figure><p>The openness of the world and options to tackle these objectives in whatever order you want seems to have a direct negative effect on how engaging the story can be. There can be no references or callbacks to defeating a different powerful enemy, because there's no way to know if the player has experienced that yet. The alternative would be planning for every permutation, but the amount of additional work that would be required for that just wouldn't make sense.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the full game that this DLC also carries forward with is a lack of a worthwhile resolution. Much like how the base game just… ends, this DLC does the same. I don't want to spoil the plot, but the resolution felt more like a reminder that there was more to do in the open world rather than reaching the conclusion of a major milestone in a story.</p>

<h2>A Boss Battle Head And Shoulders Above The Rest</h2>

<p>The standout setpiece from this DLC is the boss fight against an antagonistic shinobi. Set in a mysterious arena with trapped statues meant to look like your foe, you complete this boss battle by hunting after the sounds of your opponent, creeping up on them, and chipping away at their health.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-traps.jpg?itok=73icJn1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-traps.jpg?itok=CuaBEnXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mazes of traps were the highlight of the Claws of Awaji experience</figcaption></figure><p>The arena is filled with grass and water to hide in, but also traps and misleading statues that try to lure you into a trap and deal damage or poison. As a player you're pushed to not rely on stats or what the best weapon in your arsenal is, but instead the stereo audio, keeping an eye out for traps, and watching for your target.</p>

<p>This was an incredible boss battle from start to finish and really showed off the 'Assassin' aspect of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>.</p>

<h2>A New Weapon For Technical Fighting</h2>

<p>In addition to the new adventure, the <em>Claws of Awaji DLC</em> also introduces a new weapon for Naoe. A core aspect of the combat in <em>Shadows</em> is down to not just attacking your opponents, but also reading their movements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Bo weapon takes this a step further by providing you with a weapon where you can attack in a basic combo with light hits, but also very selectively use heavy attacks to push enemies back, attack them high to stun them, or drop low to take them out at their feet.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-narrative-depth.jpg?itok=ToAaIgpW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-narrative-depth.jpg?itok=yhAPub75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This new weapon feels like a next step for someone who's trying to push their technical play further. There's a lot more to think about in terms of movement and strategy, but it does mean that when you do successfully read your opponent and pull off a technical play it can be very satisfying.</p>



<p>I think the best way that I can summarize my experience with <em>Claws of Awaji</em> is that it is a very faithful continuation of the base game. That means that the portions of the game when it's the strongest, like when the narrative can be focused or leaning into stealth, really shine.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the vast open world and "complete it in whatever order you want" mission style weakens the overall narrative, which is really what a lot of people come to an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game for. A story that should have narratively wrapped up two of the largest plot threads from the original game with a bang, just ended up fizzling out…</p>

<p>If you were a fan of<em> Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> then you'll likely enjoy the ~8-hour experience that is <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. Otherwise,&nbsp;you'll likely want to let this DLC pass you by.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[OneOdio Focus A6 Wireless Headphones Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/oneodio-focus-a6-wireless-headphones-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oneodio-focus-a6-wireless-headphones-review.1298982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As we hurtle steadily towards the festive season, manufacturers of all and sundry are set on filling the space underneath your spruce with as many of their own products as humanly possible. OneOdio, a Chinese audio specialist, are also set on getting you there on a budget, with their latest, the Focus A6, coming in at a thoroughly reasonable £55. Does this make it a budget king in 2025? It certainly comes pretty close.</p>
<p>The OneOdio Focus A6 sure is a pair of wireless headphones. That’s not a knock, but this is a thoroughly understated and relatively unassuming pair of cans. Decked out all in Midnight Black – it’s also available in the light Ivory Blush – you could almost be forgiven for thinking they’re an older pair of Sony’s iconic XM3/MX4 headphones, were it not for the small OneOdio logo on each earpiece and gold ring circling it.</p>



<p>After the larger, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/oneodio-a5-headphone-review/">XM5-aping A5</a>, this is a welcome step back. I like their looks, opting for subtle rather than overpowering, but that does make them feel slightly unremarkable. I guess that’s a plus or negative depending on how much of an extrovert you are, and whether you view headphones as a fashion accessory.</p>
<p>The Focus A6 feel quite plasticky. There are areas here where that plastic feels thin and cheap, particularly at each end of the metal headband, where it joins to the earpiece joints. If you’re sensitive to a spot of plastic ick, then this is the worst part of the A6, but other areas such as the metal headband and its suitably plush memory foam padding help to balance things out. I’ve worn them for hours at a time and I don’t feel like I need to take them off; the leatherette earpads in particular are really soft, and that light plastic does help to keep the weight down to a head-pleasing 240g.</p>

<p>It doesn’t necessarily make the A6 feel weak either. I was able to twist and pull at the headband without wrecking it, and the A6 has been robust enough to be folded up and chucked into my backpack with a lunchbox bouncing along beside it. The fact they fold up is also a huge bonus when everyone else seems to have forgotten that this is a really handy thing for headphones to do.</p>

<p>Some people will rejoice at the news that the Focus A6 has physical controls – seated in easy reach on the right earpiece – and they do exactly what you need them to do. The cheap plastics carry through here, but with a toggle for ANC, Power and a volume rocker that doubles up for playback control, you can definitely live with it.</p>
<p>Despite the slightly underwhelming aesthetics, the Focus A6 is packing a host of features that are worth talking about. Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation nestles up to wired and wireless Hi-Res certification, with support for the LDAC codec ensuring that your experience sounds as true to the original recording as possible, though not on Apple products.</p>
<p>You’ve got to do a bit of work to get there though. The standard sound profile of the Focus A6 is thoroughly lifeless, and it’s lucky that the OneOdio app is on hand to bring everything up to scratch. There’s only three preset EQs, and of these, only the Pop setting comes close to being useful. Fortunately, there’s space for three custom EQ presets, and I found that dialling things in with a deep scoop in the mid-range brought out the best of the A6, at least for the rock and metal genres I tend to listen to.</p>

<p>Embarking on a Nine Inch Nails marathon thanks to the brand-new Tron Ares soundtrack, my first port of call was the album’s first single, As Alive As You Need Me To Be. The A6 did a great job here, delivering the dark synth tones and thumping beats with a surprising level of clarity. It’s warmer rather than detailed, and it feels like the A6 has been designed as a real crowd-pleaser with its approachable audio abilities and welcoming price point. If you’re looking for absolute detail, you might want to look elsewhere, but when it’s handed a lossless piece of audio, the Focus A6’s 40mm drivers sound good. You might find they sound even better when you think about how little they cost, and they’re a huge step up after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/oneodio-a5-headphone-review/">their bass-heavy predecessor</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the budget pricing, there’s the welcome inclusion of Hybrid ANC. This now-essential inclusion helps to reduce external noises, and lets you focus on whatever you’re listening to, rather than the big bad real world. It’s clearly nowhere near the level of Sony or Bose over-ear masterpieces, but the A6 costs a quarter of the price, and their performance far exceeds that. There is an audible low-level hiss when activated and without any audio playing, but that disappears in normal use. The corresponding Transparency mode isn’t as clear as the best efforts out there, but once again, it’ll serve you well when you’re ordering a coffee or paying at the checkout.</p>
<p>There’s also a very healthy 40 hours of battery life here with the ANC enabled, and a whopping 75 hours with it turned off, which trounces both Sony’s XM5 and newer XM6, and leaves the Bose QuietComfort Ultra in the dust. They might both have more effective ANC, but it clearly comes at a cost to battery life. If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t want to think about charging their gear too often, this is the headset for you.</p>

<p>There are a couple of bonus features to enhance your audio consumption with the Focus A6, but they come with a pair of caveats. The first is the low-latency Game Mode, which is perfect for competitive mobile gaming, but can only operate alongside the less detailed AAC codec, and this forces you to reconnect the headphones when you switch. Alongside that, there’s a Cinema Mode, which slightly ups the immersion when watching big blockbusters, but which is fiddly to activate. If there was a way to activate either modes on the headset, I could see them being useful, but it’s unlikely I’ll hop into the app to toggle them on, especially when the headset does a decent enough job on its own.</p>
<p>The OneOdio app also takes care of the things you’d hope for, including updating your headset to the newest firmware. I was impressed by how quickly and easily this was done, especially when other, far bigger firms somehow struggle to reliably update their own headsets without losing connection. From here you can dig into all the settings, and there are two additional ANC modes, with wind reduction options for both ANC and transparency. It’s nice to have them, and they do help to drop interference from the wind to a small extent, but once again, it’s an additional setting in the app to have to reach for, and largely, you’ll be happy with the standard ANC settings.</p>
<p>The sub-£100 category has become so competitive in the last couple of years, and the OneOdio A6 has brought the fight to its competitors. It’s on a par with the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/07/final-ux2000-headset-review/">Final UX2000</a>, though the Final pair may just edge it on the comfort front. There’s also the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/09/monoprice-bt-600anc-headset-review/">Monoprice BT600-ANC</a> to consider, which has the benefit of coming with its own hard case as well.</p>
<p><em>There’s currently a nice little discount available on the <a href="https://bit.ly/4em8cFG">official site</a> with the following discount code ONESPPRMR (15% OFF), making the A6 even better value. Valid from July 7 to September 30.</em></p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games announced the launch of Operation Nemesis, a major milestone for its MMOFPS EVE Vanguard. The studio has famously attempted to link its long-running sci-fi MMORPG EVE Online to a shooter game with the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-working-on-new-ue4-powered-fps-for-pc-as-dust-514-is-discontinued/">Dust 514</a> and its spiritual successors that never saw the light of release, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Nova</a>. Despite the failures, CCP Games continued to find the right way to achieve that vision, and now they're one step closer with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-londons-game-is-a-genre-defining-hugely-ambitious-eve-shooter-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London studio's game</a>.</p>



<p>Starting with Operation Nemesis, Warclones on the ground (in EVE Vanguard) and Capsuleers in the cosmos (in EVE Online) will now influence the same conflict. Vanguard squads uncover intel that enables Capsuleers to reveal and raid Upwell convoys in space. This persistent economic and military connection unites boots-on-the-ground combat with interstellar warfare, giving players the power to shape the fate of New Eden together.</p>



<p>Snorri Árnason, Executive Producer at CCP Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Operation Nemesis marks a major milestone for EVE Vanguard. This is the first real taste of our much grander vision: We’re delivering a persistent, online sandbox shooter where your actions resonate across a living, player-driven universe. With the foundations in place, we’re now fusing new systems into the framework as we set the stage for Early Access. EVE Vanguard is growing with every milestone, and players are starting to see the boundless potential of the ultimate sci-fi experience we’re building: one universe, one war, fought across space and planets.</em></p>



<p>Scott Davis, Game Director for EVE Vanguard, added:</p>



<p><em>The feeling at CCP’s London studio is that we’re building the game of our dreams. EVE Vanguard represents our vision for a bold new FPS that combines the intensity of brutal combat with the depth and persistence usually reserved for MMOs. Operation Nemesis is the most significant step forward so far, giving fireteams and solo operators the chance to battle-test and influence the game ahead of next year’s Early Access launch. So grab your friends, squad up, and help us build it together. We’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what’s to come.</em></p>

<li><strong>Evolved Adversaries:</strong> Face off against distinct new enemy classes, such as the relentless Charger and the imposing Opressor, which add layers of challenge and unpredictability.</li>

<li><strong>Expeditions:</strong> Warclones can accept assignments that align them with corporations and factions from across the EVE universe, unlocking unique rewards.</li>

Being attacked by unique creatures and androids from the underground, Moma fights back using weapons she crafts along the way. Sometimes, the stunning views of the underground world steal her heart as she uncovers the mystery behind the downfall of underground humanity and the truth about “YOU.” Her quest for answers drives her to continue exploring the depths.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> and Battle</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Crafting System Where Your Drawings Transform into Weapons</strong> – To survive the harsh underground environment, you must craft weapons and armor depending on the circumstances. You can create your own weapons and armor by combining various parts. It’s up to you to decide whether to make them more powerful for attacking, easier to defend against enemy assaults, enhance mobility for quick movement, or go for a stylish look – it’s all up to your imagination!</li><li><strong>Combat System Where the World Stops When You Stop</strong> – By using the “Biotope Jammer” brought from space, Moma can freeze all movement around her while she remains still. It is essential to think carefully and adapt according to the situation.</li><li><strong>Unique Battles</strong> – In these battles, you can see the enemy’s attack power, and you can reduce their power by hitting them with your crafted weapons. However, when your crafted weapon hits the enemy, it starts to crumble. Once it surpasses a certain threshold, it enters an automatic recovery mode and becomes temporarily unusable. This leads to strategic battles where you have to figure out how to preserve your own weapons while dealing damage to the enemy.</li></ul><p><strong>Unique Storytelling Through Parallel Worlds</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Story that Changes with Every Replay</strong> – This game employs a “multi-ending” structure, branching based on encountered levels and specific conditions. Moreover, these endings can influence the next player’s gameplay (the past “Moma” in parallel worlds). With each playthrough, you’ll notice changes in the same NPCs (the androids) as well. With various parallel worlds, you can repeatedly enjoy the evolving story. Discover the ending that Moma desires the most!</li><li><strong>Discovery of the Unknown</strong> – In the underground, you’ll find numerous floors that make you wonder, “Why would something like this be underground?!” While enjoying short stories from those floors and learning about past humanity, players gradually piece together the puzzle of what befell past mankind. However, is that understanding truly accurate? Delve into the joy of unraveling a complex story woven across multiple parallel worlds!</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Million Depth</em> is due out for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on November 12.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/million-depth-demo-now-available]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Mutations are the key to making your fortune in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a>. Each one makes plants more valuable, while pets gain the ability to convert plants or other animals into the mutated variant. Therefore, if you want to make a lot of money quickly, you’ll need these mutations or ways to manipulate the odds and get these multipliers easily.</p><p>Discovering which are the best Grow a Garden mutations is a huge reason why everyone is playing this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a> every day.

These range from which ones you should focus on getting to start with, to why events are so valuable, and which pets give you the mutation with the highest multiplier.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#The_best_Grow_A_Garden_mutations">The best Grow A Garden mutations</a></li><li><a href="#All_Grow_A_Garden_Mutations_and_effects">All Grow A Garden Mutations and effects</a><ul><li><a href="#Standard_mutations">Standard mutations</a></li><li><a href="#Event_mutations">Event mutations</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4559474-best-grow-a-garden-mutations-combo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4559474" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4559474-best-grow-a-garden-mutations-combo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4559474"></a><figcaption>Combining mutations turns an otherwise worthless strawberry into a fruit worth hundreds of thousands of Sheckles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4559474-best-grow-a-garden-mutations-combo.jpg"></figure><h2 id="The_best_Grow_A_Garden_mutations">The best Grow A Garden mutations</h2><p>The best Grow a Garden mutations are:</p><ul><li>Shocked</li><li>Paradisal</li><li>Celestial</li><li>Dawnbound</li><li>Sundried</li><li>Frozen</li><li>Zen</li><li>Corrupt</li><li>Disco</li><li>Meteoric</li></ul><p>Obviously, the best Grow A Garden mutations are the ones that give you the highest multiplier bonus for selling the affected plants at the shop. For example, Shocked, Paradisal, Celestial, and Dawnbound all give the highest increase of values available in the base game without any events. However, they’re also the most difficult to obtain as they require either luck for the plant to be hit by lightning or meteors, combining even rarer weather effects, or submitting sunflowers to a god that rarely appears. Pets with the Ascended mutation give plants a whopping 150 times their value, but you’ll rarely, if ever, see them.</p><p>As for the more commonly available base game weather events, Heat Wave weather gives Sundried mutations, which have a massive 85x multiplier. They’re rare, but only require the Heat Wave weather to be in effect to apply to your crops or pets. The rates do drop significantly from here, though a Frozen crop gives 10 times the value of the base crop and is relatively easy to get, provided a Wet or Drenched plant is subjected to a Frost weather effect. Sushi Bears also grant plants the Frozen effect.</p><p>Your best bet is to focus on the event-only weather conditions and unlocking the associated pet. Obtaining the animal companion requires a lot of investment of time and resources, completing event quests, and eventually buying the egg to stand a chance to hatch the correct critter. Some events also trigger effects, such as the Zen update’s Zen and Corrupt weather, which automatically converted plants and gave them an extra 20 times their overall value. The most valuable event pets in the game are the Disco Bee and the Lobster Thermidor, as they have a chance to affect your crops with the Disco and Meteoric mutations, respectively, granting affected plants 125 times their value.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

            <p>
Pocketpair is aiming for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> 1.0 release in 2026, following the game's launch in early access at the start of 2024.
</p>
<p>
In a video update, Pocketpair revealed it's working on big fixes and clean-up of the game ahead of a full release next year, though there's still more content planned for the rest of 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since its initial launch, Palworld has become a remarkable success: it sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-passes-5m-copies-sold-in-three-days">6m copies in just four days</a>, and has the third highest concurrent player count on Steam ever at over 2.1 million players. In that time, though, the company has been rocked by an ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">made changes to gameplay despite disputing claims of infringement</a>.

<p>
Pocketpair has shipped five major updates to Palworld, each adding new elements to gameplay like raids, new environments, and cross-play with other platforms. 
</p>
<p>
"Now we've reach a crossroads and need to decide what comes next," explained Palworld communications director Bucky in this video update. "While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about Palworld 1.0.
</p><p>
"Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit Early Access. It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game."
</p>
<p>
That's why the studio will be a little quieter until the 1.0 release, although a winter update is still planned - just smaller than last year's.
</p>
<p>
What's more, Pocketpair now has a publishing arm and is working on multiple projects. It's already released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take with Abubakar Salim's Surgent Studios</a> this year, with more to come.
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair itself is also working on new projects, though the majority of its efforts remain on Palworld leading to that 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>Nintendo, meanwhile, is increasing its catalogue of patents. Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">new patent was granted that could have implications across the games industry</a> - but is it enforceable?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is now only three weeks away from its October 10 launch date. Fans are counting down days following the successful beta, and the developers share more info through interviews. Yesterday, Technical Director Christian Buhl <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that having to optimize for a lower spec hardware like the Xbox Series S actually benefited the more powerful platforms, too.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Buhl and Senior Console Combat Designer Matthew Nickerson have discussed the importance of delivering a great console experience in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Nickerson joked it was like the game was 'secretly console first'.  </p>



<p><em><strong>Christian Buhl:</strong> I could say we've been thinking about console and the console experience from the start of Battlefield 6. It has been a top-of-the-line thing. We have to build this game as if it was made primarily for console players. Obviously, we're still also thinking about PC players, but in the past, frankly, Battlefield was built as a PC game and then ported to console, and it probably felt like that. That is not how this game was built. We built this from the beginning with the idea in mind that this is going to be on both console and PC. It has to feel and play like it is a console game that was built to be a console game.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Matthew Nickerson:</strong> We have a saying here in the office, in Ripple Effect when I joined the team, that I created, called 'Secretly Console First.’ It's a little moniker that kind of pokes fun. We don't want to, obviously, tear down or destroy any of the legacy that Battlefield has, which is, first, a PC game, but we really have to care about console at the end of the day. We've been putting in the reps, putting in the work, just like Christian said. Console has been at the forefront of Battlefield 6 development since day one, and really, we're honed and we are well-crafted in providing this product at the highest quality possible.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, the two also shared that Battlefield 6 will offer console players the option to turn off cross-play with the PC version (which they may want to do in case of cheating issues) while maintaining cross-play between Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 consoles. When cross-play with PC is enabled, the matchmaking system will still look for console players first if you're playing on Xbox or PlayStation, only expanding the search to include PC if the lobby requires more players. Moreover, the developers have revamped aim assist compared to Battlefield 2042 to ensure cross-play is fair for all players.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing of the Battle Royale mode is ongoing on the Battlefield Labs platform</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-dk-island-emerald-rush-hands-on/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza%E2%80%99s-dk-island-emerald-rush-dlc-is-an-odd-mix-of-rare-and-roguelite.1298937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo often makes fans wait a spell for DLC or expansions for their favorite games, so it came as somewhat of a surprise when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">most recent Nintendo Direct</a> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, released only two months ago, was getting DLC the same day as the presentation. The DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC adds a new stage based on DK’s tropical home featured in Rare and Retro Studios’ games, as well as a new fast-paced roguelite mode.</p>



<p>Is the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC a gem or are its flaws all too apparent? Swing on down for my full impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As the title of the DLC implies, the centerpiece of Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is a new HD recreation of the big ape’s island home from the Donkey Kong Country games. Nintendo has really gone all out rendering DK Island in all its glory, packing it with familiar characters, landmarks, and plenty of Easter eggs. It’s a welcome addition to a game that’s really a celebration of the Donkey Kong franchise as a whole, although it is hard to overlook the fact that Super Mario Odyssey included something similar – a stage based on the classic Mushroom Kingdom – as an in-game unlockable, while DK Island is stuck behind a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Super Mario Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom was also fully integrated into the core game, offering fresh challenges to tackle and Power Moons to collect. The same can’t be said of DK Island. While the tropical locale looks nice and will give you fuzzy nostalgic feelings, it strangely sits apart from the main game. There are no new Banandium Gems or fossils to collect here, making the whole experience feel a bit too much like a superficial theme park attraction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At least that’s true until you jump into Emerald Rush mode, which DK Island was clearly designed around. Emerald Rush is essentially an accelerated take on the roguelite genre, with all the gold in the game turned into glittering green gems. Over a series of quick 99-second rounds, you’re challenged to collect a specific quantity of green goodness by smashing ore deposits, defeating enemies, and finding green bananas (again, bananas can only be found on DK Island in Emerald Rush mode). The number of rounds you have to survive depends on the difficulty you’ve chosen, but thankfully, finding emerald fossils will grant you stackable upgrades that will help you as the rounds get tougher.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Emerald Rush is fun enough, in a simple, smashy-smashy sort of way, although it condenses the roguelite experience to such a degree that it all starts to feel a bit meaningless. You'll be picking up a <em>lot</em> of fossils, requiring you to choose upgrades almost constantly. While I'm absolutely sure some folks will get <em>really</em> into strategizing and finding synergies between upgrades, I found myself succumbing to information overload fairly quickly.</p>



<p>In addition to DK Island, you can unlock the ability to play Emerald Rush on the majority of DK Bananza’s layers, and it will likely take a solid half-dozen hours or more to unlock all the DLC’s new content. Even then, you can pump up the difficulty on each layer for a new challenge. That said, I'm not sure how long the average player is going to stick with the mode. Emerald Rush reminds me a lot of the Balloon World DLC for Mario Odyssey, in that it's something I think <em>some</em> players will really get into, but will be largely ignored by most.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-not-a-knockout-follow-up-punch"><strong>Not a Knockout Follow-up Punch</strong></h2>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush isn't without its charms, but the titular island's lack of integration into the main game, Emerald Rush mode's relatively simple gameplay loop, and a substantial $20 price tag means this DLC will likely only appeal to a relatively small subset of Bananza owners. If you've read through these impressions and are still interested, by all means, dig in, but given how substantial the core Donkey Kong Bananza experience is, others may prefer to keep mining for fun there.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is available now on Switch 2 for $20.</p>
