			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an extremely demanding game that has trouble <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-pushes-ryzen-7-9800-x3d-limits/">running well</a> even on top-end hardware, but a new mod now available online introduces some optimization improvements that bring significant performance improvements at 4K and 1440p resolutions.</p>
<p>The Optimization Essentials mod developed by Hybred, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/60?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a variety of tweaks that clean up Unreal Engine's effects quality, reduce ghosting and stuttering and improve loading and boot times. While some of the presets have a big impact on visual quality, the mod introduces considerable performance improvements of up to 25% at 4K and 1440p resolution, as showcased in a new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC, </a>so it's definitely worth using for those who cannot run the game well, no matter the graphics settings used.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Optimization Mod - Up to 25% More FPS | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.8 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUZhbYvN-L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a more than worthy entry in the series, offering exactly what fans expected the game to be. While the experience is sometimes unbalanced, exploring the Zone is incredibly engaging, although its sheer size sometimes works against the experience as a whole, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Let's make one thing clear: STALKER 2 is one of the largest single player shooter games I've played, if not the largest. I reached the end after playing for 47 and a half hours, and that's after abandoning some of the sidequests. While I generally love large games, the sheer size doesn't always work in this game's favor. That's because most of the time you're scattered through the vast, completely seamless 64 square kilometers map, running on one wild goose chase after another. It gets a little repetitive after some time (prepare to visit a dozen different secret laboratories), not to mention slightly tedious for all the reasons explained in the earlier portion of the review. Moreover, while some side missions are interesting, most are fairly run-of-the-mill.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is also part of the Xbox Game Pass library on both PC and consoles.</p>

<p>On December 3, it’ll be 30 years since the original PlayStation first launched in Japan. A system that changed the course of the industry, PlayStation has been at the top of the console market for three decades now. To start the celebration, not only is Sony holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-sale-500-games-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty massive sale</a> on the PlayStation Store, but the company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released</a> a new “Thank You” video for its fans.</p>



<p>“For the past three decades, we’ve shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together,” Sony says in the video description. “Along the way, we’ve found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We’ve forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey — we couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>



<p>The two-minute video shows some of the biggest franchises in the console’s history with various messages about what PlayStation “is about”. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While December 3 marks the official 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, the console didn’t release in North America and Europe until September 1995. That means there’s still another nine months of celebration to happen, and plenty of more time for PlayStation to say “Thank You”.</p>

            <p>
Sony has released a nostalgia-fuelled video to mark PlayStation's 30th anniversary. 
</p>
<p>
It's just gone 3pm here in the UK, which means it's now past midnight on 3rd December in Japan - 30 years to the day since Sony's PS1 first launched in the country. 
</p>
<p>
Sony's video features a montage of classic games past and present that have all had a huge impact on PlayStation's legacy, beginning with Horizon: Forbidden West, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> and The Last of Us Part 2, set to a gentle remix of The Cranberries' Dreams. (Dreams itself does not feature.)

<p>
God of War, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune">Uncharted</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, Marvel's Spider-Man and many more make the cut, and like PlayStation itelf, there's plenty of third-party blockbusters here alongside games from Sony's own studios. 
</p>
<p>
"For the past three decades, we've shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together," Sony wrote alongside the video. 
</p>
<p>
"Along the way, we've found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We've forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey - we couldn't have done it without you."
</p>
<p>Last week we learned a newly-official <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-officially-surpasses-160m-sales-retaining-its-best-selling-console-crown">sales total for PS2 of 160m sales</a>. Here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-playstations-30th-anniversary-london-tube-carriage-looks">PlayStation also rolled out a special tube carriage on the London Underground</a>.</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has a special week of PlayStation-themed content lined up, beginning when 3rd December rolls around here in the UK.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/blizzard-is-removing-original-warcraft-i-and-ii-from-gog-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The classic versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II are being delisted from GOG on 13th December, at Blizzard’s request. However, anyone that buys the games before that date will continue to receive ongoing support from GOG themselves as part of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">GOG Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p>Presumably someone at Blizzard just couldn’t handle the idea that the games are available in their original form when there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/warcraft-and-warcraft-2-remastered-released-alongside-major-update-for-warcraft-3-reforged/">recently been a remaster of the games</a> – a bit like how you can’t buy a legit print of the original Star Wars films, for some reason. These remasters have brought a number of technical improvements, such as multi-unit selection in Warcraft I and right click actions across the board, as well as revised graphics that can be toggled on and off at will.</p>
<p>However, there’s something just a little bit off about the remastered graphics, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJ3ebyzORk">they forgot to accommodate for the tall pixels</a> with the original game that came from playing DOS games on old CRT screens. It means that everything in the remastered game is just a bit… wider. Also the mission briefings have motion that are completely ignored for Blizzard’s remastered versions.</p>


<p>Warcraft on GOG, however, has already had a number of preservation efforts made as it’s integrated into the DOSBox emulator for the original, and with a custom DirectX wrapper for the sequel. As some of the first inductees into the Preservation Program, GOG committed to ensuring that these games would have technical support from them to maintain compatibility with the newest versions of Windows.</p>
<p>GOG is now extending that with a pledge to maintain compatibility even if a game is delisted from their store. It’s worth remembering that games bought via GOG are DRM free, so they can always be downloaded, stored and played later.</p>

<p>As part of this announcement, they’ve cooked up a $2 USD, €2, £1.50 and 8 PLN discount using the code MAKEWARCRAFTLIVEFOREVER on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle">Warcraft I &amp; II Bundle</a>, bringing it down a smidge to £10.39.</p>
<p>The Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest with the full trilogy of Warcraft RTS games is £34.99.</p>
<p>GOG closed out the announcement by saying:</p>
<p>“We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Blizzard on these titles. While the delisting is unfortunate, we assure you that every user who already owns these games on GOG will continue to benefit from our commitment and have access to versions that remain compatible with modern systems, preserving their experience for years to come.</p>
<p>“We’re thankful to every Blizzard employee who contributed to these timeless games and for your ongoing partnership over the years. Game preservation is at the heart of what we do, and we hope to continue collaborating with Blizzard to keep these iconic titles accessible to future generations of gamers.”</p>

            <p>Netease's free to play open world gacha <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Project Mugen now has a proper name: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>. As Edwin points out in the Maw, it is very much like Spider-Man meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, with its mixture of cityslinging and unabashed anime teens with long, flowy hair and a penchant for metal accessories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Project Mugen debuted in August 2023, with devs Naked Rain releasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAPIKxrSDw">slick trailer</a> that showed its anime cast (technically not) webslinging across a lavishly presented city, as well as driving cars and cyberbikes around its neon streets. It garnered a lot of attention. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-mugens-lead-producer-reveals-the-games-and-films-inspiring-this-open-world-action-rpg">IGN</a> has an interview from later that year that goes over combat and microtransactions. Then, there's a bit of a silence.</p>
<p>Naked Rain emerged with a bit of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Project_Mugen/comments/1amcsmw/happy_spring_festival_spring_festivals_messages/">Chinese New Year art</a> in February 2024. In August, they held a recruitment event in Shanghai, where fans could talk with the devs and possibly join the team (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1gbrexs/where_is_project_mugen_a_short_overview_of_things/">here's a link to a reddit post</a> that rounds everything up nicely). Now, they've released a trailer announcing the game's name change and an overview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9py8e7ma7U">with snippets of in-game footage</a>.</p>

<p>So does it look any good? Well, the world is easy on the eye and traversing it seems fun. I'm into the way you can enter shops without any loading screens, and the sneak peaks of combat seem slick. It's still too early to say how it'll all come together, especially when this is a gacha game and will no doubt feature about a bazillion currencies and steer players towards opening their wallets to secure the bunny girls with the highest stats.</p>
<p>There's another trailer dropping on the 4th December, so hopefully that will reveal a bit more on what you'll <em>actually</em> get up to. You can pre-register for Ananta over on <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/preview/">their website</a>, although there's no release date just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-path-of-exile-2-have-co-op-multiplayer-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is coming for the crown of ARPG king. It’s no secret the original PoE has co-op and multiplayer, so I’m here to clear up any questions and confusions relating to Path of Exile 2’s potential co-op and multiplayer—it would be nice to have someone to clear the path with.</p>



<p>Multiplayer takes many forms in 2024: Online multiplayer shooters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, couch co-op tag teams in It Takes Two, and outrageous tests of patience such as Chained Together. I personally love single-player games as much as anyone, but you can’t beat getting together for some harmonious co-op or multiplayer action.</p>



<p>The nature of Path of Exile 2 makes it perfect for either form of gameplay. 2013’s PoE incorporated co-op multiplayer into its action, but this doesn’t mean Path of Exile 2 continues on the multiplayer co-op theme. Let’s see what the developer is cooking up.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-multiplayer-co-op">Is Path of Exile 2 Multiplayer Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Path of Exile 2 team, assemble! Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Good news! <strong>Path of Exile 2 features both online multiplayer and local couch co-op</strong> for you to enjoy the game with other people, either via wi-fi, or sitting next to someone.</p>



<p><strong>The confirmation comes from Grinding Gear Games itself</strong> via an official YouTube announcement trailer and the official FAQ.</p>



<h3 id="h-local-couch-co-op">Local Couch Co-op</h3>



<p>If you consult the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 frequently asked questions post</a>, under the query asking, “Is couch co-op available in Early Access?,” the answer says, “<strong>Yes, you can play Path of Exile 2 in couch co-op mode on a single account right from the start.</strong> The second player will be able to create a character on that account.”</p>



<p>No waiting around and no kerfuffle here—it’s immediate access to local <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-path-of-exile-2-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couch co-op</a> with a player of your choosing. Furthermore, the “Path of Exile 2 – Console Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games” trailer also confirmed couch co-op was slated for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-online-multiplayer-co-op">Online Multiplayer Co-op</h3>



<p>Hammering home the notion of online multiplayer and co-op for Path of Exile 2 is the announcement trailer I referenced above. The trailer says “<strong>Online multiplayer play requires PlayStation Plus membership</strong>.” It also mentions crossplay for Path of Exile 2 too—so you and your friends don’t need to play PoE 2 on the same format.</p>



<p>Check out the cool trailer below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gog-preservation-program-pledges-updates-for-delisted-games-as-warcraft-1-and-2-delisted.1049571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>are to be delisted from its storefront, but don't worry; the recently-announced Preservation Program has had its terms updated to account for occasions like this.</p>

<p>In a press release, GOG confirms that the two real-time strategy games will be removed from its store on December 13th, probably in light of the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>remasters that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor" rel="nofollow">leaked ahead of</a>, and were then confirmed during, the franchise's recent 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>

<p>However, in that same press release, GOG also announces a new feature for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Preservation Program</a>, an initiative that pledges to keep games updated for modern systems whether or not their developers are still supporting said games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=ggjhTDv1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=_eOnWInZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>may be getting delisted from GOG, but you're in luck if you did happen to buy it via GOG's store.</figcaption></figure><p>GOG says that from now on, if a game joins the Preservation Program, it will be supported with updates and compatibility patches "even if it gets delisted from [GOG]".</p>

<p>Thankfully, since "from now on" begins today, that new feature will cover the two original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games, so if you did happen to buy them via GOG, you don't need to worry about them suddenly losing compatibility or support.</p>

<p>In fact, if you've yet to pick up the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on GOG</a>, then you can currently do so using the discount code MakeWarcraftLiveForever, which knocks "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP, or 8 PLN off" your order.</p>

<p>It'll only work with those currencies, but as GOG points out, you can simply change your currency at the bottom of the store page if you're not currently working within one of the supported currencies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=2bzo0wgv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=S0dA5ZlS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be entitled to a discount right now if you pick up the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games on GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>That code's only available to be used once for each user, though, so once it's gone, it's gone. Bear that in mind before you pick up the bundle.</p>

<p>Given that Activision Blizzard doesn't seem to be making the same promise of eternal compatibility and support for its own remastered&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles, you may want to grab these games via GOG if you're looking for peace of mind. We'll bring you more on this, and all other things GOG, as we get it.</p>

<p>Tencent has acquired another new game studio, Chinese studio Kuro Games. </p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Youxi Putao</a> — then found by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> — , Tencent has purchased 37% of the Wuthering Waves developer’s shares. When adding it to the 24.4% it already owned, the new acquisition gives the company 51.4% of the shares, and a controlling stake in the company.</p>



<p>The purchase also makes Tencent the only external shareholder of the company.</p>



<p>According to Kuro Games’ internal memo to staff, the studio will continue to work independently. It was iterated that “operational strategy will remain unchanged”. An example used in the memo was Tencent’s ownership in Riot Games and Supercell.</p>



<p>“Based on our past collaborative experiences with Tencent, we firmly believe that this external shareholder change will provide Kuro with a more stable external environment, further benefiting our future independent operational strategies and long-term development,” the internal memo reads via machine translation.</p>



<p>“Over the past decade, our original intention of creating games has never changed, and it will remain unchanged in the next decade. We will continue to love our players, our games, and our team.”</p>



<p>Kuro Games is set to release Version 2.0 of Wuthering Waves on January 2.</p>



<p>What do you think of Tencent buying another game studio? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/workers-resources-soviet-republic">Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</a>, the Warsaw Pact-era city-building sim from 3DIVISION and Hooded Horse, is getting eight new maps scattered across the globe. These include a map set in the Eastern United States, from approximately New York State down to North Carolina, and another one set in Rock Paper Shotgun's very own United Kingdom, where Karl Marx wrote most of his best stuff.</p>
<p>"Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades," explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords. It's high time we sceptre-kissing Brits learned the importance of a properly joined-up sewage system. Looking at you, Thames Water. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Aside from the USA and the British Isles, the DLC includes maps based on Austria, the Czech Republic, East Germany, France, Estonia and North Korea. "Every map will differ in terms of overall size and the challenges the local topography brings, and they will also come with pre-generated towns, cities, and infrastructure," the announcement release explains. "This will require players to mold and shape their nations over time in order to create a new wave of top-notch Soviet Republics."</p><p>I still haven't played Workers &amp; Resources, but I've greatly enjoyed reading Sin's articles about it. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-review">her review of the 1.0 version</a> from June 2024, she paints a simultaneously appealing and terrifying picture of a game where setting up a recycling service or demolishing a mine requires you to implement a whole infrastructure of specialised workers, vehicles and buildings (there are also plenty of options to simplify the simulation, if desired).</p>
<p>"I could recite a litany of frustrations and wishes, but it would be dwarfed by the novella about how absorbing and fascinating Workers &amp; Resources is," Sin wrote. "I love its conceptual commitment to a planned economy that its genremates observe de facto but don't examine. Its complex models and processes built for the joy and satisfaction of watching them come together. Its foundations in Slovak history and experience, and its refusal to be like anything else."</p>
<p>Sin also has a piece from a couple years back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-ostriv-workers-resources-and-where-town-builders-ought-to-go-next">exploring how Workers &amp; Resources deviates from the liberal American idea of town-building epitomised by SimCity</a>. I imagine she'd be keen to see how the game stacks up when you actually transport it to North America, though I suspect there are mods that do this already. Sort of feels like the logical endgame here is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM">go to space</a>. There are probably mods for that too.

</p><p>The Worlds Map DLC is out on 13th December via Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store, and will be localised into the same languages as the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-talking-s-about-us-half-life-2-mod-blacklists-a-handful-of-youtubers-as-anticitizens-and-blocks-them-from-playing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>There is some spiteful drama in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod is called <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">Half-Life 2 Overcharged</a> and it is described by its creators as an "overhaul modification" with "brand new gameplay and post-processing features". It adds new Combine and alien enemies, plus a bunch of weapons. It was originally released in 2022 and attracted some ridicule from Half-Life modding fans for being underbaked. The enemy AI was broken, crashes were frequent, the weapons were underwhelming or needless, and there were plenty of lighting and graphical issues. </p>
<p>A lot of these problems were meticulously pointed out in videos by YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-v4twgwLR4p-g0mihJsLCw/about">"noclick"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RadiationHazardYT">"Radiation Hazard"</a>, who specialise in the Half-Life games and play a lot of mods for Valve's classic shooters. They didn't show any mercy in their judgement of this one, calling it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xhEXs9M3c">"overhyped"</a>, for example, and cutting down the mod in what you might call a typical YouTuber style. </p>
<p>In the two years since that original release the mod saw some updates, and the YouTubers followed along, tracking changes and sometimes doing follow-up videos to address <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkRD5mhAtQ">whether or not the bugs had been fixed</a>. Some things did get fixed, yes, but many other problems persisted, and new issues even came up, such as strange ragdoll behaviour and vanishing enemies. </p><p>With the recent release of a 2.0 version, the video makers set out to cover the mod once again, only to discover that it would simply crash. An error message would appear, reading: "STOP talking SH1T about us". And any attempt to make the game run was unsuccessful. </p>
<p>"The developers used my Steam ID to somehow block me from playing the mod," said one of the affected players in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvsbZ18izA">a video calling out the modders</a>. "There is a line of code somewhere that was specifically written to block my account from playing this mod."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the mod appears to have been hardcoded to include a list of four "anticitizens" who will be unable to play, according <a href="https://x.com/Comrade_Waluigi/status/1863354606757069134">to this tweet that exposes the modder's code</a>. </p>
<p>Of course, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> is now in full swing and <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">the mod's page on ModDB</a> is inundated with dozens of comments saying "The sun is leaking" - a reference to one of the mod's most recurring lighting glitches. I probably wouldn't have even heard of this mod if the creators had not been this bitter about the poor reception.</p><p>This is a very niche example of the act of blacklisting, which occurs in traditional games criticism as well. Kotaku has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293">blacklisted by Bethesda</a> in the past, for example, presumably for not writing positively enough about their games. We at RPS have never been told overtly by any publisher or developer that we're on a blacklist (why would they admit to that, after all?) but we can tell when it happens; a company becomes chronically uncommuncative, they are not forthcoming with review code, or refuse to answer our queries. Still, even the most bullish of developers have never actually programmed their games to boot out specific critical voices. That is  wild behaviour and, as you can see, it also backfires. No, smart devs save their codey shennanigans to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8256405.stm">catch pirates in funny ways</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has posted a series of images on social media showcasing Terminal, the potential final map in Escape from Tarkov. For months, talk about the spearhead extraction shooter has been centred around the last step that players are waiting for – the ability to <strong>escape </strong>from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Alongside the images, which showcase a dark and brooding map, Buyanov wrote: ‘The place where it all ends?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-all-things">The End of All Things</h2>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov finally hits a 1.0 release, it’ll be delivered with the ability to finally escape from Tarkov. That has been the goal for the last decade or so, and it’ll be a way to finally ‘complete’ the game.</p>



<p>The ultimate endgame objective was teased today on social media by Nikita Buyanov, the head honcho at Battlestate Games:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1863505672601534943
</p></figure>







<p>Escaping from Tarkov is something that has only ever been possible by powering down and stepping away from the desk – but soon, players will be able to do that after firmly completing the game. The only issue is that we have no idea what that’ll look like. Could it be some kind of ‘prestige’ system, allowing players to complete the game over and over again to earn new rewards?</p>



<p>Nobody knows.</p>



<p>The images showcased by Buyanov don’t reveal too much. It’s an industrial area, which we knew already based on the ‘port’ setting on the map, but something that’s never been seen before is a <strong>submarine </strong>docked in the port. Players have already theorised that’s how we’ll finally escape from Tarkov. </p>



<p>What do you think of Terminal? Do you want to finally break free of Escape from Tarkov? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

					<p>I've played a lot of ARPGS throughout the years, from spending a disgusting amount of time in Path of Exile to dipping my toes into Diablo. However, all of them have that same feel that makes them enjoyable and has a unique aesthetic to the ARPG genre that isn't really seen in other genres. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wayfinder-upcoming-echoes-update-changes-it-into-a-premium-game-with-offline-option/">Playing Wayfinder surprised me</a> because it doesn't feel like an ARPG to me, at least in the classic sense of the genre. Instead, to me, it felt more like the kind of game you'd see ported to mobile as a MOBA. It gave me similar vibes to Smite in terms of camera angles and movements, with a cartoonish art style similar to Fortnite or even Palia. Because of these factors, I found it very difficult to get immersed in a game like this.</p>
<p>While for a lot of people, the color scheme and vibrancy of Wayfinder is bound to draw people in, it just didn't for me. Instead, it was a game where I had to turn the brightness all the way down, as it was giving me a headache. This is definitely more of a 'me' problem, as I am sensitive to flashing lights and bright colors, but it was pretty excessive. In some ways, the game reminded me of Borderlands, especially when you were charged with taking out Goblins. Although the combat style is vastly different from something you'd see in Borderlands, the layout and environments felt similar to that of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/wayfinder-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you first open the game, you are hit with a lot of vibrant colors as the story is explained to you. Unfortunately, the story wasn't that memorable, and it wasn't something that I took an interest in during my time playing Wayfinder. For me, I bypassed the vast majority of the story and just tried to get stuck into the combat and exploration of the game, as that was what drew me in the most.</p>
<p>Wayfinder kind of suffers from a feeling of being generic. While the gameplay aspect is a lot of fun, there isn't much that is original. When I was first told about the game and the Critical Role collaboration, I was expecting something more akin to Divinity: Original Sin. Maybe I put my expectations a bit too high. I was expecting more of a roleplay element where you could have more impactful interactions with people and form bonds with the characters you meet, but that didn't seem like much of an option. The characters I spoke to were very well-developed, and they had hefty backstories, but it was hard to find any information about the character you're playing when in discussion with others. There's not really any witty banter or sprinkles of personality that showcase who the character is, regardless of who you choose.</p>
<p>Getting into the nitty-gritty of the content, I found myself really enjoying the combat system of Wayfinder. I chose to play as Ness, the typical edgy-looking rogue. The character designs are all pretty stereotypical, but this didn't bother me too much. The playstyle was fun, albeit it was nothing overly new. Although the combat was a lot of fun and was easy to get stuck into, parrying was difficult. The parry window was very short, but it also shared a stamina bar with dodging and blocking. This made it very difficult not to take damage, as you may be able to dodge one attack and block another, but you could very quickly run out of stamina before being able to parry the third. My main issue with this was that the enemies often came thick and fast, or they'd be joined by a much stronger enemy, making an easy fight very tense and challenging. Despite that, the combat provided a much-needed thrill in the game, and it was fun being able to Shadow-step through enemies to destroy them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/wayfinder-gear-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gear system was a bit confusing, and I felt that it wasn't explained very well. While the gear was easy to find in your inventory, you'd find that you could also pick up gear for the other Wayfinders available to play. This made it a bit confusing for me at first, as I assumed any gear I'd pick up would be for my specific character. The upgrading system available was also a bit finicky to get used to, and you're immediately thrown into dungeons to collect resources that you have no idea how to use.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with Wayfinder was pretty average. Unfortunately, nothing about the game stuck out, and there wasn't much that felt unique or groundbreaking. While the dungeons were a lot of fun, and the combat was the main thing that drew me in, it wasn't enough to keep me playing. Hopefully, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/Wayfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game continues to get updated</a>, new content and features will be added to improve the game.</p>

<p>There was nothing that stood out from the game, and the story didn't particularly grab me. The main selling point for me was the combat and dungeon-crawling, which was quite fun. However, Wayfinder still needs some work to give it that extra sparkle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Ryosuke Yoshida has quit NetEase's Ouka Studios in order to join Square Enix following reports of extensive layoffs at the former.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1863418476637118944" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>, Yoshida said that he quit Ouka Studios on October 31st, but that he's "grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support" in creating and releasing&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</p>

<p>Describing the process of making the game as "a very good experience", Yoshida then says he "joined Square Enix in December", pledging to "do [his] best to make a game that many people can enjoy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=qtg12jgr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=y0G5Rvvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s director has jumped ship to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director's&nbsp;message drew responses from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1863423587774025919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>community manager John "Bucky" Buckley</a>, who said he's "looking forward to seeing what [Yoshida does] next", as well as <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1863419145943208328" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi</a>, who welcomed Yoshida to the company.</p>

<p>Yoshida's decision comes a few months after a report claiming that Ouka Studio, the developer of&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">hit by huge layoffs</a> on the day of the game's release.</p>

<p>According to that report, "all but a handful" of developers at Ouka were laid off, and parent company NetEase was planning to close down the studio. Of course, Yoshida doesn't confirm or deny this report, but the timing of his departure seems appropriate if it's true.</p>

<p>Ouka's apparent shutdown may also be coming from the same place as NetEase's recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">decision to pull funding</a> from ex-BioWare writer Mac Walters' studio Worlds Untold, leading said studio to "pause operations" while it seeks an alternative source of funding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=BEuHYcP6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=GihojmDB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yoshida's decision to leave&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>'s development team appears to have come at the right time.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible that Square Enix's willingness to hire Yoshida speaks to a desire for the studio to make a followup to&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, so this might not be the last we hear of the franchise.</p>

<p>Of course, Square Enix itself hasn't been having the best year. Back in September, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">the studio admitted</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>"did not meet [its] expectations", and in April, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-140m-loss-shakeup" rel="nofollow">declared a $140m loss</a> amid a major internal project shakeup.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/visions-of-mana/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/visions-of-mana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

The biggest changes are the welcome removal of microtransactions and the ability to play offline. But the paid app also introduces a number of gameplay additions, including a new location where you can hang out with K.K. Slider, and the option to import custom designs from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">the Switch game <em>New Horizons</em></a> into <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em>. Here’s how it works:</p><p>While you can start up a fresh game if you haven’t played before, <em>Complete</em> seems largely designed so that existing players won’t lose all of their campground progress for good, making it an interesting solution for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23330632/free-to-play-gacha-games-closures-dragalia-lost-kingdom-hearts">an ongoing problem with mobile and live service games</a>. Unfortunately, at launch the game seems to be having issues with save transfers, which Nintendo has acknowledged. “The issue may be occurring due to a high number of users attempting to use this service,” <a href="https://x.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1863524631493382480">the company says</a>.

<p>Visions of Mana Director Ryosuke Yoshida has announced that he joined Sqaure Enix this December.</p>



<p>The announcement came from Yoshida’s X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1863418476637118944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where he said, “On a personal note, I quit NetEase Ouka Studios on October 31st. We were a new studio, but we were able to release Visions of Mana. I am grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support. It was a very good experience. Thank you all. I am happy to announce that I joined SQUARE ENIX in December.”</p>



<p>Visions of Mana was released on August 29, 2024, by Square Enix and received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregated Metacritic. The game sold approximately 40,000 units in Japan in its first on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, but Square Enix is yet to announce wider sales numbers.</p>



<p>Before joining Square Enix, Ryosuke Yoshida worked on Devil May Cry 5 at Capcom as a game designer.</p>

            <p>Switch strategy RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/triangle-strategy">Triangle Strategy</a> has been removed from the Nintendo eShop for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Although the 2022 game is still available on Steam, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed via X/Twitter that for now, it is "temporarily unavailable" for Nintendo Switch. Players who have already purchased it, however, can still download it at their leisure .</p>

<p>Square Enix did not expand on why the game had been withdrawn from sale on the Nintendo eShop, nor give any indication of when it will return. </p>
<p>"Triangle Strategy is temporarily unavailable to purchase on Nintendo Switch eShop," wrote Square Enix. "Those who have already bought the game will be able to download it.</p> <div>

<p>"We are working on this and will update when the game is able to be purchased again."</p>
<p>A similar issue happened with Square Enix's RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> back in March. That too was temporarily delisted after it switched publisher between Nintendo and Square Enix.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nintendo and will update as and when we find out more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/triangle-strategy-sells-800k-globally-in-two-weeks">Triangle Strategy sold 800k copies globally in its first two weeks</a>, 200k of which were sold in Japan and Asia alone.</p>
<p>In Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/triangle-strategy-review-an-enjoyably-complex-tale-of-a-battle-over-salt">Triangle Strategy review</a>, we said that "despite moving slowly in both its story and in combat, Triangle Strategy ultimately rewards your patience".

The dark side.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As if the GTA 6 community didn’t already have enough to contend with, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">images of the moon leading fans towards dead ends</a>, now they’re pinning their hopes on an innocuous YouTube playlist update that may or may not be debunked, and are even having to contend with AI-generated images designed to hoodwink fans into thinking they’re leaked screenshots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it was always going to descend into madness, given we’re now amid the one-year anniversary of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak">GTA 6’s record-breaking Trailer 1</a> and developer Rockstar has yet to follow it up with any new information or assets. Fans are left having to pick over what they think might be clues as to when Trailer 2 will finally drop, and there’s hardly anything to go on. So, when Rockstar’s official YouTube channel gets a playlist update this close to the one-year anniversary of GTA 6 Trailer 1, fans predictably struggled to cope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But! This YouTube playlist update appears to be little more than a part of regular updates, at least that’s what some are saying. Stand down! Or, maybe, just lean forward on the edge of your seat. Forgive the double negative, but this doesn’t mean Rockstar won’t reveal GTA 6 Trailer 2, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, moderators of the 1.1 million member strong GTA 6 subreddit (can you imagine how many members it’ll have when the game eventually comes out?!) are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h3zcr6/here_are_some_more_fan_made_ai_images_inspired_by/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removing AI-generated images of GTA 6</a> that are doing the rounds, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h4djwj/it_would_be_really_funny_if_someone_leaked_an/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">misleading some into thinking they’re official screenshots</a> when in fact they’re yet more AI slop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No AI generated fake and misleading content,” declares the sub rules. “Fake ‘leaks’ and misleading AI generated content will be removed, but quality AI generated fanart is encouraged. AI generated content will be removed at the moderators discretion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Incredibly, fans are returning to GTA 6 Trailer 1 to unearth new… information, if you can call it that. For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h4iwyh/fact_there_are_152_feet_shown_in_the_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one person counted how many feet are shown in the trailer</a> (152, if you were wondering). Another went to the trouble of coming up with a formula to work out exactly how many holes are in Lucia’s cell door net.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone nearly a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later. Perhaps this week!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h3zd88/fact_there_are_exactly_1707_holes_in_lucias_cell/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vran_n / reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
