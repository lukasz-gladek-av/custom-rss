            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geoguessr-steam-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular geographical guessing game&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Steam, so you'll soon be able to completely fail to guess where on earth a random muddy field is through Valve's platform.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/geoguessr/status/1904516547806150715" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the game will be launching via Steam Early Access sometime in April, and the Early Access version will include both Solo Duels and Unranked Team Duels.</p>

<p>Playing Unranked Team Duels will be free, but the Solo Duels mode will require a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>Steam Pass. If you've got a subscription on the browser version of the game, that won't translate to the Steam edition, so you'll have to fork out some more cash if you want to play Solo Duels on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=K37JT8aw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=UILe_i1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, but there are a few catches.</figcaption></figure><p>You won't be able to use your&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>browser account to play the game on Steam; it's technically a new game, so it'll require a new account as well, although it sounds like you'll just be able to use your regular Steam profile.</p>

<p>You will, however, be able to access crossplay between&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>on Steam and the browser version of the game, so even if your buddies aren't playing via Steam, you should still be able to play with (or against!) them.</p>

<p>If you do intend to play Solo Duels, you'll rise through the ranks gradually in order to prove yourself as a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>champion. It promises to be exactly as addictive as the regular browser version of the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr</em>, the clue is in the name; it's a game that shows you a random picture from somewhere around the world, and it's up to you to use context clues (or just wild guesses) to figure out where the picture might show.</p>

It will likely be one of the biggest game releases in history. Millions of players are planning to buy the Rockstar’s open-world crime sim while inevitably ignoring other games. That’s bad news for publishers and developers working on new games or big updates for live-service titles. As a result, some of these companies are reportedly creating plans to avoid <em>GTA 6</em> entirely<em>.</em></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,196424,195922" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On March 25, reporter Christopher Dring—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over at his recently launched newsletter and podcast <em>The Game Business</em></a></span>—reported that he spoke to senior executives at multiple large video game publishers about<em> GTA 6</em>'s upcoming release, and how it will impact their plans and decisions. While they all had slightly different answers and thoughts, the general consensus was that nobody wanted to directly compete with Rockstar’s juggernaut. </p><p>“We don’t want to be anywhere near [<em>GTA 6</em>]. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles,” said an unnamed boss at a massive publisher.</p><p>Another exec at a big game company told the outlet that it’s “tough out there,” even without<em> GTA 6</em> around. “It’s immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine,” they said, and added that free time is “the real scarcity for us, not money.”</p><p>A third executive,  in charge of a large European publisher, said “We don’t want to launch just before or just after the game. If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early—which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates. Or go later, putting you up against the Black Friday sales.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard reports of publishers being nervous about <em>GTA 6</em> and changing plans to avoid it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In February, EA boss Andrew Wilson alluded to <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s launch</a></span>, saying, “There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">In that same month</a></span>, <em>Game File</em>’s Stephen Totilo reported that he heard “everyone’s waiting for Take-Two and Rockstar” to pick a release date for <em>GTA 6</em> before anyone commits to a fall launch. </p><h2 id="h36"><a id=""></a>Live service devs are worried about <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></h2><p>And its not just publishers nervous about<em> GTA 6</em>'s massive impact on the industry. <em>The Game Business</em> reports that people working on two popular live-service games are watching closely and will likely push updates back to get out of Rockstar’s way. </p><p>“<em>GTA 6 </em>is basically a huge meteor and we will just stay clear of the blast zone,” said one studio exec. “We will nudge our releases back or forward three weeks to avoid it.

If that happens, that means all the games that moved out of 2025 to avoid it would end up jumping right into its blast radius, unless they quickly delayed again or can move releases dates forward. According to the Dring, publishers he spoke to have multiple plans in place just in case. </p><p>“If we move out of 2025, what if Rockstar do, too?” said one exec. “Will we have time to push our game up? Or will we have to delay further? It’s stressful.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Goat Simulator developers Coffee Stain North has announced the debut of its inaugural Goat Direct showcase on April 1, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-goat-direct-arrives-on-april-1">Goat Direct Arrives on April 1</h2>



<p>The highly anticipated Goat Direct is being hosted on April Fool’s Day, and many fans are wondering if this is all just an elaborate prank. However, the developers have explicitly stated that they “promise the ‘Goat Direct’ is real. The showcase is indeed happening, and all the announcements we see during the presentation “are legitimate. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted on April 1, the original Goat Simulator’s launch anniversary. During the event, fans should expect world premiere reveals for Goat Simulator 3 and some announcements from Coffee Stain North’s partner. The devs will also feature an update on the recently revealed Goat Simulator: The Card Game and more “top secret news.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-and-where-to-watch-goat-direct">How and Where to Watch Goat Direct?</h2>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted through a virtual live stream on the Goat Simulator YouTube channel. Interested players should tune in on April 1 at 15:00 BST / 16:00 CEST / 07:00 PDT / 10:00 EDT to hear all the new announcements first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santiago Ferrero, Creative Director at Coffee Stain North, has stated, “We do realise that announcing lots of new things on April Fool’s Day isn’t always the best of ideas, but we think we’ve truly outdone ourselves this year, so please believe us and tune in to ‘Goat Direct’!”</p>



<p>In other news, a recent claim states that a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct is expected this week</a>.

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch this June, and the new system will be accompanied primarily by first-party titles, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Earlier today,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> reported that during this year's GDC, there was much talk centered on the next-generation Nintendo console, which is expected to launch this June, as has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">rumored</a> for a while. The most interesting reveal, however, is regarding a three-phase games launch strategy, which will begin with a first phase featuring primarily first-party titles, followed by a second phase which should begin in October and November featuring games from third-party studios that should receive a development kit in June and a third phase that will coincide with the Holiday period.</p>
<p>Up until now, we have only heard rumblings and rumors regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, so it's nice to finally hear something about games, although today's report didn't provide any information regarding which games are expected to launch together with the highly-anticipated system. Thankfully, it won't be long until we will finally see something other than a new entry in the Mario Kart series running on the system, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the new system will air next week, on April 2nd. Hopefully, the presentation will also provide some information on what is expected to launch on the system beyond its release window.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will receive its first proper title update on Thursday, April 3rd PT and Friday, April 4th in the UK. The update adds a new social hub to the beast-bashing action-RPG, together with a new monster you might recognise from previous games, some tougher varieties of existing monsters, and a bunch of additional quest types and outfits. Plenty to chew on, once you pick out the bones. Here's a trailer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LryxlqiIi1A" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Let’s start with the monsters. These include the “dazzling and dangerous” Mizutsune, a returning face from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which will be available in both standard and eight-star Tempered varieties. It’s a big frilly rainbow lizard that “moves almost as if it’s dancing, and skillfully attacks foes with debilitating bubbles”, according to a PlayStation blog post. Hands up if you now wish there was a real-life dancing school that involved bubbles. (There probably is.) 
</p>
<p>
As with all of Monster Hunter’s apex predators, Mizutsune is a source of materials for new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-get-layered-armor">armour</a> sets. Where is my bubblesuit, Capcom? How am I supposed to do dancing emotes without a bubblesuit? To hunt (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-capture-monsters">capture</a>) the Mizutsune, talk to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp at Hunter Rank 21 or above. 
</p>
<p>
The first title update also begins Capcom’s rollout of “Arch-tempered” monsters - the toughest monster variations yet. First on the menu is the Arch-tempered Rey Dau, which will be available at Hunter Rank 50 or above as part of an event quest on Tuesday 30th April. 
</p>
<p>
Title update 1 also sees the return of the Zoh Shia in High Rank play, this being a critter that you could hitherto only fight once as part of the story. As of 3rd/4th April, you’ll be able to battle the Zoh Shia repeatedly. Look out for the High Rank Zoh Shia quest in the environment overview. You might also stumble on the poor dear during the Wyvern’s Wakening in the Ruins of Wyveria. Fell it and you can craft some new High Rank hunter and Palico equipment that, to my eye, makes you look like you’ve been tarred and feathered.</p>

</figure>
<p>That’s it for new monsters. But what about the <em>real</em> monsters here – other human players? Well, title update 1 introduces the Grand Hub, a majestic social space that has “long served as a place of worship for the people of Suja”, where carved totems rear above the tents and you might occasionally hear the songs of the faithful after dark. Also, it’s got a bowling alley where you roll barrel bombs at targets to win items and pedants. 
</p>
<p>
To do this, you’ll need Barrel Bowling Vouchers, which you can earn via login bonuses among other means. It’s a retention mechanism, in other words. The Grand Hub will be available from Hunter Rank 16 – just chat to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
What else? Well, they’re bringing back arena quests, which challenge you to complete a hunt as fast as possible using pre-determined equipment, together with limited-time Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests, where you can earn pendants. There’s a new free outfit for Alma, and some other cosmetic DLC gubbins.

</p>
<p>
Capcom are already teasing the game’s second title update, which lands this summer – there’s a glimpse of another new predator in the video above. There is, as yet, no word of any significant overhaul for the PC version’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">technical tribulations at launch</a>. I’m not sure how bad it is right now – have you had any frame rate issues lately?

<p>Capcom has revealed that Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1 will launch on Thursday April 3/Friday April 4, depending on your time zone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal came as part</a> of a 15-minute video on Tuesday that went into details on what players can expect to see in the game’s first major update. </p>



<p>First thing’s first, the title update will be free to all players. It will include a new monster called Mizutsune alongside a new Zoh Shia quest. There is also a new Grand Hub gathering place that players who’ve completed the game’s main story can get together and hangout as well as play a new game called Barrel Bowling. If you want a different type of entertainment, The Diva will be there to perform at night.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Aside from the title update at the beginning of April, there is more to come in late April and May. There is the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance coming from April 22/23 to May 6/7. The Arch-tempered Rey Dau event quest also comes at the end of April and lasts through late May.</p>



<p>Lastly, the second free title update for Monster Hunter Wilds will launch later this summer. That update will include an additional monster, a new seasonal event, and more.</p>

            <p>Nintendo will reportedly launch its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> games in three phases.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/">Insider Gaming</a>, the first phase will see <em>primarily </em>first party games released on the console's launch, which is believed to be June. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">console launch date ties in with what both analysts</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee have predicted will be the case</a>.</p>

<p>The second phase of Nintendo's game launch plan is then reportedly set for around October-November, and will have a greater focus on third-party studios. Sources said these studios are expecting to get their hands on a Switch 2 dev kit in June.</p>
<p>The third and final phase will tie in with the holiday period, Insider Gaming reports. So, to me that's the end of November and then December. 
</p>
<p>Thankfully, there isn't too much longer to go until we hear something more concrete on Nintendo's Switch successor. A dedicated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo Direct focused on the Switch 2 will take place on 2nd April</a>, where we'll presumably hear about the release date and price. And, just maybe, we will hear about more games coming to the console, so don't get your hopes up, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>? Ooh, what about Silksong?! We surely must be getting an update on that soon…</p>

			<p>Unlike other entries in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> isn't all about sneaking around and killing enemies unseen, but stealth is still a big part of the experience, especially if you like using Naoe a lot. While Yasuke can hold his own in a fight against multiple enemies, the shinobi from Iga is almost always at a disadvantage in open combat, as her toolkit is more geared towards stealth gameplay and taking down enemies without being discovered.</p>
<p>Unless you are equipping the best possible gear at any given time, however, Naoe is not always able to kill enemies in a single strike by approaching them silently and using the Assassination ability. Whether it's due to an enemy's high health or armor, there will be times when an Assassination attempt will result in open combat, which can be a massive issue for the young shinobi.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250325132249_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you want to improve Assassin's Creed Shadows' stealth gameplay features without having to constantly hunt down the best possible gear, there's an easy way to make sure both Naoe and Yasuke will always perform<strong> lethal Assassinations</strong>. At any time during the game, enter the O<strong>ptions menu</strong> and access the <strong>Gameplay</strong> tab.&nbsp;<span>Here, pick the&nbsp;<strong>Difficulty Tuning</strong> option, where you can set the Combat Difficulty and the Stealth Difficulty and <strong>turn on Guaranteed Assassinations</strong>.</span>&nbsp;By turning on this option, all your successful Assassinations will automatically kill the target, regardless of the remaining health.</p>
<p>While turning on Guaranteed Assassination in Assassin's Creed Shadows may feel a bit like cheating for some, it is a massive game changer for stealth gameplay, as without it, the Assassination ability leaves something to be desired most of the time. With it on, however, you don't have to worry about anything else other than sneaking around and being a proper, lethal assassin!</p>

<p>Per a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>showcase that aired earlier today,&nbsp;Title Update 1 will arrive on Friday, April 4th. The main attraction when it comes to this update is the introduction of Mizutsune, a water monster that made its first appearance in 2016's 3DS game&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll need to be High Rank level 21 or over to take on Mizutsune, and once you reach this level, you'll be able to grab an Extra Mission after speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest. That's the mission in which Mizutsune waits for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=biImuV5Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=rfjIgQcj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first title update is heading your way soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just Mizutsune that's coming as part of this update, of course. You can also look forward to battling a new Arch-tempered version of new monster Rey Dau, which will be added to the game in a new quest "at a later date".</p>

<p>Zoh Shia, another new monster introduced in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, can now be fought as part of repeatable quests, although you will need to complete a new HR 50 mission in order to access it.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a new hangout spot for you and your fellow hunters, then you can head over to the new Grand Hub, which serves as a place "for hunters to gather and socialize", according to Capcom. There's also a fun new minigame to try out there.</p>

<p>You can check out all of the highlights of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 1 <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_0/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> courtesy of Capcom, and you can take a look at a brand new trailer for the update below.</p>

It's proven to be the most popular game in the franchise by far, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million sales in just three days</a>&nbsp;and breaking records both for the series and for Capcom as a whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">on Steam</a>.</p>

They are, as with any other form of human-invented categorization, arbitrary. The notion of labeling any specific game as one “type” is inherently nonsensical, all art existing on an infinite spectrum, the boundaries of labels drawn utterly subjectively. That’s been the case forever, and it’s notable that about 15 years ago there were growing calls to abandon genre titles altogether as they felt so needlessly restrictive and confusing.</p><p>Of course, instead, we went in exactly the opposite direction and quadrupled down on the concept, as we entered the Era of Tagging. As we desperately tried to maintain some sense of order while the number of games released swelled from “a manageable few” to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands a month</a></span>,” we relied on genre tags to try to establish some notion of control. Except, oh dear God, it was done with no sense, understanding, meaning...it’s been sheer semantic vandalism, and the result is carnage.</p><figure id="" data-id="684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-recommend-id="image://684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Scott Olson / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-recommend-id="image://684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s really important that everyone’s on the same page regarding the subjective nature of genres. And for help, let’s look at fruit! You have, no doubt, either been the person, or been subjected to the person, loudly announcing that tomatoes are, in fact, not a vegetable actually, because they have internal seeds and so they’re a fruit. But, of course, tomatoes are actually a berry. Although a berry <em>is</em> a type of fruit. But it’s eaten, to quote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></span>, “as a vegetable.” Because “vegetable” is the word for the part of any plant that’s eaten as food. So <em>all fruit</em> are vegetables. So tomatoes are, of course, vegetables. And fruit. And berries. And broccoli is a flower. Pistachios and coffee beans are drupes, which are fruit. Avocados are maybe a drupe, maybe a berry, but definitely a fruit. Figs are an infructesence, filled with a multitude of single-seeded fruits (well, drupelets) created as a result of the pollination from specialized fig wasps, all surrounding the central “false fruit.” And peanuts are a legume. Let’s call the whole thing off.</p><p>The point is, <em>none of this is real</em>. These are all arbitrary categories invented by humans, into which the subjects do not usefully fit. Vegetation was just getting on with it, until we came along and tried to divvy them up into supermarket sections. And so it is for video games. Apart from the already existing bit.</p><figure id="" data-id="cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-recommend-id="image://cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-recommend-id="image://cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the very start of gaming, it just made sense to say, “Oh, those games are all adventures written entirely in text. Let’s call them ‘text adventures.’ And these ones are all about making that pixel blob jump between these platforms. They can be ‘platform games’.” That was useful for a good, solid ten minutes, before the imaginations of developers allowed for the merging of ideas, taking inspiration from here <em>and</em> there, and seeing what the results might be. In fairness, there were a fair few years when games could be quickly understood as “graphic adventures,” “god games,” “role-playing games,” or “strategy games,” albeit alongside the always-confusing category of “arcade games,” which originally meant games that were first released for arcade machines, and thus spread across a multitude of genres, but sort of came to mean games where things went “pew pew” and there was a high score table.</p><p>But even then, people were combining strategy and RPG, or including what were always called, in the snarliest of tones, “arcade sections” in graphic adventures. And then first-person shooters came along, so we needed “third-person shooters” to be a thing, and then the angle you looked at something from became a genre, hence “isometric,” and down into the madness we spiralled. I would say the moment all hope was lost was the point at which anyone, anywhere, thought “action game” might be a useful descriptor for <em>anything</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-recommend-id="image://a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="767" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-recommend-id="image://a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="767" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, as I mentioned, post-millennium people began talking about the need to ditch genres as a concept entirely. I remember being involved in heated discussions at various gaming magazines over whether they would stop listing a game’s “genre” as part of the review, given how the decision was really being made based on the personal view of the reviewer, rather than anything inherently born of the game itself. When we were running <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>, the team would frequently argue  over the useful/uselessness of tagging games by genre. It seemed, across the industry, that this terminology might be on the way out.</p><p>And then Steam arrived.</p><p>So, obviously genres never went away. Some games just <em>are</em> the next big first-person shooter, or the real-time strategy game that—oh so ironically—“redefines the genre.” People like to know if something’s a fruit or a vegetable, even if neither term means anything useful in context, and we all knew that this new <em>Monkey Island</em> game was a “point and click adventure” whether we wanted to or not. They served a function, even if it was wildly imperfect, and often deeply unhelpful. (I always think of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> as the perfect example of a game series that can never be usefully classified, hence the absolute blithering nonsense of “action-adventure,” as if that isn’t a term that could be ascribed to just about anything short of a puzzle game.)</p><p>Up until this point, genres were pretty much decided by the developers, even if it was often begrudgingly. The need for a press release meant they had to call their game <em>something</em>, and  “defying genre” too quickly became associated with extremely off-putting braggadocio. Most instead opted for hyphenates, picking two of three genres their game sort of loosely fell into, describing their game as “first-person-strategy-adventure-typing-sim” or what have you. It was only more proof that the whole conceit was nonsense.</p><p>But then the floodgates opened, and everything got flipped upside down. In the last 15-or-so years the explosion of online stores, most especially Steam, and the ease of access to development tools like Unity and Unreal has caused the numbers of games released to grow explosively. From 2008 to 2012, around 300 games were releasing a year onto Steam. In 2012, Valve launched Steam Greenlight, via which games could be voted for to be allowed to release on store, and by 2017 that number had reached 7,000. That year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1265922321514182595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1265922321514182595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve ditched Greenlight</a></span> and replaced it with Steam Direct, where anyone could release a game on Steam if they paid $100. In 2020, around 10,000 games were released. By 2023 it was 14,000. Last year, 2024, that number hit 18,892.</p><figure id="" data-id="fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-recommend-id="image://fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1124" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-recommend-id="image://fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1124" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While developers can select their own genre categories, Steam, as Valve is so wont to do, handed over much of the responsibility for the labelling of genres to its users. And as anyone who’s ever met a group of other people will know, they’re <em>idiots</em>, and giving them the ability to tag games on the online store has led to a whole new form of chaos. Where a decade-and-a-half ago we were taking steps toward a beautiful genre-free future, we’ve now instead just taken a sharp left and jumped off a nearby cliff. Genres now mean <em>nothing whatsoever</em>.</p><p>I first became frustrated by this phenomenon by the demolition of the “adventure” genre. It was, for my entire life, used to describe...well, “adventure games”! These began in the late-70s, early-80s as text adventures, and during the ‘80s evolved into graphic adventures which, once mice became commonplace, would become known as “point-and-click adventures.” (The term has a rather quaint, anachronistic tone nowadays, given that the act of pointing and clicking is hard to remember as revolutionary, but it was meant to distinguish these games from those graphic adventures in which you primarily engaged via a text parser. To this day, among decent-minded people, “point-and-click” has semiotic meaning, a game of the ilk of <em>Monkey Island</em>, <em>Day of the Tentacle</em>, <em>Gabriel Knight</em>, or <em>The Longest Journey</em>. You move a character around scenes, gather items into an inventory, chat with other characters, and solve puzzles by using inventory items on the world.)</p><p>Yet, click on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the “Adventure” tag in Steam</a></span> and you might as well have clicked on a tag for “Game.” The first few games it suggests to me are <em>Pathologic 2</em> (a first-person RPG), <em>Into The Necrovale</em> (a top-down hack-and-slash roguelite), <em>Dark Deity 2</em> (a turn-based strategy RPG!), and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> (an open-world action-RPG). See! Those are literally the first four I saw under the tag, each a wildly different type of game, and none of them in any sense an “adventure.” With half of them, it’s hard to even argue that they’re about <em>having an adventure</em>.</p><p>But it’s so, so much worse than that. Because, you might say, “Oh get over it, old man. We cool kids use ‘adventure’ to describe...games...that exist! Use something more specific!” So OK, I know, I’ll search for something far more precise, the unimpeachably clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure_point_click&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure_point_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Point &amp; Click Adventures.”</a></span></p><p><em>Mr. Prepper</em>: A survival crafting sim.</p><p><em>Steps of Debauchery</em>: A porn visual novel.</p><p><em>Urban Jungle</em>: A “relaxing” puzzle game about growing plants.</p><p><em>Let’s Minesweeper</em>: An online multiplayer tile puzzle game.</p><p>SERIOUSLY?!</p><p>However, I absolutely cannot deny that all these games contain the ability to point a mouse and click. Much like <em>Doom Eternal</em> and <em>Civilization VII</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dan Kitwood / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And so, my opening thesis is proven correct, all opposition is demolished, and everyone in the whole world owes me and everyone else an apology.</p><p>The same phenomenon is true across all genres on Steam, and it’s just the same on Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo’s online stores. These terms have become, for want of a better word, clickbait. People search for this genre term, so stick it on the game. I just looked up “Real-Time Strategy” on Steam (a genre for which I have no interest) and it immediately offered me <em>DOTA 2</em>, then threw in a good handful of turn-based strategy and tower defence games, and <em>so</em> many city builders.</p><p>15 years ago we were arguing that genres were useless because they needlessly boxed in creativity, applying artificial labels to a medium that inherently defied them. It felt reductive to describe a game as Type C instead of Type F, a process that failed to usefully communicate nuance. We are now so bloody far through that looking glass, and have emerged in a place where it’s the genres themselves that defy classification, where they’ve all become gobbledegook words that mean nothing and can be applied to anything. We wanted to be post-genre, but we’ve instead become post-meaning.</p><p>Why does it matter? Well, because I want to be able to find new point-and-click adventures on Steam, for one thing, and cannot find them buried beneath an avalanche of games that let you use your mouse on the menus. But beyond that, it matters because it’s just more empty cacophony in a world where those with power are trying to destroy any sense of meaning.</p><p>Is there a fix? No, I don’t think so. Sorry, that’s not very satisfying, is it? I think, like vegetation, we’ve just muddled ourselves to the point where we don’t know where we’re supposed to go in the gaming supermarket to find the games we want to consume. It’s too late. We broke it. We’re stuck with some useless nothing now.</p><p>Although, if you want a pithy closer, you could argue the AAA publishers are doing their bit by only investing in open-world action games, soulslikes or hero shooters. That certainly refines things a little.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All eyes in the video game industry are watching to see when Grand Theft Auto 6 will release. The potential impact on the industry is expected to be very large, but several publishers planning to release games around the same time are ready to delay just to get out of its way.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-don-t-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">“We Don’t Want to Be Anywhere Near That”</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Christopher Dring</a> of the recently launched outlet The Game Business, “three major video game publishers” are ready to delay their games to avoid GTA 6. Dring says that the boss “of one of the world’s biggest game publishers” told him: “Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market. We don’t want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles.”</p>



<p>This past weekend at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco, Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson was told by a few developers that they’re “waiting to see what GTA 6 does.” Back in December, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that competing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishers are “waiting as long as possible to commit to their release date.”</a></p>



<p>The launch of GTA 6, tentatively scheduled for October 2025, reportedly isn’t just scaring off major new releases. According to Dring, two developers of “top 10 live-service games” are not planning any significant updates during the GTA 6 launch window. One studio boss reportedly said that they would “nudge” their releases ahead or backwards three weeks just to avoid GTA 6. The studio heads that spoke to Dring spoke of other potential issues, like a crowded schedule of other games trying to avoid GTA 6, but those problems seem preferable than trying to compete with a potentially industry-altering release. However, as one industry consultant noted at GDC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting on GTA 6 only for it to delay could “tank” those developers</a>.</p>



<p>Are game developers perhaps being too cautious of the GTA 6 release, or are they wise to get out of the way? Let us know down in the comments below! Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Ahead of its launch later this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> has overtaken Hollow Knight: Silksong in order to become the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p><p>This was spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sims-rival-inzoi-has-become-the-most-wishlisted-game-on-steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, who monitored data directly from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and third-party websites like SteamDB. Although Hollow Knight: Silksong technically has more followers on Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>, that data shows that over 52,000 people have wishlisted InZoi prior to its March 27 launch, skyrocketing its follower total to over 244,000. That's enough to make it display as the most wishlisted game on Steam. The top five is rounded out, in order, by Hollow Knight: Silksong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JANvRG0ehgs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JANvRG0ehgs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>InZoi is a life sim game that clearly draws inspiration from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/as-the-sims-turns-25-ea-wants-to-embrace-the-series-past/2900-6185/" data-ref-id="2900-6185">series like The Sims</a>. Players can create and customize virtual humans called "Zois," before watching them go about their daily lives. When InZoi comes out this Friday, it'll be part of the Steam Early Access program. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">early-access review of InZoi</a> saw potential in what it played, praising its visuals and customizations, but noted that there's still much to improve regarding gameplay.</p><p>InZoi launches into early access on March 27, so it'll lose that most-wishlisted spot soon. As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> still does not have a release date at this time, it seems bound to retake that top slot on Steam's most wishlisted ranking.</p>

                <p>The GTA modder and superfan who goes by the handle Dark Space caught the attention of fans by recently releasing a playable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-of-gta-6s-map-has-been-brought-into-gta-5-by-a-superfan/1100-6529130/" data-ref-id="1100-6529130">recreation of the Grand Theft Auto 6 map in Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. However, he has announced that he has ceased all work on the project after being struck by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.</p><p>Dark Space created the free-to-download map solely based on the official trailer shots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> and some unverified leaks, then uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. GTA fans who have been feeling deprived of any new information about the upcoming game downloaded the modded map off FiveM en masse. That's when he noticed messages from YouTube about his videos being taken down due to a copyright strike. </p><p>In an explanation video, the creator says that Take-Two requested that his videos be removed, resulting in his first copyright strike. Multiple strikes can result in the termination of an entire channel.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7LmLfJAuR_U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I've also removed the download link to my mod, even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space said in the video. "I think it's smarter to get in front of them than waiting for their email that will never come. To avoid another copyright strike from Take-Two, I'm not going to use any footage from Grand Theft Auto in this video." He went on to explain how he ended up in this situation, giving a brief history of the modding and map-making community for GTA and how they were trying to guess how big the map was going to be in GTA 6.</p><p>"So why did they remove my video and take away my month's income that I spent two months hard to earn? Well, my guess is that the map is a little too accurate," he continued. "They must feel some sort of threat from it existing because they feel that having a playable version of the map to drive around in could ruin the surprise and newness of GTA 6 when it releases."</p><p>That kind of removal request seemed almost inevitable. Former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij recently commented on the frequent takedowns by Take-Two, saying they are "entirely predictable."</p><p dir="ltr">"They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests," he <a href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1883238047015149881" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a> back in January. "The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.) There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released this fall on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. There has not been an announcement date for a PC release but that will likely be coming later.</p>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> nudging toward its one-month anniversary, Capcom has whipped out another showcase, this one detailing the game's first free content update. And while we already had a pretty good idea what to expect thanks to earlier teases and reveals, we've now had the full run-down - including a confirmed 3rd April release on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the monsters, Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 adds Mizutsune, first seen in 2015's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-generations">Monster Hunter Generations</a> and now back to rain bubbly mayhem on unsuspecting players. He'll be available at Hunter Rank 21 and above, and is unlocked by talking to Kanya in the forest. Mizutsune can be farmed to make new Hunter and Palico gear.
</p>
<p>
Players looking for a more significant challenge can also take on Monster Hunter Wilds' first arch-tempered beast - a variant of Rey Dau, who'll be available as part of a limited-time Event Quest running from 30th April to 21st May BST. Players will need to have reached Hunter Rank 50 or above to accept the quest, and can forge the Rey Day (gamma) and Felyne Rey Dau (gamma) armour by gathering sufficient materials.

<p>
Additionally, Title Update 1 introduces big boss Zoh Shia as a farmable monster with its own Hunter and Palico equipment to forge. In order to fight it again after completing story mode, players will need to accept a special quest available at Hunter Rank 50 and above - after which Zoh Shia can be accessed through the Environment Overview screen and during the Wyvern's Wakening in the Ruins of Wyveria.
</p>
<p>
And if you're looking for somewhere to relax inbetween all that hunting, there's some good news: Title Update 1 also brings a new social area known as The Grand Hub. This can be unlocked by talking to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord Hunter, at Rank 16 and above, and provides players will a range of new activities to undertake in their downtime.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a variety of convenient local amenities, it features what appears to be a proper canteen for pre-hunt meals, alongside tables for arm wrestling and a new Barrel Bomb bowling mini-game. Players can unlock useful items and pendants by honing their bowling skills, although it does require Barrel Bowling Vouchers. These can be earned in various ways, Capcom notes, including through login bonuses. And as an added treat, players will occasionally find the so-called Diva offering her song of worship when they visit the hub at night, so they can settle back and enjoy the show.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Once players have unlocked The Grand Hub, the Squad Information Counter will relocate here from the Windward Plains, and it's also the place to find the Arena Counter for Monster Hunter Wilds' new Arena Quests. These see teams of no more than two players competing for the fastest times as they take on monsters using predetermined equipment. Title Update 1 also adds Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests - both available as limited-time Event Quests - that up to four players can tackle using any equipment in order to earn pendants and other rewards.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, The Grand Hub will serve as the focus for Monster Hunter Wilds' new seasonal events, starting with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on 23rd April. This celebration of spring sees The Grand Hub getting a bit of a makeover, alongside festival-specific meals, and various opportunities to obtain new equipment, pop-up camp decorations, gestures, and more.
</p>
<p>
That's it for the big Title Update 1 features, but Capcom still had a little more to share. Once the update arrives, it'll also be possible to change Alma's outfit (and, later, glasses) from the Appearance menu at camp. There'll be a free outfit included, and presuably more to purchase using real money from the Monster Hunter Wilds store. Speaking of which, players can grab a selection of free classic gestures in the store when Title Update 1 arrives, and the previously announced Cosmetic DLC Pack 1 will also be available to download by Premium Deluxe owners and Cosmetic DLC Pass holders. And still in the realm of paid cosmetics, there'll be new pendants to attach to your weapons, and new camp gear options to purchase - including a big old barbecue and giant stuffed bears to lounge around on.
</p>
<p>
To recap, Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 arrives next Friday, 3rd April. And looking further into the future, more Event Quests are promised - with rewards including a lovely flowing scarf - and a smaller update releases at the end of May. This'll introduce an unspecified collaboration with another Capcom game and "other additional features", including a list showing the endemic life you've captured. As for Title Update 2, that's coming this "summer" and, judging by Capcom's teaser trailer, will see the return of water leviathan Lagiacrus.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-drops-on-april-4th-capcom-finally-drop-all-the-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is already one of the best games of the year, but Capcom and the development team have never left Hunters hanging for very long without anything new to do. Just like Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, it looks as though Wilds is going to be well supported after launch, and the first example of that is Title Update 1, which will arrive on April 3rd (PDT) and April 4th (BST) with a host of new things to get your sword into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase | March 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZoCy3F4J_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On April 4th, Hunters can look forward to the game’s first new creature, with the arrival of Mizutsune, the Japanese-inspired dragon-like creature, whose special bubble attacks can fill the battlefield with colour and chaos. It’s a welcome return, and as one of the most beautiful monsters in the series storied roster, expect it to look even more spectacular in Monster Hunter Wilds updated graphics. There will of course be new armour and weapons to be crafted from Mizutsune’s</p>
<p>April 30th will see the arrival of Arch-tempered Rey Dau, a meaner, tougher version of the creature. You have to wonder after all the talk about the game being easier, whether this fight is going to be truly brutal, with the team cranking the difficulty up. I can only hope that’s the case. Heck, I might even fail a mission! There’ll be new armour in the shape of the Rey Dau Gamma and Felyne Rey Dau Gamma armour sets.</p>
<p>Zoh Shia, the game’s biggest boss, will now be available to hunt at Hunter Rank 50, Zoh Shia will also appear during the Wyverns Awakening in Wyveria, and there’ll once more be new armour and weapons to craft from the many many items you’ll be able to farm from them.</p>

<p>Finally, we got a look at the new location The Grand Hub. This is the all-new Gathering Hub, and alongside your hunting-prep, you can get back into arm wrestling and meal times together, both of which make a very welcome return. It’s going to be available once you reach Hunter Rank 16, so if you’ve been there since launch there’ll be no waiting at all! While you’re messing around there’s also a new barrel bowling game, where you can earn in-game rewards to deck your hunter out with.</p>
<p>There’ll be new Arena Quests too, as you now race to achieve the fastest hunt times against hunters from around the world. There’s now a ranking screen where you can see the fastest times posted by the world’s best. There’ll be special pendants and rewards to earn, the rarity of which will increase depending on your ranking. These quests can be undertaken by up to four hunters, or you can bring support hunters with you, so it’s not a solo affair either.</p>
<p>Further improvements include Alma gaining the ability to change her outfit, and even the ability to change her glasses, while classic gestures from the older games will also return, and we got a look at the contents of the first batch of Cosmetic DLC, entitled Pack 1.</p>
<p>The first seasonal event is also coming, with the Celebration of Spring punctuated by the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance, which is due to start on April 23rd, running until the 7th of May with special decorations and equipment available to earn. If you ever took part in the similar events for the previous games, you’ll be able to earn exclusive armour sets that are often amongst the outrageous in the series. We’ll have to see if that continues.</p>
<p>More updates will be on their way, and they’re already touting a Capcom collaboration for the end of May as part of Update Ver.1.011, as well as even more features for us lucky Hunters! </p>
<p>Finally, they announced that the second Title Update will also launch in the summer, presumably bringing even more monsters and quests. The biggest mic drop for the end of today’s feed came in the closing moments with a teaser of Lagiacrus, the lead monster from Monster Hunter Tri (and my favourite monster of all time) who looks to be joining the game in Title Update 2. Happy Hunting indeed!</p>
