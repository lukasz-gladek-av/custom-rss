                <p dir="ltr">March has started off with a bang if you're still roaming the streets of Los Santos in GTA Online. Along with the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/">Enhanced Edition that arrived for PC players</a>, Rockstar Games also launched a new set of missions and released a plethora of additional content. The new missions fall under the name "Oscar Guzman Flies Again," and there are six of them in total. They take place at the infamous McKenzie Field Hangar and see you steal arms deliveries from Oscar's competition.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to get started with these missions and make some serious cash from the McKenzie Hangar, check out the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to start the Oscar Guzman Flies Again Missions in GTA Online</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453986" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453986"></a><figcaption>Oscar Guzman calling to tell us about his new idea</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, PC players need to ensure they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/" data-ref-id="1100-6529782">migrate their GTA Online character</a> correctly before attempting to pick up right where they left off after downloading the Enhanced Edition. This is easily done by selecting the GTA Online in the main menu and then following the prompts to migrate your character(s). This process is permanent, but there's no real reason you don't want to migrate your progress in either Online or Story Mode.</p><p dir="ltr">New players picking up GTA Online for the first time can simply download the Enhanced Edition and create a new character. However, if you're a new player, you'll have to go through a long slog of required tasks and missions before you're able to partake in the Oscar Guzman missions.</p><p dir="ltr">When you're in Los Santos, you can either go to MazeBank Foreclosures on your phone or wait for a call from Oscar Guzman. It's preferable to wait for Oscar to call you so he can properly explain what he wants you to do, but if you visit MazeBank Foreclosures, click on the red "McKenzie Field Hangar" box.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453984"></a><figcaption>Choosing to buy the McKenzie Field Hangar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From here, go to the northern side of Los Santos, find the property's blue icon, and elect to purchase the property for $1.475 million.

This is quite a drive from downtown Los Santos, but you can simply reload your server to instantly go to the location.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you arrive at the hangar, hop out inside and Oscar will greet you. He'll explain that he's happy you bought the property and goes over his plans for what you're going to do. After a brief conversation, you're led inside to the office where you can register as a CEO on the laptop on the desk. With that done, you can accept the first job in the Oscar Guzman Flies Again missions, which is called "Up and Running."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453985" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453985"></a><figcaption>Speaking with Oscar Guzman at the hangar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You've now officially begun your first of six missions for Oscar Guzman in GTA Online. Up and Running doesn't take too long, but it can be difficult as a solo player, so if you have some friends or want to open up your party, that's recommended.

            <p>
Dotemu and Guard Crush Games, the studios behind 2020's widely acclaimed beat 'em up sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, are teaming up again for something a little bit different: Absolum, a fantasy themed side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like elements that's launching this year.
</p>
<p>
Absolum aims to combine "thrilling arcade beat 'em up action" with "intricate, refined combat" to create what Dotemu is describing as a "rogue 'em up". There's talk of quests, branching pathways, NPCs, unlockable items, permanent warrior upgrades, and combinable character skills - all in a fantasy adventure channeling the spirit of classic brawlers including Golden Axe.
</p>
<p>
Absolum's action plays out across Talamh, a world of wonder and cosmic horrors gripped by warfare following a cataclysmic magical event. That's where the game's four-strong band of rebels comes in, all setting out on an epic quest to oppose the Sun King Azra and liberate Talamh after they're imbued with powerful magic.

<p>
All four rebels are playable (either solo or co-operatively) and feature their own unique skill set and personality, with two having been revealed so far. There's Galandra, for instance - an agile, sword-clad fighter designed to excel in close-quarters combat - while Karl is a tanklike dwarf armed with devastating punches and a rifle that can bring down opponents from afar.
</p>
<p>
"Absolum blends arcade-like melee combat with spells, counters, upgradable abilities and uniquely powerful playable fighters," explains Dotemu, "hosting a grand, high-stakes quest across an array of hand-crafted stages." Those stages - and Absolum's striking visual style - have been brought to life by the artists and animators at animation studio Supamonks.
</p>
<p>
Absolum doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">via Steam</a>) sometime later this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Rockstar has released the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V PC update</a>, which the developer dubbed GTA V Enhanced. This free update is effectively a new version of the game, as you can check in your Steam or Epic Games Store library, where the previous version is now labeled as GTA V Legacy. The distinction makes sense, as the new version has much higher system requirements compared to the original version.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 10 (latest service pack)<br>
Processor: Intel Core i7-4770 | AMD FX-9590<br>
Memory: 8 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 (4GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6400 (4GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: DirectX 10 Compatible<br>
Additional Notes: SSD Required |*Compatible PC and/or device required. 3D Audio via Windows Spatial Sound compatible audio systems</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 11<br>
Processor: Intel Core i5-9600K | AMD Ryzen 5 3600<br>
Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (8GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6600XT (8GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: Windows Spatial Sound-compatible audio system; solution containing Dolby Atmos support required for a Dolby Atmos experience<br>
Additional Notes: SSD with DirectStorage compatibility</p>
<p>It's also important to make sure your configuration is up for it since progress can be copied from the Legacy version once, and while you will be able to continue playing from where you left off in GTA V Legacy, progress cannot be copied back. This goes for both Story Mode and GTA Online progress, including Characters, GTA$, Progression, Stats, Vehicles, Properties, Weapons, Clothing, and Player-Created Jobs.</p>
<p>Let's review the bulk of the new features available in GTA V Enhanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing support, including reflections and shadows (previously released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) and the PC-exclusive global illumination and ambient occlusion</li>
<li>Upscaling support for AMD FSR 1 and 3 and NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>Faster load times powered by DirectStorage support</li>
<li>Enhanced 3D audio with support for Dolby Atmos (for those with compatible sound systems) and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers feature, which is enabled to let the player feel directional damage, weather effects, rough road surfaces, explosions, and more</li>
<li>General optimization</li>
</ul>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>First things first. Rockstar still didn't add support for High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) displays, which is underwhelming in 2025. The NVIDIA App does not recognize the new version yet, and therefore, tweaking the ApplicationStorage.json file to implement the new DLSS 4 transformer models is not possible. At least Rockstar added built-in support for DLAA, which can be selected directly in-game.</p>
<p>Each ray tracing setting (shadows, reflections, global illumination, and ambient occlusion) can be individually enabled and set up to Ultra. There's also an extra setting called Scene BVH Quality, which maxes out at Very High. Those are the only new settings in the graphics menu. For the testing on my rig (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition), I pushed every setting to the max, including High-Resolution Shadows and Extended Shadows Distance.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA V Enhanced 4K DLAA RT Maxed Gameplay - RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cMF8tgUvrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After jumping into the game, the visual upgrade over the vanilla version of Grand Theft Auto V was immediately clear. By far the two most impactful enhancements are ray traced global illumination and reflections, which literally elevate the graphics of most scenes to an entirely new level of fidelity. Of course, when you look closely, you can still see that the models and textures are from a relatively old game. For that, you'll need to use mods, though that might only fly for the single-player mode now that Rockstar has <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the kernel-level anti-cheat BattlEye to combat cheating in GTA Online.</p>
<p>Still, there's no doubt that GTA V Enhanced is the best the game has ever looked. On the aforementioned rig, the game also runs smoothly, even without Frame Generation (which should be added in a future update, said Rockstar), reaching 123 average frames per second in a free-roaming session of around 20 minutes. Support for NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation could potentially triple this result. I would be particularly interested in bumping these 1% low and 0.1% Low to get a more consistent experience, though.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-04-224951-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>GTA V Enhanced is definitely a way to entice players to get back into the game just as GTA VI looms on the horizon, but one could also take it as a positive sign for the next game's PC version, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch sooner than expected in early 2026. Support for modern features like ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS/AMD FSR (and soon Frame Generation), Dolby Atmos, and the DualSense controller is a step in the right direction for a developer that has too often relegated PC users to second-class citizens, as evidenced by the huge delay of this 'Next-Gen' update compared to consoles.</p>
<p>However, there's still work to do. For example, whether you own the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store, you still need to pass through the dreaded Rockstar Games Launcher and this affects the DLSS version, too, since the Launcher replaces the DLSS file with the default version if you've updated it to a newer one. Thankfully, there's already a mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/gta5/mods/1199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on the Nexus</a> that monitors the GTA V Enhanced process and replaces the DLSS file automatically when the game is started, restoring it to the original upon quitting the game. This is exactly the kind of stuff that annoys PC gamers; Rockstar should take note for GTA VI.</p>

During a broadcast last week, Piker suggested that if House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans were as serious about Medicare and Medicaid fraud as they claim, they would “kill Rick Scott,” a current senator and former CEO who oversaw what <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2003/June/03_civ_386.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Department of Justice called</a> “the largest health care fraud case in US history,” instead of elevating him to the upper echelons of the party. This is notable not because of Piker’s suspension, but because of how people – especially other content creators – ended up framing the larger issue.</p><p>Not long after Piker made his incendiary statement last week, the outrage machine kicked into overdrive, with the likes of <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/libs-tiktok/bomb-threats-follow-libs-tiktoks-campaign-against-planet-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actual-violence-encourager Libs of TikTok</a> and rebranded <em>WoW </em>streamer Asmongold – who unsurprisingly <a href="https://x.com/gremloe/status/1890592255947190624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did <em>not </em>turn over a new leaf</a> following his own suspension for <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2024 racist rant against Palestinians</a> – <a href="https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1895556175284036051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clutching</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oqp5_ZYLXs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their pearls</a> at what they suggested was a violent threat against Scott. Numerous others across Twitter and YouTube – some connected to <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a longer-term effort to deplatform Piker and other pro-Palestine streamers</a>, others not –&nbsp; took up their cause, and Twitch suspended Piker a few days later.</p><p>After just one day, Piker’s suspension has concluded, and other usual suspects like Tim Pool are <a href="https://x.com/Timcast/status/1896982287692259588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acting like</a> Twitch is turning a blind eye to murder. Never mind that even Piker did not suggest viewers should harm Scott. He remarked that Johnson and other high-ranking Republicans <em>would </em>do it if they stood by their stated principles, an idea so far outside the realm of possibility as to be on its face absurd.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="i got cancelled." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmzLMjCbLXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"My statement was hyperbolic,” Piker said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmzLMjCbLXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a YouTube video</a> addressing the suspension today. “But the intention of it was not a call to violence directly against a sitting senator, but instead was to show the hypocrisy of the Republican party in terms of how little they truly care about Medicare and Medicaid fraud – because that happens at the point of the provider and not necessarily at the point of the recipients. They want to cut Medicare and Medicaid for the recipients <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/medicaid-cover-congress-proposed-budget-cuts-felt-rcna193897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the tune of $800 billion</a>, and in order to justify that they will do everything in their power to lie and claim that it's actually your grandparents that are stealing from Medicare, and not people like Rick Scott."</p><p>Piker, who back in 2019 found himself in hot water over <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-suspends-popular-leftist-streamer-after-controve-1837518859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a similarly de-contextualized remark</a> that America “deserved 9/11,” resolved to use “more deliberate and more careful language” in the future. Probably a smart move, though as Piker observed in his video, nobody is going to be perfect 100 percent of the time when they’re live day in and day out, going back and forth with a contentious chat. All the while, creators espousing right-wing viewpoints – which often explicitly or implicitly advocate for violence against immigrants and trans people – are <a href="https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held to vastly different standards</a>.</p><p>Also, more importantly, the streamer drama portion of this story barely matters! The problem Piker pointed to during the stream that got him suspended – a former CEO of a healthcare company that copped a record $1.7 billion in fines going on to dodge material consequences, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article288431251.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk away with $10 million in severance and $300 million in stock options</a>, and become a US senator – is an issue of so much more consequence than Piker's word choice that these things are not remotely comparable. It is deranged that millions of people are getting their news from creators who act like a damn Twitch streamer using harsh language to state documented facts is where this story starts and ends, rather than in the halls of actual power.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re all being robbed. It’s as clear as day. There was <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an (alleged) murder about it</a>, and many people <a href="https://aftermath.site/awesome-games-done-quick-speedrun-luigi-skyrim-zelda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sided with the (alleged) murderer</a>. Think about why political pundits and content creators might now be incentivized to muddy the waters, especially where healthcare is concerned. Think about how they might stand to benefit from your distraction, even as normal people’s material circumstances <a href="https://thehill.com/business/5175396-trump-tariffs-economic-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degrade by the day</a>. Think about how platforms make themselves complicit by algorithmically favoring outrage and drama dogpiles over discussion that threatens the status quo. Anybody who frames this conflict in any other way – who suggests different stakes or a different central cast of characters – is either deeply unserious or outright lying to you. Do not listen to them. Odds are, they’re trying to rob you too.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/deliver-at-all-costs-demo"><h3>Deliver At All Costs Is *CRASH* A Great *SMASH* Demo *HOUSE FALLS DOWN*</h3></a><p>Yeah yeah I'll finish the first mission, right after I *DRIVES THROUGH GAS STATION*</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible"><h3>Gundam GQuuuuuuX Is The Sum Of Its Parts In The Best Way Possible</h3></a><p>The new Mobile Suit Gundam is FLCL, Pokémon, and a hint of Evangelion</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Quick, to the training sphere!</h2>
<p>The Big Brother announcement promised the ability to "interact with everything" and "disable and destroy intrusive tele-screens and spy cameras watching the player's every move" across "10 square blocks of Orwell's retro-futuristic world." But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fdgCQOEY4M">footage from the demo</a> falls well short of that promise, instead covering some extremely basic <em>Riven</em>-style puzzle gameplay (flips switches to turn on the power; use a screwdriver to open the grate, etc.) played from a first-person view.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fdgCQOEY4M?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p>
      Sample gameplay from the newly unearthed&nbsp;<em>Big Brother</em> demo.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>It all builds up to a sequence where (according to a walk-through included on the demo disc) you have to put on a "zero-g suit" before planting a bomb inside a "zero gravity training sphere" guarded by robots. Sounds like inhabiting the world of the novel to us!</p>
<p>Aside from the brief mentions of the Thought Police and MiniPac, the short demo does include a few other incidental nods to its licensed source material, including a "WAR IS PEACE" propaganda banner and an animated screen with the titular Big Brother seemingly looking down on you. Still, the entire gameplay scenario is so far removed from anything in the actual <em>1984</em> novel to make you wonder why they bothered with the license in the first place. Of course, MediaX answers that question in the game's announcement, predicting that "while the game stands on its own as an entirely new creation in itself and will attract the typical game audience, the 'Big Brother' game will undoubtedly also attract a large literary audience."</p>
<p>We sadly never got the chance to see how that "large literary audience" would have reacted to a game that seemed poised to pervert both the name and themes of <em>1984</em> so radically. In any case, this demo can now sit alongside the release of 1984's <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Fahrenheit_451_1984"><em>Fahrenheit 451</em></a> and 1992's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gthdLbrJspQ"><em>The Godfather: The Action Game</em></a> on any list of the most questionable game adaptations of respected works of art.</p>

			<p>Acclaim was once an incredibly important company within the games industry, and it soon became legendary after being founded in 1987 for helping to publish titles such as Mortal Kombat, Turok, and NBA Jam. After more than two decades, Acclaim is making a return and has come back with a bold and brave mission in the face of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">tumultuous industry</a>.</p>
<p>The publisher is making a comeback with a focus on supporting indie developers, as well as helping to reignite beloved classic franchises. In this, Acclaim will provide the necessary resources which includes funding, marketing and PR support to independent studios that otherwise wouldn't have been given the opportunity to do so in a highly saturated and chaotic market.</p>
<p>One of the main goals Acclaim will have going forward is to resurrect some classic IP out there that has been enjoyed over the years by a global audience. To be able to make this work, Acclaim has assembled an advisory board with some of the most esteemed industry leaders, such as Russell Binder at Striker Entertainment, Mark Caplan at Ridge Partners, and Jeff Jarrett at Global Force Entertainment.</p>
<p>To ensure the longevity of the company going forward, Acclaim has key partners in Phil Toronto, Partner at VaynerFund, and Eric Vogel, Partner at JET Management, which will help the publishing company foster a healthy investment environment for everyone involved.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," says two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarret. "From my early involvement with the publisher's 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>In addition to these industry legends, Alex Josef is spearheading the relaunch of Acclaim as CEO, an industry veteran who has over two decades of experience in marketing and game publishing across PC, console, and mobile.</p>
<p>"It's an absolute honor and pleasure to be leading the charge in bringing Acclaim back to the forefront of the games industry," said Alex Josef. "We're fortunate that we have an extremely talented team and that we've already signed some incredible indie titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>
<p>The website for Acclaim has its missions at the forefront, as well as a tab for <a href="https://playacclaim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its games</a>, which will be coming soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/two-point-museum-interview-devs-pc-typo-new-features-1851767715<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/two-point-museum&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/two-point-museum"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a></span>—available now on PC and consoles—is the third game in the <em>Two Point</em> franchise. The wacky sim series started off with <em>Two Point Hospital</em> in 2018 and then leaped to colleges and universities in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/two-point-campus-hospital-game-pass-review-pc-sim-1849397889&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/two-point-campus-hospital-game-pass-review-pc-sim-1849397889">2022's <em>Two Point Campus</em></a></span><em>.</em> Now, players are able to build their own wild and weird museums in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/two-point-museum-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-sim-tycoon-1851766450&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/two-point-museum-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-sim-tycoon-1851766450"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p>And after spending over 40 hours with the game, I talked to Ben Huskins, design director at Two Point Studios, about this latest entry. We discussed why the team went with museums, how they researched the topic, the new features they are excited about and also, if they too struggle with spelling “museum” accurately.</p><p>According to Huskins, spelling museum wrong became a “running joke” in the studio during development. </p><p>“Lead Designer Luke is a big fan of ‘musuem’ – we think he’s trying to push for the word to be officially updated in the dictionary,” said Huskins. “Throughout development, we’ve been discovering a wonderful smorgasbord of museum typos in every nook and cranny of the game. It’s particularly amusing as our trailer ends up with the line <em>‘You can’t spell museum without u and me... um...’</em> Turns out we can’t spell museum full stop.” </p><p>While the devs might have struggled with spelling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-love-animal-crossing-new-horizons-museum-1842798339&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-love-animal-crossing-new-horizons-museum-1842798339">museum</a></span> right, they nailed making a great game about these places dedicated to history and knowledge. </p><p>But I was curious as to why the team decided to go with museums for the third entry in the first place. While it defiantly worked out, a museum sim wouldn’t have been my first choice after <em>Campus </em>and <em>Hospital</em>. According to Huskins, the team wanted to make a game about creation, exploration, and discovery, and once they started talking about museums they were “inspired by the possibilities.” </p><p>“Something that’s great about museums is they all have completely unique collections of exhibits,” said Huskins. </p><p>“We thought it would be great to allow players to build up their own unique collections, with every player finding different things. The expedition system felt like it would give us this wonderful sense of adventure, allowing you to choose where you want to explore, and then adding that sense of excitement and anticipation about what you might discover. Then, as your collection grows, we wanted you to have complete creative freedom to decide how to lay out your museum, and to craft an awe-inspiring and educational experience for visitors.”</p><p>And while the museums you build in<em> Two Point</em> are filled with strange and cartoonish exhibits, like giant man-eating plants and ghosts, the team still did a lot of research to figure out how real <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-wish-more-games-had-museums-like-modern-warfare-2-1842777431&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-wish-more-games-had-museums-like-modern-warfare-2-1842777431">museums</a></span> work. </p><p>“We spoke to several people who work in museums. We even got a few behind-the-scenes tours, which were amazing,” explained Huskins. </p><p>“There are so many different roles involved in running a museum, everything from the people designing the exhibition spaces to the technicians looking after the exhibits. There was no way we could represent them all in the game, but there are so many little features we added based on these conversations.”</p><figure id="" data-id="430ff2eda5afa4bed2a72fdef9d7e30a" data-recommend-id="image://430ff2eda5afa4bed2a72fdef9d7e30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Two Point Studios / Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="430ff2eda5afa4bed2a72fdef9d7e30a" data-recommend-id="image://430ff2eda5afa4bed2a72fdef9d7e30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For example, the director told me that staff-only doors were one such feature they added based on museum research. They also discovered that many museums in the real world categorize visitors in to “various personas” such as thrill-seekers and explorer. This helped guide how the game handles digital guests and their  preferences.  </p><p>And some of these guests are vampires and aliens. Yet, like the other <em>Two Point</em> games, <em>Museum </em>perfectly balances real-world details, like having to manage your staff’s pay and build restrooms for guests, alongside these outlandish aspects that are only possible in a video game. According to Huskins this is a key pillar of the <em>Two Point</em> formula.</p><p>“Having that juxtaposition is important for us – if everything is absurd, then nothing feels absurd, so we like to have that contrast,” said Huskins. </p><p>“Of course, we’re also trying to design a game with a lot of depth to the simulation. We’re not specifically trying to model reality, far from it, but we take some inspiration from real world organizations, then distill it down into something easier to understand. Ultimately, our priority is fun, so we’ll pick and choose the elements that give us the depth and the variety we want, whilst keeping the game approachable and lighthearted.”</p><p><em>Two Point Museum</em> is out now digitally on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There were video games and arcade hits before Pac-Man, but Namco's ghost-gobbling hero quickly became a pop-culture icon after his debut in May 1980. Pac-Man's 45th anniversary is now just over two months away, but Bandai Namco has plans to keep the party going into 2026.</p><p>To start off the year of "imPACt," Bandai Namco released the following video that tracks Pac-Man over the last four decades, including the original game and its Atari 2600 port, as well as some of the sequels and spin-offs including Pac-Man World 2. There's even a very brief glimpse of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-reimagined-as-a-hollow-knight-inspired-2d-action-platformer-shadow-labyrinth/1100-6528429/" data-ref-id="1100-6528429">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, the upcoming title that reinvents the Pac-Man franchise as a 2D action game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrpS9vcBefQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DrpS9vcBefQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Shadow Labyrinth may be the biggest Pac-Man game on the horizon, but it's not the only one. Bandai Namco is teaming up with Supersocial on Roblox for Pac-Man Simulator, which will let players have more Pac-Man adventures centered around the 45th anniversary. Meanwhile, PowerA has Pac-Man gaming accessories in the works for Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. And we've already seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pac-man-plushies-are-launching-in-celebration-of-the-landmark-arcade-games-45th-anniversary/1100-6528317/" data-ref-id="1100-6528317">some of the Pac-Man plushies</a> that are coming as well.</p><p>If you've ever wanted to play as Pac-Man in real life, Manchester's Arcade Arena in the United Kingdom is launching the Pac-Man Live Experience on March 22. This collaboration between Little Lion Entertainment and Bandai Namco allows visitors to step into life-sized versions of Pac-Man's iconic maze.</p><p>From April 30-June 4, Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture is hosting a special Pac-Man display, which will have a themed event on May 10. Additionally, The Great Park Gallery in Irvine, California is also going to have a Pac-Man retrospective exhibition with special programing of its own from May 18-September 28.</p><p>Club America will get in on the fun with a limited run of Pac-Man-branded soccer jerseys. There will also be new Pac-Man toys and apparel, and even a Pac-Man cooking book from Insight Editions later in 2025. Bandai Namco is also partnering with the Red Cross for a blood drive program through Pac-Man's "Make ImPACt" campaign. More details about that will be shared later this year.</p>

            <p>
Three years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s Expanded &amp; Enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the game's next-gen features have - just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-gets-new-pc-version-that-adds-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-features-for-free">Rockstar promised last month</a> - finally made the jump to PC in a free update for all existing users.
</p>
<p>
From today, Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy (as the original PC version is now being referred to) has been delisted from PC store fronts to make way for GTA 5 Enhanced. And as per <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/7551a7k917554a/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-now-available">Rockstar's announcement</a>, this new edition introduces a range of features, including new vehicles, new ambient wildlife, and support for Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service.
</p>
<p>
It also adds new graphics options, including the ray traced shadows and reflections first introduced on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, alongside other additions - such as ambient occlusion and global illumination - exclusive to PC. That's in addition to support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates, as well as AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS support - with Frame Generation support coming at a later date.

<p>
Elsewhere, DualSense controller owners can now use its adaptive triggers during gameplay, and Rockstar is also touting faster loading times via SSD and DirectStorage, as well as enhanced audio - including Dolby Atmos, and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music.
</p>
<p>
And for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">Grand Theft Auto Online</a> players, the updated PC version gets kernel-based anti-cheat protections and proactive voice chat moderation, as well as the lies of new vehicles, Chameleon Paints, and high-performance mods from Hao's Special Works. 
</p>
<p>
All this comes with a higher set of minimum and recommended PC specifications, but anyone unable to meet those increased demands can still access Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy via the game's launcher. Be aware, though, the two versions are considered entirely separate, meaning friends will all need to be using the same version if they want to play together. Additionally, it's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/89953o1153a39a/pre-load-the-free-grand-theft-auto-v-pc-upgrade-now">necessary to migrate Story Mode and Online progress to the new edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
To coincide with the launch of GTA 5 Enchanced, Rockstar is discounting the game by 50 percent on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/grand-theft-auto-v">Epic</a> store, bringing the price down to £14.99 until 20th March.
</p>
<p>
All this PC activity comes as Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">prepares to release GTA 6 this autumn</a> - although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">publisher Take-Two has hinted the PC version won't arrive until later</a>. That tallies with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recent claims by accessories company Corsair Gaming</a>, which suggested the PC release isn't due until "early 2026".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-players-can-win-1-million-in-this-2025s-the-hunt-mega-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of things most people would be willing to do for $1 million, and now they can add taking part in Roblox's The Hunt: Mega Edition when the event starts on March 13. Cash hungry hopefuls will need to play their way through more than 24 different Roblox games to compete against other players to prove their skills. If they make it into the top ten competitors, they'll be invited to Roblox HQ in California and take part in a live-streamed final, where one will take home $1 million dollars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are smaller prizes like "ultra-rare digital items" up for grabs and the event is open to anyone, but you have to be over 13 to be eligible for the big cash jackpot. The event is set to run until March 24 to find its top ten players, with the live-streamed final planned for some time in April. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've yet to dip your toe in the vast Roblox ocean of games and experiences, there's still time to start and get some practice in before The Hunt: Mega Edition goes live. We don't know every title that will be part of the contest yet, but the following are confirmed. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rivals - Nosiny Games</li><li>SpongeBob Tower Defense - Wonder Works Studio</li><li>Basketball Legends - InfinitySports</li><li>IT GIRL - IT GIRL Magazine</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hunt: First Edition launched last year and according to Roblox, saw 34 million users spend 128 million hours completing 212 million quests, and that event didn't even come with "buy your own yacht" kind of money. The event involved every part of the Roblox community with 100 creator teams crafting quests specifically for The Hunt, and Roblox influencers putting together special live streams for competitors and spectators.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As you might have guessed from the name, Marvel Rivals’ Clone Rumble mode removes hero limits by asking each team to choose a single hero to play as. That means the dream to see a 6v6 match between a full lobby of Mister Fantastics will be fully realized come launch on March 7, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clone Rumble’s debut trailer teases how players can experiment with new strategies. We know 12 Reed Richards will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-stretching-mister-fantastics-meme-potential-to-its-limit">open the door for some hilarious clips</a>, but the mode will also allow players to turn maps into a greenhouse with a team of Groots. You’ll also be able to make Marvel Rivals look more like Call of Duty if your teams pick Punisher as their chosen clone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have taken to social media to discuss the other possibilities, too, including what it might look like to use Doctor Strange in the mode. Although Marvel Rivals’ Sorcerer Supreme likely won’t be able to completely pollute arenas with portals, there’s no telling how Loki, Captain America, and Peni Parker matches will play out.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“We still have time to capture the point, there is over a minute left on the clock.”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”“</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!” <a href="https://t.co/ZB1UDDzsfG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/ZB1UDDzsfG</a> <a href="https://t.co/Lh36Xd94ha" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Lh36Xd94ha</a></p></div>— Ultima (@UltimaShadowX) <a href="https://twitter.com/UltimaShadowX/status/1896956534871167255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PC players when all 12 Doctor Strange’s open a portal <a href="https://t.co/2Nh8uWovI1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/2Nh8uWovI1</a> <a href="https://t.co/NimPjFf5hC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NimPjFf5hC</a></p>— PridefulSin🫧 (@ReignOfPride) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReignOfPride/status/1896967030861078530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s Clone Rumble trailer is the reveal of a new Western costume for Black Widow, which may also come with what appears to be a cowboy-inspired MVP animation.

The activity will see Marvel Rivals players rolling dice to move a game piece across a board to collect more in-game rewards, including Units and other customization options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how long Clone Rumble and Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure will be available to players after they launch this week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-xbox-beta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Amazing Seasun Games has announced that the Mecha BREAK Beta is now available on the Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>The announcement comes following the Beta launch on Steam last week, which saw the game become the most played demo on the platform with over 317,000 concurrent players. </p>



<p>As tweeted on X (formerly Twitter), Amazing Seasun Games will be rewarding Xbox players for their patience with 2000 Corite credits. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Greetings Pilots! We’re happy to announce the Xbox build of our Open Beta Test is now LIVE!

To thank you for your patience, we will be giving each Xbox player 2000 Corite so you can jump right into the action.</span></p></article></div>



<p>What’s particularly interesting though, is despite the game being scheduled to release on PC, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5, a beta for the PS5 is yet to be announced.</p>



<p>When one user asked when will the PlayStation Beta come, the official account replied, “We look forward to bringing Mecha BREAK to PlayStation later this year.”</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on why the game has yet to announce a PlayStation 5 Beta, but Insider Gaming has asked Amazing Seasun Games for comment on when, or if, one will be release. However, it is known that Mecha BREAK does have console exclusivity with Xbox for a limited time.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the the Mecha BREAK Beta has yet to be given an end date either.</p>



<p>Will you be playing the Mecha BREAK Beta? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
