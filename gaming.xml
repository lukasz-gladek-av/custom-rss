            <p>Gotcha Gotcha Games, creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rpg-maker">RPG Maker</a> series, have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/action-game-maker">Action Game Maker</a>. Much like its predecessors, it aims to allow users to create games in its chosen genre without any programming experience, using a “node-based visual scripting system” (draggable arrows and concepts, basically). Could this finally be the opportunity to create the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? No, of course not. The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it's not an action game. Also, I don't know how to make games. Also it's Friday and I'm tired. Also, AGM isn't out yet. Still, I’m intrigued!</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a>-facts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Advanced Engine Technology With Godot Engine!</p>
<p>Take advantage of the excellent 2D functionality provided by Godot Engine, the popular open source engine powering ACTION GAME MAKER!</p>
<ul>
<li>UI design based on the existing Godot UI</li>
<li>Support for GDScript is provided for those who want to move beyond visual scripting.</li>
<li>A complete 2D pipeline</li>
<li>Tile Map Editor with auto-tile function</li>
<li>Supports both sprite and 2D bone animation systems</li>
<li>Access to Godot's rich particle and shader systems as well as support for dynamic lighting and shadows, enabling a full suite of graphics features!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The toolkit ships with “everything you need to build your first game" from "character art to tiles, music, and sound effects!" What's more, “if you already have your own assets it’s easy to import them – and high resolutions are supported!”</p>
<p>My immediate thought here is whether the tools are going to robust enough to offer as wide an array of projects as RPG Maker? Everyone’s got a story to tell, but does everyone have a distinctive double jump to unleash on the world? Are we going to get action-y equivalents of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lisa">Lisa: The Painful</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-to-the-moon">To The Moon</a>? Will I cave and settle for a lesser version of the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? Anything is possible, it seems, as long as it involves chaining verbs together. RPG Maker XP, by the by, is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/235900/RPG_Maker_XP/">90% off on Steam</a>, although it has been cheaper than that in the past by a good 10%. You can find Action Game Maker on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987180/ACTION_GAME_MAKER/">here</a>, release date TBC.</p>

            <p>
Three Starfy games previously only available in Japan have been added to Nintendo Switch Online for Expansion members.
</p>
<p>
Densetsu no Starfy 1, 2 and 3 were all released on the Game Boy Advance between 2002 and 2004, but are now available globally on Switch. A fourth game came to Nintendo DS in 2006, which was followed by The Legendary Starfy on the same console - the only game in the series to be released outside of Japan, until now.
</p>
<p>
So who is Starfy? As one comment on X put it: "He's like Kirby, but a starfish". Makes sense.
</p>

<p>

The Starfy games are platformers with underwater worlds, which also makes sense considering Starfy is a starfish. He's also the prince of Pufftop, which is maybe why these games were Japan only.
</p>
<p>
Smash Bros. fans may recognise Starfy as an assist trophy, though. He's appeared in each game since Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the Wii with a handy spin attack.
</p>
<p>
His <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Starfy">trophy data</a> also provides some more background information: "He's a bit spacey and clumsy, but when he sets his mind to something, he gives it his all". He also "sometimes dons a pig suit and throws pork cutlets".

Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process. We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game. We will continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre.”</blockquote><p>Generally speaking, The First Descendant is a mash-up of mechanics from various looter shooters already in the market. There’s more than a whiff of Destiny about The First Descendant’s design, systems, and mechanics, but then there’s also a lot of Warframe about it, too.</p><p>This week, Nexon released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does">a significant update for The First Descendant</a> that makes some big changes to the game, and leaves some aspects of it that had become a topic of discussion within the community well alone.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review">The First Descendant review</a> returned a 5/10. We said: “The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

I remember seeing my name in the credits of a Nintendo game for the first time.

This was one of the Professor Layton games by Level-5. Nintendo of Europe handled the localization and publishing for the Layton series at the time.

They have yet to be credited for their work on Nintendo titles through Localsoft and claim they also worked on Nintendo projects at Keywords—where they also failed to receive a credit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I kind of accepted [miscrediting] as 'part of the business' but that doesn’t mean it's fair or right. The fact that these companies are not able to give any reasonable explanation for omitting external translators (and even developers) from their credits is proof of this, I think" they continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Professionally, it's hard to tell how much this has impacted me. It's entirely possible that more translation agencies would have approached me if my name was out there in all these big blockbuster Nintendo games, but who knows?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those claims were corroborated by another source, who spent over a year working on multiple Nintendo projects at Localsoft but haven't been credited. "It is Nintendo's policy to not list the name of translators from external agencies in their game credits, which also forbids us from listing those titles on our CVs," explained our source.</span></p><p>A robust list of credits for the NOA localization team in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.

"That's how it always goes," they continued. "The agencies and the clients just play the blame game endlessly.

"There's a very perceptible 'don't tell' mentality in this line of work," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After realizing they hadn't been credited for their work, they admitted to being "upset but not surprised." On a personal level, being miscredited prevented them from telling friends and family about their work. It was, they said, incredibly demoralizing. On a professional level, the impact was more insidious.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I felt I would benefit from being able to state I worked on the title when offering my services to new clients.

		<p>Lidia Sobieska is going to be available for Tekken 8 from July 22nd, Bandai Namco has confirmed. That date is for those players who have the Playable Character Year 1 Pass. Her official release date for everyone else is July 25th. A new trailer has been released to show Lidia in action, with The Warrior Prime Minister doling out the damage using her traditional karate skills.</p>
<p><iframe title="TEKKEN 8 — Lidia Sobieska Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ne4AF6E-PHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lidia is the second character from the Playable Character Year 1 Pass, following Eddy Gordo. Her introduction also sees the addition of the new Seaside Resort stage will be added to the game giving players a nice beach setting to get your fight on. Both Eddy and Lidia were leaked ahead of their official announcements, and if the leak is 100% spot on, the remaining characters for the Year 1 pass are Craig Marduk and Fahkumram.</p>

<p>In our Tekken 8 review, Nick wrote,<em>&nbsp;“Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as Street Fighter 6, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time. “</em></p>

            <p>Kain is merchandised. The clans sell tales of him. Few know the truth. He was a character in a dead franchise once, as we were we all. However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/706736940?ref=e9g0rc&amp;token=21dc992b">crowdfunding allowing</a>) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ode-to-kain-from-blood-omen-and-his-legacy-including-untitled-goose-game">precisely once</a>. You’re goddamn right I’m going to froth at the mouth at even the vague promise of more Shakespearean monologues and time-travelling vampires.</p>

<p>Ok, so I’ll dial back on the frothing. The Dead Shall Rise looks gorgeous, absolutely no complaints there. Any reservations I have are in the monkeys paw of getting more Legacy Of Kain media at the cost of fleshing out a chunk of the timeline that I always felt worked better as an unknown. The story, which has been written in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics, aims to focus on aspects of Raziel’s human past, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-returns-in-new-prequel-graphic-novel">via IGN</a>. As I say, I’m left both intrigued and cautious. Not that I don’t think the writers won’t do a great job, just that so much of Soul Reaver’s strength lie in letting the player fill in the gaps in Raziel’s past for themselves. Never getting to see Kain’s empire at its height of power, for example, always felt like a deliberate choice rather than a lacking omission. There’s something to be said to filling in the literal cracks in Nosgoth’s corpse for yourself.</p>
<p>None of this, I’m sure, will stop me devouring the book like so many wayward souls haunting the spectral realm. The real question here, of course, is what this might mean for the Legacy Of Kain franchise going forward. In 2018, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/legacy-of-kain-devs-crystal-dynamics-seek-opinions-about-new-games-in-the-series">put out a survey</a> asking fans about what they’d like to see from the future of the long-dormant series. I remember it well, because one of the questions was something along the lines of “what games should any new Legacy Of Kain titles be like?” to which I responded “Legacy Of Kain”, which felt so obvious I wonder why they asked it. Anyway, I’d say this new comic bodes well, although only time will tell if it’s anywhere near as brilliant as <a href="https://youtu.be/OCZXvblpNSM">this </a>wonderful tale of Kain discovering Raziel making chocolate pudding at an ungodly hour.</p>

			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO announced the release date of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 remake. The game will be released digitally on October 24 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>It is a remake of 2001's PlayStation 2 game with Power Up Kit features, the "All Officers Play" and "All Periods Scenarios" features, and a host of new content. There are now a thousand playable officers, up from 600, while the All Periods Scenarios feature now offers 55 scenarios (some of which are fictional), the most ever in the franchise.</p>
<p>Through the enhanced "All Officers Play" feature, players will be able to take control of the powerful rulers and the officers who serve them or be a free officer and join a roving army. This allows players to explore the Three Kingdoms with a fresh and unique experience every time, thanks to the new features and the variety of associations formed both on and off the battlefield, highlighted by "Symbiotic" and "Antagonistic" relationships.</p>
<p>"Symbiotic" relationships are formed when the player interacts with other officers through situations such as commands or events, and a certain number of "sympathies" occur. When a player is in a "symbiotic" relationship with another officer, the officer will join and help the player in many situations, including domestic tasks, councils, and battles. On the other hand, if the relationship is "Antagonistic," the officer will not accept visits from the player and may even hunt them on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The variety of relationships built throughout Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 remake will now be dramatically on display. Players will be able to monitor the ever-changing dynamics of each relationship through the Relationship Chart, which not only displays relationships such as "Sworn Siblings" and "Spouses," but also special relationships such as "Destined Partners," "Rivals," and "Sworn Enemies," as well as the various "Symbiotic" and "Antagonistic" connections. As relationships with others deepen, Linked Forge can even occur during battles and missions. These special links allow for a better performance beyond individual capabilities in various situations.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 8 REMAKE - First Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RPhIhvsiIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, many in-game events, from major historical events to officer anecdotes, may now be initiated by officers through "Tales". This feature allows players to selectively participate in events of their choice. Some events even offer choices, and the player's choices will dynamically change the lives of the officers and the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 remake also introduces a new strategic element called "Traits." These are abilities possessed by certain officers with extraordinary achievements or memorable anecdotes in history. For example, Cao Cao can act twice in the Council, and Liu Bei is able to meet with officers without fail.</p>
<p>This will be the latest franchise installment following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-xiv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV</a>, launched in 2020 to fairly positive reviews.</p>

		<p>Koei Tecmo has announced that Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake will be released on October 24th, with the game coming to PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch. There is no planned Xbox One or Xbox Series XS release. To mark this announcement, a new trailer has been released for Romance of the Kingdoms 8 Remake, showing what to expect from the remake including new events.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 8 REMAKE - First Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RPhIhvsiIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake will have 55 different scenarios, and over 1000 officers. Players can create their own Officer as well, allowing for new stories to be weaved. In the game, players will do everything from helping out people living in town with their problems, to forging relationships with other officers. Some of these relationships are based in real history, but alternate history routes are open depending on the choices made during the story. Links are forged between characters, and the stronger this link is the more effective the partnership can be in diplomacy and in battle. The game has a renewed and Duel mode, and has the addition of a Debate mode where conflicts are sorted with words instead of swords.</p>
<p>It has been 17 years since Romance of The Three Kingdoms 8 last got any kind of release. The game first appeared for PC in Japan in 2001, before releasing in 2002 for the Japanese PS2 audience. It would then land on the shores of North America for PS2 in 2003, followed by Europe in 2004. A Japanese PSP exclusive release of Romance of the The Three Kingdoms 8 was then released in 2007.</p>

<p>Apex Legends is suffering at the moment. Following a miserable update, the game has been review bombed by disappointed fans worldwide, and even the game’s most prolific esports champions have spoken out about the state of the once-popular battle royale game. For a while, Apex Legends spearheaded the growth of the genre, but over the years, the charm has worn thin and players are starting to tire of Respawn’s competitive-first title.</p>



<p>In a recent statement, Phil ‘ImperialHal’ Dosen claimed that Apex is dying – a claim made despite him being one of the title’s most prominent and successful pro players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-way-back">No Way Back</h2>



<p>Apex Legends is sliding downhill at an alarming rate. The player count is experiencing an all-time low on some platforms, and initiatives dubbed ‘cash grabs’ by the community have left the ecosystem in a shambolic state, sneered at by players worldwide. </p>



<p>ImperialHal, one of the winningest Apex Legends pro players of all time, had a simple comment to make about the game that could have devastating implications:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apex is dying…… sucks to say</p>— Falcons ImperialHal (@ImperialHal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialHal/status/1811239465622344184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Last year, ImperialHal won the ALGS 2023 Championship just months after netting the top prize in the ALGS 2023 Split 1 Playoffs, netting a whopping amount of prize money in a relatively short period. In his time in the Apex Legends space, he has repped TSM’s banner in countless tournaments (before leaving the team in May this year), bringing home more prize money than any other Apex Legends pro player in history.</p>



<p>In a few weeks, Apex Legends is due to appear at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, but with the sentiment around the game sitting at an all-time low, there are concerns about how impactful the tournament will be. There’s plenty of money on the line, but the dwindling interest in the game is a constant threat.</p>

When a player is in a “Symbiotic” relationship with another officer, the officer will join and help the player in many situations, including domestics, councils, and battles. On the other hand, if the relationship is “Antagonistic,” the officer will not accept visits from the player and may even hunt them on the battlefield.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_898696"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Another unique strategy element to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</em> is the addition of the powerful and unique “Traits.” Helping officers stand out, “Traits” is an ability possessed by some officers with exceptional achievements or memorable anecdotes in history. For example, Cao Cao is able to act twice in council and Liu Bei is able to meet with officers without fail.</p><p>The variety of relationships built up throughout the experience are now dramatically displayed through a number of new elements. Players will be able to check on the constantly changing dynamics of each relationship through the “Relationship Chart.” The “Relationship Chart” not only shows relationships like “Sworn Siblings” and “Spouses” but also depicts special relationships such as “Destined Partners,” “Rivals,” and “Sworn Enemies,” as well as displaying the various “Symbiotic” and “Antagonistic” connections.  As relationships deepen with others, “Linked Forge” may even occur during battles and missions. These special links allow for a better performance beyond individual capabilities in various situations.</p><p>In addition, many events in the game, ranging from major historical incidents to anecdotes of officers can now be initiated by officers through “Tales.” This allows players to selectively participate in the events of their choosing. Additionally, some events offer choices and the player’s decisions will dynamically alter the lives of officers and the Three Kingdoms.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-favourite-indie-game-of-2023-is-now-on-game-pass.925509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/favourite-indie-game-2023-tchia/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Tchia was first released in March 2023 on PlayStation and PC before being ported to Nintendo Switch in June 2024. Now, it has been released on Xbox Series X|S, and to celebrate the arrival of the game, it has been added to the platform’s Game Pass service, which means that subscribers can get a copy of this stellar indie game for no extra charge.</p>



<p>Last year, our Mike Straw listed Tchia as his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/straw-2023-video-games-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number-one game of 2023</a>, and it’s easy to see why. This gorgeous and emotional open-world adventure title has some serious depth to it, and there are plenty of innovative elements under the hood to keep gamers engaged for hours on end, regardless of their interests or age group.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tchia-is-here">Tchia Is Here</h2>



<p>Tchia comes from Awaceb and is published by Kepler Interactive. It’s a magical, ethereal adventure set across a wide array of islands spread out in a stunning ocean environment based on New Caledonia. Players quickly come to learn that Tchia, a relatively unassuming but adventurous girl, has the power to ‘soul jump’, leaping between inanimate objects and a wide variety of animals at the press of a button.</p>



<p>We sat down last year with the game’s director, Phil Crifo, to learn more:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Indie Initiative Episode 3 - Tchia" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQFN1iKoFfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On the surface, Tchia smacks of titles like The Legend of Zelda, with players being able to explore a wide region by climbing, using a glider, or sailing on a raft. It also has neat mini-games such as rhythm challenges completed through the use of a dainty ukelele. With plenty of customisation options and stacks of side content to explore, Tchia really is well worth the investment – and with it now being on Game Pass, that investment is slim to nil.</p>



<p>Within six weeks of release, Tchia had secured one million sales, which is a testament to the entertainment value wrapped up in this neat little package.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anger Foot: Hilarious Indie Shooter Is Out Now on PC]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/anger-foot-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anger-foot-hilarious-indie-shooter-is-out-now-on-pc.925503/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/anger-foot-out-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Anger Foot is one of the most bizarre yet wholeheartedly satisfying first-person shooters you’ll ever play. It’s out now on PC and last year, I got the chance to play through a portion of the game at London’s WASD expo – and I loved every second of it. It’s a high-octane, punchy shooter with hilarious elements and some of the most eye-catching, explosive visuals I’ve ever seen.</p>



<hr>







<p>Anger Foot has been developed by Free Lives and published by Devolver. It’s arguably one of the zaniest FPS titles ever made – the game’s description on Steam will paint you a perfect picture of the nature of this game:</p>



<p>“<em>Anger Foot is a lightning fast hard bass blast of kicking doors and kicking ass. Crash through the caffeine-fuelled fever dream of Shit City, putting the boot to a menacing menagerie of merciless gangsters.</em></p>



<p><em>Unleash the world’s deadliest feet on a colourful cast of anthropomorphic enemies. Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smouldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks.</em>“</p>



<p>Here’s the launch trailer for the game, which is available now on PC:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Anger Foot Launch Trailer | Out Now on PC" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kJo0miz08g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s such an addictive game that you won’t want to put it down. It focuses on not making mistakes, which means that missing a single shot or kicking the wrong thing could reset your progress, forcing you to wrap the level back again and try something different. The story is brilliant – someone stole your sneakers and you’re willing to tear through a city-wide crime syndicate to get them back.</p>



<p>If that doesn’t sound like fun, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <div><p><em><a title="Platforms > GBA [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/gba">Game Boy Advance</a> – <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,639 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> Online</em> has added <em>Densetsu no Starfy</em>, <em>Densetsu no Starfy 2</em>, and <em>Densetsu no Starfy 3</em> on July 12, <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,452 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> announced. <span id="more-898641"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>Densetsu is the Japanese word for legend, and Starfy—Prince of Pufftop Kingdom, golden-hearted (and slightly clumsy) hero and frequent aquatic explorer—is ready to show you what makes him so legendary! Join Starfy, his sister Starly and his gruff best friend Moe for a swimmingly slapstick trilogy of games full of vibrant <a title="Genres > Action [2,001 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, all originally available on the Game Boy Advance system:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Densetsu no Starfy</em></strong> – No sleep ’til Pufftop! A sudden storm has caused Starfy, prince of the floating sky kingdom Pufftop, to plummet from his lofty home into the sea below. Luckily, he is rescued by an old lobster named Lobber who sets the adorable hero on a grand journey back to Pufftop. The way home is full of dangers, though, and Starfy will need to employ a variety of abilities— including Star Spin and Glide—and vehicles like the mighty Mole Tank, to overcome the challenges that await. The legend begins here!</li><li><strong><em>Densetsu no Starfy 2</em></strong> – Help Starfy save his mother and bring peace back to Pufftop Kingdom in this action-packed sequel! Ogura—the villain of the first game—is back to seek vengeance against Starfy, and this time he has Mama Star in his sights. The revenge-driven ruffian ransacks Pufftop and steals away Starfy’s mother in the ensuing kerfuffle, leaving Starfy no choice but to dive head-first into his next adventure. With his best friend Moe in tow and challenges aplenty to face, Starfy has his work cut out for him.</li><li><strong><em>Densetsu no Starfy 3</em></strong> – Starfy’s sister Starly joins him and Moe for their third adventure on Game Boy Advance! Discover the truth behind the mysterious villain that’s been pulling Ogura’s strings all this time and put a stop to their nefarious plans once and for all. Spin and float with the starry siblings and save the day across action-filled stages with the help of familiar friends, including… Wario?! You read that right: Wario crosses paths with Starfy and Starly to help them through the Undersea Ruins in Stage 8 (while hunting for treasure, of course), so be sure to check it out. Go, Starfy and Starly, go!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-is-up-for-preorder-at-best-buy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is the first time it's available here in the States</h2></div><div><section><p>Apparently it's not too late for Nintendo to be releasing new editions of their Switch Lite console. Right now Best Buy is offering preorders of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPbmb?object_uuid=3a83581a-b47a-47bc-a348-f3a3b529e93e&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition</a> handheld console for $209.99 with orders shipping out on September 26. That's $10 more than a stock Switch Lite, but that's more than justified by the fact that this edition includes a 12 month Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. The membership alone costs $49 and for most people, Switch Online is well worth the price of admission. Currently only Best Buy has it in stock, unless for whatever reason you prefer to purchase it from an overseas vendor. </p><h2>Preorder the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition Console</h2><div id="203239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Preorder the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition</h3></p><div><p>Includes 12-month Switch Online membership + Expansion Pass</p></div></div><p>The Switch Lite Hyrule Edition was announced during the June 18 Nintendo Direct alongside the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. We originally saw it available <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-where-to-preorder-uk">overseas in the UK</a>, but this is the first time we've seen a vendor here in the United States offer one up for preorder. This particular edition is adorned in a gold colorway very similar to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-limited-edition-oled-nintendo-switch">Switch OLED Hyrule Edition</a>. It is a gorgeous metallic finish that looks even better than in the photos. Aside from the tiny Triforce logo, the front of the case is free from any busy embellishments. The rear sports a single large embossed Hyrule Crest. It's all tastefully done and the best looking Switch Lite so far.</p><h3>Differences between the Switch Lite, Switch and Switch OLED</h3><p>The Switch Lite's major draw is that it's $100 less expensive than the Switch and $150 less than the Switch OLED. It's compatible with most Nintendo Switch games and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite is that (1) the controllers are not detachable, (2) the console can't be docked and played on a TV and (3) the display is smaller (5.5" vs 6.2" on Switch and 7" on Switch OLED). If you were intending to use the Switch solely as a handheld console, you might be better off just getting the Switch Lite. Even though the controls aren't detachable, the Switch Lite does support wireless Bluetooth, so you can always purchase another pair of Joy-Cons, a Switch Pro controller, or a compatible third party wireless Switch controller, and you can still play untethered.</p><h3>12 months of Switch Online membership Are Included</h3><p>The bundle includes a 12 month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Switch Online</a> membership. You will absolutely need this if you plan on accessing the online portions of your favorite games. That includes being able to play online against other opponents in Super Smash Bros Ultimate or Splatoon 3, downloading other people's creations in Minecraft or Mario Maker 2, or visiting someone else's island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p>Other perks include access to the NES, SNES and Game Boy emulator libraries, which include classic games like Super Mario Bros. 3, F-ZERO and Donkey Kong Country. You'll even be able to play these games offline for up to seven days after you last logged into your Nintendo Switch Online account. Members also get access to exclusive deals and offers at the eShop, cloud saving, and access to the NSO mobile app.</p><h3>You also get the Switch Online Expansion Pack</h3><p>Here's a rundown of what's included with the bonus expansion pack:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Classic Nintendo 64 games</li><li>Classic Game Boy Advance games</li><li>Classic SEGA Genesis games</li><li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course pass</li><li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise access</li><li>Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion access</li></ul><p><em>Looking for more Switch Lite deals? </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-of-2024-ends-before-prime-day"><em>This Switch Lite bundle</em></a><em> includes Animal Crossing: New Horizons for only $159. You better hurry, because it expires tonight.</em></p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 11, 2024 11:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div>
<div><p>Recently, Golden Lasso Games launched a Kickstarter campaign for their latest tabletop project. The project was <em>Starscape</em>, a sci-fi TTRPG heavily inspired by themes of found family. It was fully funded the same day it went live.</p>
<h2>The Starscape Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goldenlassogames/starscape"><em>Starscape</em></a> is a TTRPG that uses the Powered By The Apocalypse RPG system. The game is inspired by episodic sci-fi television shows, citing <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Firefly</em>, <em>Farscape</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, and <em>Babylon 5</em>.</p>

The players are crewmates on a starship, which they slowly make into their home as they travel the galaxy. Whether exploring planets, infiltrating space stations, or fighting with outlaws, their ship is their foundation and their shipmates are their second family.</p>
<p>The <em>Starscape</em> core rulebook contains over 200+ pages of original rules and playbooks. These include playbooks for different kinds of ships, ten different character archetype playbooks, a step-by-step Session Zero world creation process, and an economy where players trade, earn, and wager Trust.</p>
<p><em>Starscape</em> was a four-year-long passion project by writer and designer Kimi Hughes. She got the idea for the game during the COVID-19 lockdown after recently becoming a mother. Isolated from the rest of the world full of uncertainty and fear, she found hope through binge-watching <em>Star Trek</em>. This game is the result of that nostalgia trip.</p>

This includes character artist Carlos "Kaek" Eulefi (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/backroads-bringing-southern-gothic-horror-to-table" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Backroads</em></a>), cover artist&nbsp; Bryan Vectorartist, layout designer Bora Haxhirai (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everyday-heroes-rpg-book-rambo-total-recall" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Everyday Heroes</em></a>), and editor Jaye Elsinger (<em>Horror Beneath The Frost</em>).</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign's stretch goals are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Planet for $20:</strong> A PDF of the core rulebook</li>
<li><strong>Moon for $30:</strong> A PDF and physical softcover copy of the core rulebook</li>
<li><strong>Comet for $45:</strong> PDF, physical copy, and adventure supplement written by Kimi Hughes</li>
<li><strong>Star for $60:</strong> A hardcover deluxe edition of the core rulebook and PDF</li>
<li><strong>Supernova for $75:</strong> Hardcover deluxe edition, PDF, and adventure supplement</li>
<li><strong>Pulsar for $100</strong>: The deluxe hardcover core rulebook, PDF, adventure supplement, and a set of Starscape-themed dice</li>
<li><strong>Nebula for $250:</strong> Everything from the Pulsar tier, a Kickstarter-exclusive gilded hard cover copy of the core rulebook, and a seat at one-shot adventure</li>
<li><strong>Galaxy for $500:</strong> Everything from the Nebula tier, and having Kimi Hughes GM a one-shot of Starscape for your table</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Starscape</em> has raised&nbsp;$14,757, fulfilling its initial funding goal of $12,000. The campaign concludes August 8.</p>

The sequel, <a href="https://www.frontier.co.uk/news/press-releases/ride-wave-much-anticipated-planet-coaster-2">coming this fall</a>, will finally let you construct everything from wave pools and lazy rivers to custom-built waterslides.</p><p>You’ll also get to outfit your aquatic experience with changing rooms, sunbeds, lifeguards, and more. <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> builds upon its predecessor with the addition of new building and pathing tools, as well as an advanced event sequencer system that can give your guests new experiences.

            <p>
If you just can't get enough of those Epic Games Store freebies, here're some more for your list; Epic has revealed an upcoming twosome of arcade management action and Welsh folklore horror when its latest batch of free titles arrives next week. And, before that, grid-based, turn-based deckbuilder Floppy Knights is currently available to download and keep for zero pee.
</p>
<p>
Starting in the present, Rose City Games' <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/floppy-knights-6a735a">Floppy Knights</a> casts players as Phoebe, a brilliant young inventor with a robotic arm for a best friend, who's trying to save up enough money to leave home. To meet her goal, Phoebe must smash through armies of monsters using her titular tangible projections, all summoned from floppy disks. The result is a mix of tactical turn-based battling and deckbuilding that Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/floppy-knights-is-an-irresistible-mix-of-advance-wars-and-deckbuilding-1">said</a> "oozes fun, plain and simple",  back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Floppy Knights is free to download and keep on the Epic Games Store right now, and will remain so until next Thursday, 18th July. After that, two more freebies take its place:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise</li>
<li>The Maid of Sker</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nosebleed Interactive's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arcade-paradise">Arcade Paradise</a> is a sort of hands-on, first-person management game challenging players to turn their family's run-down laundrette into a thriving arcade. Your time is split between keeping the laundrette running - manually collecting trash, washing and folding clothes, unclogging the toilet, and so on - in order to scrape together the cash needed to buy new arcade cabinets and expand your empire. Which is where you'll spend the rest of your time: messing around with Arcade Paradise's 35 fully playable arcade games (with more available as DLC). Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcade-paradise-review-wash-clothes-and-play-games-in-this-feat-of-grime-caked-memory">liked Arcade Paradise a lot</a>!

<p>
As for <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/maid-of-sker-2ae24e">The Maid of Sker</a>, it's a Welsh-folklore-inspired slice of stealth horror that tells the supposedly true tale of Elizabeth Williams, who's said to have have died of a broken heart after being locked inside her home by her controlling father. The action picks up in 1898 when players must explore the shadowy halls of Sker Hotel, sneaking about the place to avoid a cult of enemies that react to sound. Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maid-of-sker-review-an-effective-if-unadventurous-slice-of-rural-horror">lukewarm on this</a> when it released in 2020, calling it an "effective if unadventurous slice of rural horror". So there you go.</p>
<p>
To recap, The Maid of Sker and Arcade Paradise are next week's freebies (yes, I totally got muddled up first time around), and Floppy Knights is free now - just remember to claim it before Thursday, 18th July, when it's all change.

                <p>Mining is an important part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, as it offers a great way to make a ton of money and is necessary for upgrading your tools and crafting important machines. Because mining is so important, it makes the decision between the two skill paths, Miner and Geologist, that much more difficult. Unlike the choice between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/should-you-choose-rancher-or-tiller-in-stardew-valley/1100-6524885/" data-ref-id="1100-6524885">Tiller and Rancher</a>, the answer is a little less obvious.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Miner or Geologist</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Miner path is better for making money, but the Geologist path can help you complete the Museum collection faster.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Miner increases the number of ore (copper, silver, gold, and iridium) by one piece per vein. This is a relatively substantial boost, since it's guaranteed to give the extra ore. This makes it easier to upgrade tools in the early game and lets you stockpile materials early on. The level 10 skill options are Blacksmith, which makes Metal Bars worth 50% more. That means Iridium bars sell for 1,500G and the late-game Radioactive Bars sell for 4,500G. The other skill is Prospector, which doubles the amount of Coal found. Obviously, the Blacksmith skill is significantly better than the Prospector skill.</p><p dir="ltr">Geologist adds a 50% chance for gems to spawn in pairs and it applies to Geodes found from breaking rocks. The level 10 skill Excavator doubles the chance to find Geodes, in addition to the chance for them to appear in pairs. With this skill you can easily get a triple digit amount of Omni Geodes from a single Skull Cavern run, which can be exchanged at the Desert Trade for Artifact Troves, which have a chance to contain some of the rarer Museum artifacts.</p><p>Ultimately, the <strong>Miner path is more profitable in the long run</strong>, but there are benefits to following the Geologist path. You can change skills at the <strong>Statue of Uncertainty</strong> in the Sewers for 10,000G per skill.</p>

                <p>At level 5 of each skill in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> you will be offered two skill options, specializing you in a certain aspect of that skill. One of the most important is the <strong>Rancher or Tiller</strong> choice at level 5 farming, since farming is such a large part of making money is Stardew Valley. One option focuses on animals, while the other focuses on crops. Here's what you should pick depending on how you play Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rancher or Tiller</h2><p><strong>In most cases Tiller will provide a larger boost to your profits and offers better level 10 skill options</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rancher provides a 20% boost to the sell price of animal products, both raw, like eggs and milk, and processed, like cheese and mayonnaise. Tiller increases the sell price of all crops by 10%, which only applies to crops and not foraged plants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331790" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331790"></a><figcaption>At level 5 you will have to choose a profession, but you can change it later for fee.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are two major reasons why Tiller ends up being better. First, most players won't have many animals, if any, by the time they reach level 5, assuming they are growing crops every season. While the 20% boost is larger, the amount of animal products you are selling is likely much lower than the amount of crops you are shipping every season. The second reason is that the level 10 skills are better for the Tiller than the Rancher.</p><p dir="ltr">The first Rancher level 10 option is <strong>Coopsmaster</strong>, which decreases egg incubation time, makes it easier to befriend coop animals, and increases the likelihood of the coop products being high quality. The second option is Shepard, which causes sheep to produce wool faster, makes befriending barn animals easier, and increases the likelihood of barn animal products being high quality. Both of these options reward you for focusing on either of the two animal types, but one of the level 10 Tiller options offers a much bigger boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The first option for Tiller level 10 is Agriculturalist, which increases the growth rate of all crops by 10%, which is the worse option of the two. The better option is Artisan, which increases the selling price of all artisan goods by 40% (except oil). This applies to not only pickled crops, but crops that have been turned into wine. But the <strong>biggest benefit here</strong> is that processed animal goods, like cheese, mayonnaise, and cloth, are all considered artisan goods and benefit from the 40% boost.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of the Artisan skill, Tiller is the superior choice. If you want to try the other option, the <strong>Statue of Uncertainty</strong> in the sewers allows you to change skills for 10,000G per skill change.</p>
