		<p>In a lot of ways, Project ARC feels like a throwback to the good old days of PS3 and Xbox 360 era gaming, where the fledgeling Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network stores and the boom in console multiplayer led to a lot of innovative riffs on familiar concepts. In this instance, Project ARC takes the tactical shooter that’s dominated by Counter Strike and Rainbow Six Siege, and pulls the camera out to give a top-down isometric view.</p>
<p>To be honest, if you’re a regular CS or R6 player, that’s pretty much all you need to know to pique your interest.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Gameplay Trailer | Project ARC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIeVl5-yEdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In our hands on with a mixture of devs and press, we played five matches split across the two game modes that the game will launch with. There’s the standard Team Deathmatch, which really feels like the lucid dream of an XBLA online twin-stick tactical shooter, and then there’s the mode that they’re calling Demolition, but is labelled as ‘Standard’ in-game. It has the, well, standard standard tactical shooter set up of one attacking team trying to reach one of two defended positions and place a timed bomb (sorry, the Decrypter), with all players having a single life per round. Oh, and there’s the ability for defenders to fortify, while attackers can break through destructible walls and windows.</p>


<p>Playing from a birds eye view, there’s an immediacy to how the game plays. You move with WASD, look with the mouse, and have to aim before you can fire –&nbsp;there’s no spray and pray here, which I very quickly discovered. The other thing I very quickly learnt is that crouching is a big deal. It lets you hide behind the waist-height cover, and anyone that’s stood up will shoot right over your head by default, giving you a split second advantage until they press the button to aim down at you, or shift to crouching themselves.</p>
<p>But crouching isn’t necessarily going to win you every fight, because battlefield awareness is everything, and you can’t see what’s going on if you’ve got your face buried in a hedge. Vision is actually a shared resource here. All players having a clearly defined cone of vision to their front, and a smaller radius of awareness around them, casting light and shadow through windows, doors and around obstacles, dynamically revealing and obscuring the enemy. You get to see everything that your teammates see, though, which instantly gives you a lot more understanding of what’s going on around the map –&nbsp;though this is handily assisted with a quick ping function as well.</p>

<p>As is pretty much inevitable for new online games, there’s a roster of stylised characters for you to choose from, each with a particular set of main and side weapon, a gadget ability, and then an item that you can select, depending on whether you’re attacking or defending. They’re not the most tactical looking bunch –&nbsp;there’s a Yakuza-looking guy, a shirtless chap with tattoos, a lady with a gold halter top and shiny puffer jacket, and a guy in a big cowboy hat –&nbsp;but they do have some good and distinctive styles of play and their roles and teamwork can really shine in Demolition.</p>
<p>You can pick any character whether you’re attacking or defending, and also double up on characters as well, but some are naturally intended for one side over the other – why bring the sledgehammer guy when you’re defending, and not the trip mine guy? You don’t need to smash through the boarded up walls when defending, but will rather want to use the ability to strengthen certain panels, and then place cover or barbed wire to slow the attackers.</p>
<p>Attackers can come from pretty much any direction, with multiple spawns to choose from, and I quickly felt the value of trying to coordinate efforts, whether splitting up to come from two sides or bull-rushing with the full team of five from one attack angle. You can obviously play for the elimination win, but playing the objective can also force the issue, whether that’s timing out the round as a defender or forcing them to counter-attack once you’ve placed the Decrypter.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more nuances here that we didn’t really delve into with just an hour’s playtime, and PUG Studios note that each firearm has its own sway and recoil characteristics, while aiming can be targeted at much more than just the high-low of standing and crouched –&nbsp;it does pay to mouse over an enemy to get the range right, I did feel –&nbsp;and obviously we only had the most basic of strategies start to emerge within Demolition.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I had a good time playing. There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.</p>
<p>Project Arc is currently only announced for PC and set for early access in 2025.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, BioWare <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/4453590197273100466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> patch after the game's launch on October 31. The patch, around 1GB in size, is largely focused on a variety of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where DLSS options could end up “grayed-out” on a 40-series Nvidia GPU.</li>

<li>Adjusted Companion Approval notifications so they remain on-screen longer as scenes end.</li>
<li>Harding now has arrows in her quiver and is ready for battle.</li>
<li>Global banter should no longer start too early.</li>

<li>Updated a number of assets to improve visual performance over long distances.</li>
<li>Fixed several distance “pop-ins” on level art assets.</li>
<li>Added collision to several assets that were missing it.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor texture issue with codex art.</li>
<li>Added haptics to a number of interactions and events.</li>
<li>Fixed lip sync in some ambient scenes.</li>
<li>Adjusted audio balance on several Dragon Age: The Veilguard assets.</li>
<li>Changing equipment no longer disables helmet voice processing.</li>
<li>Fixed several objective markers that were spawning improperly.</li>
<li>Cleaned up certain interactions between Skills that caused them to not behave as described.</li>
<li>Apparitions generated by Iron Veil will now attack</li>
<li>Entropic Spheres now behave properly on vertical surfaces.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Taunt would sometimes be cleared early, which caused enemies to ignore it.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where Rogues would not hold their bow while aiming down sights.</li>
<li>Made the detailed-stats screen more readable.</li>
<li>Balance changes made to certain fights to match design intent.</li>
<li>Balance adjustments made to several player skills.</li>
<li>Fixed leashing exploits on major encounters.</li>
<li>The Rage Demon’s Ring of Fire should now be appropriately dodgeable in all situations.</li>
<li>Slowed down the speedy raven in Hossberg.</li>
<li>Adjusted creepy corpse movement while they moved on/off-camera.</li>
<li>The Dalish elf in the Unwanted Guests quest is now an actual elf.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare blocking issue in the Sea of Blood quest.</li>

<li>Fixed a blocking issue in the Pinnacle of Its Kind quest.</li>
<li>Adjusted timing on epilogue text cards.</li>
<li>NPC necks no longer grow unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Corrected instances where Dragon Age: The Veilguard NPCs would not properly look at each other or at Rook.</li>
<li>Long hair should now properly mesh with certain armor.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with makeup in character creation.</li>
<li>Venatori crystal VFX should now disappear properly.</li>
<li>Added scroll wheel support to the sell screen.</li>
<li>Opening the journal while on the map no longer causes it to continue scrolling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, BioWare also added a Mass Effect themed cosmetic armor to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is entirely appropriate since the patch dropped on N7 Day. You'll find the armor in a new chest near the Caretaker's Workshop in the Lighthouse, on the condition that you have completed Harding's mission called The Singing Blade.&nbsp;That wasn't the only news Mass Effect fans got yesterday, by the way: there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series in development at Amazon Prime Video.</a></p>
<p>As for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the game peaked on Steam at 89.4K concurrent users last weekend. We'll see if it can top that this coming weekend.</p>

            <p>Could tower defence be the ultimate "it's Friday and I am here in body only" genre? I haven't really thought about it before, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rift-riff">Rift Riff</a>'s effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle <em>just</em> right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.</p>
<p>Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hidden-folks">Hidden Folks</a> designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cocoon">Cocoon</a>. There's a demo, if you fancy it.</p><!--more-->
<p>Rift Riff's singleplayer offerings are split between several dimensions. In each dimension, you build a home base and surround it with synergistic fortifications to stave off waves of marauding inkblot creatures, using their spilled "juice" to fund additional structures. It's an "open field" tower defender, with attackers emerging from portals around the map rather than following strict lanes (you're told how many are coming from each portal before rounds, but not what kind), and construction permitted only on certain sites.</p>
<p>In the demo, you get rapidfire turrets, tall sniper's eyries, AOE-lobbing cannons, and thumpers which slow attackers nearby. There are more towers and upgrades to unlock between dimensions, while roaming an Eschery hive of obsidian staircases.</p>
<p>The full game is out in 2025. If I had a request, it would be more playfulness with the fundamentals. Give us some of the old Hidden Folks whimsy - what John Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hidden-folks-review">called</a> "the feeling of a puzzle book that's magically come alive, a Where's Wally where you get to poke and prod the characters". Anyway, you can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800900/Rift_Riff/">Rift Riff</a> on Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed details of Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit which alleges that the game infringes on multiple patents. 
</p>
<p>
The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pokémon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">revealed</a> that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year - after Palworld's launch. 
</p>

<p>
The developer also stated that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are seeking "an injunction against Palworld", presumably to block its future sale within the Japanese jurisdiction of the patent lawsuit, as well as a fine of 10m yen (around £50k) split between the two firms, plus "late payment damages".
</p>
<p>
So, what are the patents Palworld is accused of infringing on?
</p>
<p>
As expected and sniffed out by fans and industry watchers previously, Nintendo's patents numbered 7545191, 7493117 and 7528390 lie at the heart of this legal action. These all cover gameplay mechanics such as the capture of digital creatures and the ability to ride on them. 
</p>
<p>
We previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">highlighted the first of these patents in particular as likely behind the Palworld lawsuit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The patent in question describes how a character catches a Pokémon by aiming and throwing a capture item, like a Pokéball, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes "owned by the player".
</p>
<p>
In Palworld, players catch Pals by aiming and throwing a capture item, named a Pal Sphere, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes owned by the player.
</p>
<p>
Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara previously dubbed the document a "killer patent" that would be "easy to infringe". 
</p>
<p>
Writing today, Palworld said once again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">it would continue to fight the case</a>. "We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings," it said.

<p>"On Borderlands, nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong: it sat on the shelf for too long during the pandemic, and reshoots and rising interest rates took it outside the safety zone of our usual strict financial models," the Lionsgate boss said during Thursday's earnings call.</p><p>"Coupled with softer-than-anticipated results for other releases in the quarter", Felthemier said there was "less margin for error than ever before", with "several of [its] other releases in the quarter, though cushioned by financial models that worked as intended, [also not] living up to either our standards or our projections".</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said in Take-Two's own earnings call earlier this week that though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"disappointing", the movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series</a>. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>This year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>.</p>
<p>The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

AMD didn’t introduce its Zen 4 X3D parts until five months after the Ryzen 9 7950X was first released in September 2022, with the 7800X3D arriving nearly seven months later.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As part of its Q2 FY 2025 financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20241108_q2_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>, SEGA has announced the sale of Amplitude Studios, the Paris-based studio known as the developer of Endless Space, Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/endless-space-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Endless Space 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/humankind-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humankind</a>, and more recently, Endless Dungeon. SEGA explained this concludes its wave of restructuring the European business, which previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included</a> the sale of Relic Entertainment and substantial layoffs.</p>
<p><em>The Group recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately ¥5.9 billion ($38.7 million) in the second quarter for the fiscal year due to the sale of overseas development studio Amplitude Studios SAS through a management buyout.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] The above-mentioned sale of Amplitude Studios SAS has been implemented as part of structural reforms in Europe that the Group has been working on since September 2023. The Group deems that this marks the completion of the series of structural reforms and will work toward realizing a business structure that further focuses on the strengths going forward, thereby tackling achieve regrowth in the European business.</em></p>
<p>SEGA has also discussed the 're-growth of the European business' for its two remaining studios, Sports Interactive and Creative Assembly. The former delayed Football Manager 2025 from November to March to ensure the game's quality. They changed the development engine to Unity, renewed the user interface, enhanced the graphics, and also integrated female football and acquired the full license for the Premier League. For its part, Creative Assembly registered increased sales for Total War: Warhammer III (mainly thanks to the Throne and Decay DLC) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total War: Pharaoh</a>.</p>
<p>As for Amplitude Studios, the good news is that it has returned in the hands of some of its former owners. While saying goodbye to SEGA, the studio also <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-space-2/blogs/953-returning-to-our-roots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a message with its fans:</p>
<p><em>Our studio is backed by strong and meaningful franchises and our team is committed to creating the best games possible. With our extensive experiences in strategy game development and two exciting titles currently in progress, we are confident in our ability to deliver outstanding experience to players. This decision allows us to be more agile in our approach while continuing to shape the vision that has been ours from the very beginning, empowering us to push boundaries and be closer as ever of our community.</em></p>
<p>More information about Amplitude's future will be revealed in January when the studio celebrates its anniversary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has reported its Q2 2024 financial results today, revealing that its PS5 console has now reached 65.5 million units sold. Hardware sales were slightly down year-over-year: whereas 3.8 million PlayStation 5 consoles were sold this past quarter, Q2 2023 saw 4.9 million PS5s sold.</p>
<p>However, this was more than offset by the increased sales elsewhere in the PlayStation department. For example, game software for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles reached 77.7 million units sold this quarter, a 14.94% increase compared to Q2 2023's 67.6 million units. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/sony-s-music-lineup-and-image-sensors-deliver-profit-beat?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, this was largely because of the outstanding success of Game Science's action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, which is said to have sold around 20 million units (though that includes the PC version). Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a> also performed rather well, selling 1.5 million units as of November 3, which is around two months after its launch.&nbsp;Even network services were more profitable for Sony. The PlayStation Plus subscriber base remained at 116 million monthly active users (MAUs), just like in Q1 2024; it was at 107 million units in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>The highly positive Q2 2024 led Sony to revise its gaming forecast upward for the full fiscal year results. Sales have been upped by 4% compared to August's estimate, mainly due to increased sales from third-party games, while PlayStation's operating income has been revised upward by 11%, also thanks to an improvement in hardware profitability.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Sony's fiscal year ends on March 31. As such, it will certainly benefit from big releases like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Monster Hunter Wilds, both slated for February 2025. But it's the next fiscal year that could be massive for PS5 game and hardware sales, with heavyweights like Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Mafia: The Old Country, Ghost of Yōtei, and of course, Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>The latter, in particular, could help the console catch up to its predecessor (it's currently trailing behind since the PS4 had sold 67.7 million units at the same point in its lifecycle). The impact of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released PS5 Pro console</a> also has yet to be seen, with Sony hoping it will account for around 20% of the sales from now on, just like the PS4 Pro.</p>

It launched to critical acclaim, with IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot review</a> returning a 9/10. We said: “A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Astro Bot’s sales aren’t up there with some of Sony’s big hitters (Helldivers 2 remains the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million sold in 12 weeks), it compares favorably to other recently released family friendly platforms. In Europe, launch sales of Astro Bot were 34% higher than those of 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and 52% bigger than those of 2020’s Crash Bandicoot 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Astro Bot’s sales success into more recent context, Sega’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-1-million-units-on-launch-day-sega-reveals">Sonic x Shadow Generations hit the one million sold mark on its launch day of October 25</a>, according to Sega. But that game launched across multiple platforms and generations, whereas Astro Bot is a PS5 exclusive. Astro Bot sales will surely continue to grow as we head into the crucial holiday shopping season and gamers look to buy a PS5 or the recently released PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All 173 PlayStation Characters in Astro Bot - Easter Eggs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Asobi has continued to support the game since launch with a number of updates that have added speedrun challenge levels and new cameos to rescue.

            <p>Following on from her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">role in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, Home Alone star Catherine O'Hara has joined the second season of… ok, no she hasn't just joined the second season <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>. But, the son she left at home has.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/">Deadline</a>'s sources, Macaulay Culkin has joined the cast for season two of Fallout, in a recurring role. Further details on his part remain slim for now, however Culkin is said to be playing "a crazy genius-type character" when the show's second season rolls around.</p>
<p>As Deadline notes, Culkin has already worked with Amazon before, cameoing in its adult animated series The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy, alongside his brothers.</p>

<p>Culkin will be joining cast members Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins - who play wide-eyed vault dweller Lucy, squire of the Brotherhood of Steel Maximus, disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean and the gunslinging Ghoul, respectively - when the Amazon's Fallout series makes its return.</p><p>As for when that will be? According to Leslie Uggams, who starred as Vault 33 Overseer Betty Pearson in the first season of Fallout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">filming for season two will begin this month</a>. Meanwhile, in June, Fallout's showrunners said they wanted to get the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">second season of Amazon's adaptation out as soon as it is possible</a>.</p>

<p>Following the immense success of the live-action Fallout television series, thanks to Amazon Prime, it was only a matter of time before the series’ second season started attracting more high-profile names. Of course, season one ended on a cliffhanger, so we’re all beyond excited to dive in for more, and now we have a tidbit of information to run with. According to a recent report, Macaulay Culkin joins the cast of Fallout season two, apparently playing a ‘crazy genius-type’ character. I’m a little curious about the role, and something in me thinks his part involves the Enclave.</p>



<p>In the original report published by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Macaulay Culkin’s role in the television series based on the long-popular role-playing game franchise remains relatively new. The only information we have about his performance is that he’s a crazy genius of some sort.</p>



<p>That said, Culkin joins a large and growing roster of exceptional stars, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ella Purnell</li>



<li>Walton Goggins</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-plays-knight-titus-in-the-fallout-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Moten</a></li>



<li>Kyle MacLachlan</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-xelia-mendes-jones-in-fallout-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xelia Mendes-Jones</a></li>
</ul>







<p>Following the overwhelming reception to the first season, which debuted as one of Prime Video’s Top 3 most-watched series and received 16 Emmy nominations, a second season was almost immediately greenlit for production. While it’s still a ways off, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallouts-second-season-starts-filming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filming begins shortly</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review.1030488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is not the anthill to die on.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be nice to look at, but Empire of the Ants’s single-player campaign is outright terrible and dull. It’s around 12 hours worth of missions that pivot between being pointlessly easy – due to a passive enemy AI that doesn’t even know how to use powers to buff its troops, which is crucial to success – to obnoxiously difficult on a dime, and it doesn’t let you save mid-mission. Most infuriatingly, there’s one where nine waves of enemies spawn and attack from all directions, and you instantly fail if you lose control of a single one of the seven nests you have to defend – so many that it’s impossible to upgrade them all with effective defenses. That last wave is a doozy, too, which meant I had to replay it from the start multiple times just to overcome the final challenging moments where they come in large enough numbers to be a threat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mixed in with those combat missions are absurdly tedious ones where you only control your single ant as you hunt for tiny bugs – which are usually very effectively camouflaged thanks to the realistic art style – spread across a big map. You’re guided only by a non-directional proximity sensor, so you have to run in circles to triangulate each bug. There are also “stealth” missions that don’t actually care if you’re detected as you scan enemy legions (dying has basically no consequences either), and these similarly amount to running around a map looking for things. Sometimes you’re told to catch butterflies or fireflies that fly away when you get close – the only way I found to do it was to wait for them to repeat their scripted movement pattern and land right in front of me, and that is exactly as much fun as it sounds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering you can climb any object and walk on the ceiling, it’s surprising that only a couple of the missions make any use of this ability at all, and those that do are mostly the boring, non-combat variety. (There was only one mission where my units fought upside-down, which was very funny because the corpses of dead ants rained down.) Similarly, the only thing Empire of the Ants does with its impressive sense of scale is give you a few objects – like a glass bottle or a toy giraffe – to run around, picking up little glowy things as you explore them. I’ll grant you that this does remind me of how I’ve seen real ants figure out if an object is something they want to eat, but I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You aren’t forced to do all of these missions to complete the campaign – you select missions by speaking to quest-giving ants in a sequence of hub areas that serve as a sort of menu – but I don’t recommend any of them, or the campaign in general. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it’s not all that buggy (other than… you know).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing you do in these hubs is talk to ants. I haven’t read the books Empire of the Ants is based on, but if the Wikipedia synopsis is anything to go by this game’s story isn’t even close to following them because there are no human characters or secret ant weapons to make it remotely interesting. I’m going to assume that its numerous conversations about how your nest is threatened by termites and other visually identical ant species or floods don’t do the novels justice. Even the ant civil war that breaks out is over almost as abruptly as it begins, ensuring there’s no substance there either.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">While Empire of the Ants’s nearly photo-realistic world looks incredible at first glance, its boring and annoying real-time strategy campaign is the ant-ithesis of that. Combat missions are mostly trivially easy because the AI doesn’t seem to understand crucial mechanics, and those that aren’t are obnoxious because you can’t save mid-mission to replay the tough parts without trudging through the easy setup; Meanwhile, all of the non-combat missions are tedious searches for needles in haystacks and the story fails to make ant politics intriguing. It’s easily the worst single-player campaign I’ve played in years.</p></div></div><div><div data-cy="review-content"><p>awful</p><p>Pretty to look at but painfully dull and frustrating to play, Empire of the Ants's single-player campaign has none of the depth of the multiplayer and packages bad AI with boring missions and a meandering story.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Nvidia, only 6% of its subscribers go over 100-hours. Subscribers will also have the option to carry over 15 hours unused streaming time every month. But if players exceed 100-hours in any given month, they will have the option of buying 15-hour blocks of playtime.</p><p>Nvidia explained that the new 100-hour cap was put in place in order to avoid increasing the membership prices for "the foreseeable future." The company is also offering a temporary 25% discount on Ultimate and Performance day passes through November 22. Those day passes can be upgraded to monthly or six-month recurring memberships that can also lock in a year without the 100-hour restriction.</p>

            <p>
Nvidia has announced its GeForce Now cloud gaming service will soon introduce a playtime cap of 100 hours a month for paying Performance (previously Priority) and Ultimate subscribers, although additional hours can be purchased for a fee.
</p>
<p>
Nividia shared the news <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">on Reddit</a>, saying the limit would help it "continue providing exceptional quality and speed - as well as shorter queue times". It also insisted the switch from an unlimited allowance would "comfortably accommodate 94 percent of members".
</p>
<p>
Paying subscribers wanting to use GeForce Now for more than the allotted 100 hours per month - equating to approximately three hours per day - will now need to pay extra, with 15 additional hours costing $2.99 USD for Performance members and $5.99 for anyone subscribed to its Ultimate tier. Up to 15 unused hours will automatically roll over into the next month.

<p>
Nvidia's new restrictions come into affect at the start of 2025, but all existing subscribers - as well as anyone signing up before 31st December this year - will continue to get unlimited playtime until January 2026. The company also notes anyone currently subscribed to GeForce Now's Founders tier will retain their unlimited playtime hours for life, provided there's no lapse in their membership. Changing to an Ultimate subscription, however, will immediately apply the new terms, imposing the 100-hour monthly play limit from January 2026.
</p><p>
In addition to its playtime limitations, Nvidia has announced a number of new GeForce Now benefits. Subscribers to the newly renamed Performance tier will soon be able to stream in 1440p instead of the previous 1080p, and ultrawide resolutions will also be supported. Furthermore, all Performance and Ultimate subscribers will be able to save their in-game graphics settings across streaming sessions.

          <p>Confirming previous <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/amazon-is-nearing-a-deal-to-make-a-mass-effect-tv-series/">rumors</a>, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/">Variety</a> reports that Amazon will be moving ahead with producing a TV series based on the popular Mass Effect video game franchise. The writing and production staff involved might not inspire confidence from fans, though.</p>
<p>The series' writer and executive producer is slated to be Daniel Casey, who until now was best known as the primary screenwriter on <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em>, one of the late sequels in the Fast and the Furious franchise. He was also part of a team of writers behind the relatively little-known 2018 science fiction film <em>Kin</em>.</p>
<p>Karim Zreik will also produce, and his background is a little more encouraging; his main claim to fame is in the short-lived Marvel Television unit, which produced relatively well-received series like <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Jessica Jones</em> for Netflix before Disney+ launched with its Marvel Cinematic Universe shows.</p>
<p>Another listed producer is Ari Arad, who has some background in video game adaptations, including the <em>Borderlands</em> and <em>Uncharted</em> movies, as well as the much-maligned live-action adaptation of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's a bit of a mixed bag here. No plot details have been released, but it seems likely that the show will tell a new story rather than focus on the saga of Commander Shepherd from the games, since the games were all about the player inhabiting that character with their own choices. That's only a guess, though.</p>
<p>Amazon is currently riding high after the smash success of another video game TV series, <em>Fallout</em>, which impressed both longtime and new fans when it debuted to critical acclaim and record viewing numbers earlier this year.</p>

            <p>
InZoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton, is absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> - to the point a lot of life sim fans are very excited indeed. So the good news is it now has a release date; the bad news is it's been delayed into next year to give it a "stronger foundation".
</p>
<p>
InZoi, which promises a "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will", was initially announced last year, when it was expected to launch for PC sometime in "Q4" this year. Now, however, Krafton has revised that release, confirming Inzoi will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">launching into Steam early access</a> on 28th March next year.
</p>
<p>
In a message announcing the news, InZoi director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim explained the decision to delay the game had been made after reviewing feedback and "analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests". He added the revised release will give the studio time to "improve areas that need attention" and "create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation".

"It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," Kim continued. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZoi — a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZoi a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible."
</p><p>
Players did, of course, get a bit of a look at InZoi back in August, when Krafton briefly released its impressively flexible character creator on Steam. During its five days of availability, the demo saw a peak of over 18K players, one of them being Eurogamer's own Jessica Orr, who shared a little of her character creating adventures right here.
</p>
<p>
"Visually, [the demo is] stunning," she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-old-brands-revitalised-ageing-classics-and-cursed-character-creators">wrote</a>. "It's a little unbelievable how good it looks, actually, even on lower graphical settings. The customisation goes deep too. It's got all the usual bells and whistles, and even a few chimes to boot, as we're treated to entire categories for things like fake nails... Personality customisation doesn't go as deep, from what I can tell in the demo, but it's nice to see inclusive gender and sexuality options there already."
</p>
<p>
InZoi is just one of several Sims-like that have surfaced in recent years. Paradox Interactive's Life by You has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">now been cancelled</a>, but that still leaves the highly anticipated Paralives, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">scheduled to launch into early access sometime next year</a>, and if you fancy something a little more lo-fi, you can also play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/">adorably retro - but still surprisingly robust - Tiny Life</a> on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/weve-unboxed-a-ps5-pro-and-theres-also-a-cat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> is here, aiming to usher in a new era of higher resolutions, higher frame rates, and more ray-tracing… but we’ve only taken delivery of our review unit today, so the first step is obviously to do an unboxing.</p>
<p>Also, my cat decided he wanted to be involved for a moment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Our PS5 Pro has been de-boxed" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4ns9g2d9jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First impressions are naturally quite important, and the PS5 Pro is a solid iteration of the PS5’s design. It keeps the same inverted ice cream sandwich look, and which was iterated upon for the PS5 Slim by splitting the cover panels in half. The PS5 Pro now segments those panels even further with some gills, hiding some more air vents for the fan to suck in air from the surroundings.</p>
<p>What’s most impressive, though, is that the PS5 Pro promises a big jump up in graphical performance, but does so while actually being significantly smaller than the original PS5. It’s roughly the same height, but the core of the machine is skinnier (accepting that there’s no disc drive attached by default), and it’s not as deep, either. The original PS5 now feels implausibly big once you pull it out of your gaming set up.</p>

<p>One bizarre design choice is that the PS5 Pro&nbsp;<em>still wobbles!&nbsp;</em>Included in the box are two attachable feet to slot into the gilled section, providing two contact points to anything you set the console on, but there’s only one other contact point on the case. It’s certainly far better than the original PS5’s strange mounting disc, which made moving it for any reason a perilous chore (and also let the console wobble very easily), but you still have a tripod and pushing on a corner will wobble it. I believe this should be improved with the disc drive adding a flattened bulge to the bottom, but it’s no less barmy.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I’ve quickly run through the console’s set up process – using a network data transfer to copy users across, and with plans to swap an NVMe across to shift the bulk of my game data (which was unavailable within the data transfer utility).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a smorgasbord of comparisons over the coming days, as I plan to look at and compare the various game performance modes across the variety of PlayStation Studios and third party games. We won’t be able to hit all of the 55 launch games, but you can expect several round ups of different categories as I work toward a console review.</p>
<p>I’ll also try and gauge what my cat thinks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-overwatch-2-ranks-how-to-hit-top-500/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Like all other competitive games, Overwatch 2 has a popular ranked mode that gamers can play and climb up the skill ladder. With multiple different ranks to hit, getting to the top is no easy feat. Here is a list of all the Overwatch 2 ranks and how you can hit them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-2-ranks">All Overwatch 2 Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Overwatch 2:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze </strong>(V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Master</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Champion</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Top 500</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game follows a pretty standard ranking system, featuring five levels in almost all of them, with five being where you start and one being the final level before ranking up. The game uses Matchmaking Rating (MMR), which many other games use too to calculate ranks. </p>



<p>However, the final rank, Top 500, is quite impressive to hit. Not many games have a final rank that specifies what number you are in the world in the game. This gives players a global leaderboard to strive to get their name on, making the game just that much more competitive.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-overwatch-2-guide-to-top-500">How to Rank Up in Overwatch 2 | Guide to Top 500</h2>



<p>To rank up in Overwatch 2 you simply must play ranked matches. As you progress through the game’s ranked system, you will find games tend to get much more difficult, as ranked uses skill-based matchmaking when putting you in matches.</p>



<p>Getting your name on the Top 500 list is not something that can just be done overnight. Many competitive Overwatch players spend countless hours grinding ranked and never even hit the Top 500.</p>



<p>Still, by winning matches, players can move up in the ranks. </p>



<p>When you first start playing ranked mode in Overwatch 2, the game will have you unranked for a series of games before calculating what badge you should receive. </p>



<p>While your first rank will not be Grandmaster or Champion, some players may start at as high as Gold.</p>

<p>Excited for Black Friday this year? Every year, loads of deals are released for both Pokémon cards and Pokémon games. So, what deals do Pokémon fans have to look forward to this year?</p>



<p>Here are the best 2024 Black Friday deals for Pokémon fans.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-pokemon-game-black-friday-deals">Best Pokémon Game Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>As of now, there have been no revealed Black Friday deals for Pokémon video games. However, games such as Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, Arceus and others could easily be getting a deal this year.</p>



<h4 id="h-where-to-find-pokemon-game-black-friday-deals"><strong>Where to Find Pokémon Game Black Friday Deals:</strong></h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Walmart</strong></li>



<li><strong>Target</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best Buy</strong></li>



<li><strong>Amazon</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nintendo eShop</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>We will keep you updated as more information is released over the next few weeks.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-pokemon-card-black-friday-deals">Best Pokémon Card Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Not worried about the games, but instead want to grab some Pokémon cards on Black Friday? Luckily, we already know of a few special deals for this year’s popular shopping holiday, many of which are available now.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-pokemon-card-black-friday-deals">All Pokémon Card Black Friday Deals:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stellar Crown Booster Box</strong> ($104.95 at Walmart)</li>



<li><strong>Trick or Trade BOOster Bundle</strong> ($12.97 at Walmart)</li>



<li><strong>Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</strong> ($33.75 at Walmart)</li>



<li><strong>Battle Academy&nbsp;</strong>($10.99 at Miniature Market)</li>
</ul>



<p>While the deals listed above are the only current deals ahead of Black Friday, Pokémon fans should expect more to be announced just ahead of the day. In fact, we will probably see a few deals drop on Black Friday and Black Friday only.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-to-shop-for-pokemon-cards-black-friday">Where to Shop for Pokémon Cards Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Like the Pokémon games, the cards also have a set of stores that players should head to if they want Black Friday deals. Pokémon cards are a hot commodity, though, so expect any deals to go extremely fast.</p>



<h4 id="h-stores-with-black-friday-deals-on-pokemon-cards">Stores with Black Friday Deals on Pokémon Cards:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Target</strong></li>



<li><strong>Walmart</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best Buy</strong></li>



<li><strong>Miniature Market</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While the stores listed above are massive chains, you might have a local card shop in your area doing deals on Pokémon cards. It is always best to check those out and support local businesses.</p>



<p>Will you be buying anything Pokémon-related this Black Friday?</p>
