			<p>In just five days, KOEI TECMO will publish Rise of the Ronin on PC. The action roleplaying game was originally launched nearly a year ago as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, published by Sony itself on the console. That's nearly the same amount of time that passed between the PlayStation and PC launches of Nioh, which evidently featured a similar timed exclusivity deal.</p>
<p>Rise of the Ronin clearly has a lot in common with Nioh, although it goes for a different type of experience, more akin to something like Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed. For a full review of the game, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kai's original article</a>. Here, I'll focus on the technical aspects of the upcoming PC version.</p>
<p>Developer Team Ninja once again used KOEI TECMO's proprietary Katana Engine, a technology already seen in previous games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dynasty-warriors-9-east-west-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Hearts</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>. All these games had something in common: huge technical issues. Unfortunately, Rise of the Ronin is no exception. Even on a top-of-the-line PC configuration, the game struggles to provide smooth frame rates, to say nothing of the mediocre visual quality.</p>
<p>On the surface, the developer does offer support for modern features like support for the DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers, High Dynamic Range mode for HDR displays, NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Resolution (DLSS) or Deep Learning Anti Aliasing (DLAA), AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 3, Intel XeSS, NVIDIA and AMD Frame Generation, and even ray tracing, though only for the reflections. There are also several graphics settings that can be used to customize the experience, including the ability to turn off annoying filters like vignette and chromatic aberration, which is appreciated. The frame rate can only go up to 120 frames per second (60 in the cutscenes), which is a shame, although Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is guilty of the same - and modders will likely remove this limit shortly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Custom Benchmark While Roaming in Yokohama</figcaption></figure>
<p>What's really disappointing is the performance. On a rig equipped with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, a game like Rise of the Ronin should run fast and smooth, but that's not the case at all. Simply roaming around the city of Yokohama averages just 64 frames per second at 4K resolution with every setting maxed out and NVIDIA's DLAA plus Frame Generation enabled. Worse, it feels quite stuttery, too. According to FLAT (Frame Latency Analytics Tool), over 14% of the frame time during the benchmark was spent under stuttering conditions.</p>
<p>This is easily the worst performance I've seen since I set up this PC, and it's not like it comes with some sort of visual spectacle, either. Sure, Rise of the Ronin looks better than KOEI TECMO's previous titles and also has a larger explorable world, but that's not saying much. Even with DLAA turned on, shimmering and aliasing are still noticeable, an issue that I spotted in Nioh and Wo Long, too. Moreover, several assets are evidently in very low resolution despite the game taking up 151.6 GB of your drive's space after the installation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin PC 4K Maxed (DLAA/RT) Gameplay on RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pc8m6wVFr9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I wouldn't at all be surprised to see the game launch to very mixed user reviews on Steam, with technical complaints sure to be cited in the comments. It's a shame because the game itself is interesting enough, but from a technical standpoint, Assassin's Creed Shadows looks set to slaughter it. Usually, I would tell you to wait for the developer to improve the game's performance through patches, but KOEI TECMO doesn't exactly have a great track record of doing that. Of course, I'd be happy to see that trend change. On GeForce RTX 50 GPUs, it would definitely help if NVIDIA whitelisted the game to take advantage of the NVIDIA Override capability to use the latest DLSS transformer model and possibly Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>However, that would just brute force through the game's worst issues. Judging from the repeated technical disappointments offered by the studio's latest games, I would recommend they switch to Unreal Engine as they did for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster. Granted, Epic's game-making technology is not without its problems, but it's certainly far more advanced than what they have.</p>

<p>Set to release on March 25th across all platforms, Nightmares and Visions' first big addition to&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>is the Mortis Trials activity, which is essentially a wave-based Horde-style mode in which you'll be able to build "new and exciting playstyles" each time you enter a trial.</p>

<p>Beating these trials will reward you with "secret information on some characters present on the Mourningstar", so it sounds rather like&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update" rel="nofollow">following in the footsteps of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update" rel="nofollow">Space Marine 2</a>&nbsp;</em>by introducing extra lore as a reward for slaughtering the Imperium's enemies.</p>

Fatshark says it'll reveal more about the changes to Havoc soon.</p>

<p>If you're an Ogryn player, you'll also be pleased to know that the Ogryn talent tree is being reworked to give you "more build opportunities", and a few Ogryn weapons will also be tweaked to make the big guy feel a little better to play.</p>

<p>All in all, Fatshark says it has "37 pages of notes" relating to Nightmares and Visions. It's not clear whether the developer is referring to the patch notes with that number, but the update is set to be a big one, at any rate.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide</em>, it's effectively Fatshark's grimdark&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>answer to its horde-based FPS&nbsp;<em>Vermintide</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which sees you battling the minions of the Chaos God Nurgle as an Operative in the Hive City of Tertium, has been out for a couple of years now on PC and Xbox, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-ps5-release-december" rel="nofollow">secured itself a PS5 release</a> late last year as well.</p>

<p>2K’s annual tradition of unveiling a ton of post-launch superstars continues. WWE 2K25’s sizable roster will grow thanks to the confirmed release dates for many DLC characters, and you can start your training right now.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25 offers a roster</a> so big it would tower over Andre The Giant, Big Show, Omos, and The Great Khali combined. There’s a ton of hype for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, so much so that players are already grabbing their tickets through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-wwe-2k25-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>.</p>



<p>Getting your ticket to the dance is one thing, but what about the afterparty? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-season-pass-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K25 Season Pass</a> is the perfect remedy for those who want a rollicking Royal Rumble of talent to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>The WWE 2K25 Season Pass includes Five full Character Packs introducing new wrestlers and the Supercharger Pack to inject more content into WWE 2K25 after launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re wondering why many of your favorite in-ring stalwarts are missing, there’s a good chance they’re being saved for the upcoming <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 DLC</a>. If you purchase the Season Pass, you are guaranteed all Character Packs and the Supercharger Pack.</p>

<p><strong>A new piece of DLC is arriving pretty much every month between now and the end of November 2025. The Supercharger Pack is available from launch, meaning you can jump into its contents straightaway.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll have a brief gap in August of this year. Other than that, a new Character Pack is inbound in most months. It’s likely 2K will completely shift focus and turn its attention to WWE 2K26 after this.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-showcases-a-deep-dive-into-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows%E2%80%99-hideout-feature.1126863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new Assassin’s Creed Shadows blog post, Ubisoft has released new information on the Hideout feature coming to the game.</p>



<p>As briefly explained in the introduction, the Hideout will be the players base of operations and a fully customizable sandbox allowing you to build your perfect home.</p>



<p>The Hideout will be located in the Izumi Settsu province and is surrounded by hills on all sides for protection. Its said that the Hideout will be a acre of fully customizable land, which players are able to place buildings, pavilions, pathways, bushes, trees, ponds, mossy rocks, local flora &amp; fauna, and countless other Japanese cosmetic elements found or acquired throughout their journey.</p>



<p>“We really want players to make the Hideout their own” says Dany. “Throughout your adventure, most of the content for customization keeps unlocking as you progress, so your customization options will truly reflect your journey.” The building tools are simple enough for everyone to draw up a quick and easy layout, but there’s enough depth to sink hours into crafting your vision.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the Hideout, players will be able to create six main rooms, which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-main-rooms">Main Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tomiko’s Hiroma</strong><br>Tomiko’s main house and gathering hall is already built when players first get their hands on the Hideout. This building is the cornerstone of the Hideout, granting quick access to most of the important functions of the Hideout. It can be changed cosmetically, but the Hiroma cannot be moved or removed.</p>



<p><strong>Stables</strong><br>An important pillar of your Hideout, the stables unlock the ability to use your scouts for smuggling stockpiles in enemy camps or castles; doing this will allow you to receive extra resources at the end of a season.</p>



<p><strong>Forge</strong><br>The Forge unlocks the ability to upgrade your weapons and gear to higher tiers, which is crucial for staying strong as you level up. It also allows you to dismantle unwanted armor and weapons into raw materials, engrave new perks on existing gear, and unlock the transmog feature for customizing your look and weapons, accessible in the inventory menu.</p>



<p><strong>Kakurega</strong><br>This unlocks the ability to purchase and claim safehouses around Japan. These safehouses extend the Hideout’s functions to distant areas, as well as unlock safe fast travel points well outside enemy territory. Some features, like the regional contract boards, can be accessed from here as well. As mentioned in our exploration article, kakurega are also great to refill your tools, replenish your scouts, or manage the allies you want to bring on your next missions.</p>



<p><strong>Study</strong><br>The Study increases the maximum number of scouts and refines the search zone when scouts locate an objective on the World Map, optimizing objective investigations.</p>



<p><strong>Dojo</strong><br>The Dojo unlocks the ability to train Naoe and Yasuke’s allies that can be recruited and called in combat, elevating their ranks and increasing the power of each of their unique skills.</p>



<p>In addition, players can also create seven themed rooms which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-themed-rooms">Themed Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tera</strong><br>Adding a Tera (altar) in the Hideout boosts the amount of XP players can gain while venturing out in the world, effectively acting as a 10% XP booster.</p>



<p><strong>Jinja</strong><br>Shinto shrines around the world allow players to pray and earn a small stat boost – called a boon – for a few minutes. The Jinja’s presence in the Hideout magnifies the effects of any shrine’s boon encountered in Japan.</p>



<p><strong>Nando</strong><br>The Nando – a kind of barracks for sleeping and storing personal items – makes recalling scouts that have been used less costly – a function that extends to all Kakurega safehouses.</p>



<p><strong>Zashiki</strong><br>Apart from the cool factor of owning your very own&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;room, the Zashiki&nbsp;increases ration efficiency (health restoration) for both Naoe and Yasuke.</p>

<p>“Once recruited, allies will spend a significant amount of their time in the Hideout, working, resting, training, and otherwise occupying themselves during their down time. Building new rooms will diversify the actions that they can perform there – allies with an inclination for martial training might spend more time in the Dojo, while others with a taste for&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;might enjoy spending time in the Zashiki,” the blog reads.</p>

            <p>Nexon is ending support for its third-person looter shooter The First Descendant on PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The free-to-play sci-fi-flavoured release came out last year across Xbox, PlayStation and PC. It got off to a decent enough start, and in the first week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-free-to-play-sci-fi-shooter-the-first-descendant-clocks-up-10m-players-in-just-one-week">welcomed 10 million players into the fray</a>. Things have petered off since then, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/">SteamDB</a> data showing an average of 8,227 concurrent players on Valve's platform in February. Its peak concurrent player average was 123,352 in July last year, but this dropped to an average of 54,662 concurrents by August.</p>

<p>Nexon is going to keep supporting The First Descendant, however it has now announced it will be ending support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players from 19th June, which is just shy of its first anniversary. The game will also be delisted from the platforms (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>According to Nexon, it has decided to stop supporting the last generation of consoles in a bid to keep "increasing player satisfaction". The developer said it had "increased the scale" of The First Descendant, and this meant the team was facing difficulties "maintaining the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One builds".</p>
<p>Those who are playing The First Descendant on either a PS4 or Xbox One will still be able to transfer their progress to other platforms via The First Descendant's cross-save functionality.</p>

</span></p><p>On its release last year, Nexon found itself having to respond to claims the iconography of The First Descendant was strikingly similar to icons found in another sci-fi release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sci-fi-shooter-the-final-descendants-icons-are-strikingly-similar-to-those-used-in-destiny-2">players identified a surprising number of similarities</a> between the icons and weapons used in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">designs in questions were subsequently removed from the game</a> "with deep affection and respect" for other "looter shooters".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds is now available to play via the GeForce NOW cloud. CAPCOM's new game recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> sales records (over eight million units in just three days), and now it'll open up to a new audience, allowing even those without a powerful PC or console to join the hunt via the GeForce NOW app on any PC, Shield TV devices, Mac, and compatible TVs and smartphones.</p>
<p>It's a big week overall for GeForce NOW users, who also get support for the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game FragPunk and Hazelight's latest title, Split Fiction. The latter game earned an 8 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Birch's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, NVIDIA's cloud platform also supports the newly launched action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished. The game developed by Eko Software is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863430/Dragonkin_The_Banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out now in early access</a> and you can read Francesco De Meo's thoughts <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</em></p>
<p>The weekly GeForce NOW roundup also includes the following previously released games which, however, are now supported on other stores:</p>
<p>● Ghostrunner 2 (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Prey (Epic Games Store, Steam, and Xbox available on PC Game Pass)</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed.1126836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake developer Ballistic Moon has reportedly been "effectively closed", with only a handful of employees remaining at the studio.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, which cites "multiple sources with knowledge of the situation", the remaining staff at Ballistic Moon were let go in December. Those layoffs followed staff reductions back in September, just before the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date" rel="nofollow">October release</a>.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming's sources say that around 40 staff were let go in September, and that about 20 more lost their jobs in December, with only the studio's founders and "possibly" a few more employees remaining at Ballistic Moon. No developers, marketing execs, or PR folks are still there, apparently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=mrDN0JH6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=XG57tRiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake Ballistic Moon has apparently effectively ceased to exist.</figcaption></figure><p>Ballistic Moon's gutting effectively means that the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake has nobody working on patches or updates; a source told Insider Gaming that people were "sharing bugs" to make Ballistic Moon aware of them, but that "there is no one working on patch support".</p>

<p>Apparently, Ballistic Moon's owners attempted to keep the ball rolling with regards to further support for&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, but Sony wasn't interested. Sources also told Insider Gaming that Ballistic Moon's owners were looking for new publishers for other projects, but they weren't successful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it probably isn't a surprise that Ballistic Moon is in its current position. Reportedly,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord" rel="nofollow">debuted to a lower PS5 player count</a> than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">doomed shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>, and its Steam player count peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2172010/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">just over 2,600 players</a> isn't particularly noteworthy either.</p>

<p>Given that Sony currently seems to be in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">middle</a> of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">rethink</a> when it comes to its gaming operations, studios like Ballistic Moon are unfortunately likely to be the first in the gaming giant's firing line.</p>




<p>Of course, with respect to Ballistic Moon, I'd question the necessity of remaking&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>in the first place. The original's not particularly old, and it seems to me that a remaster along the lines of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>'s</a> would have worked just as well.</p>

<p>In any case, if you do want to see the fruits of Ballistic Moon's labor, the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/until-dawn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and you can read our Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

In fact, you might have to go back to 2002’s <em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind </em>to find another first-person fantasy role-playing game that so utterly captivated me with its world. I’ve seen some people grouse that it’s not as full-featured as the likes of <em>Skyrim</em>, but I actually <em>like </em>that about it! Developer Obsidian knew what it wanted to achieve with this game and focused its resources where they mattered most: on creating a world that’s fun and rewarding to explore; on developing combat that’s hard-hitting and offers all kinds of player agency; and on a narrative that has deeply developed themes, expressive choices, and the potential to experience significant consequences. I didn’t realize just how significant until I failed to prevent a catastrophe in the game’s second area, and you know what? I’m glad I made this huge mistake. Let me explain. <strong>(Spoilers concerning the second area of</strong><em><strong> Avowed</strong></em><strong> follow.)</strong><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-recommend-id="image://fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-format="png" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="SPOILER WARNING" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-recommend-id="image://fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-format="png" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="SPOILER WARNING" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Avowed</em>’s setting of the Living Lands<em> </em>is divided into five regions, or so I’ve been told. I’m still only in the third, as I’m really savoring my time with the game and trying to explore each area as thoroughly as possible before I move on to the next. In the second region, the captivating fungal forest known as the Emerald Stair, you visit the town of Fior mes Ivèrno. It’s no bustling metropolis or industrial capital but it’s a lovely settlement, one that clearly means a great deal to its residents who, in some cases, have roots there that go back generations. Your adventures in the region bring you into contact with many of them, including its mayor and a headstrong animancer who joins forces with you as you seek a way to cure the strange ailment plaguing the Living Lands and its people.</p><p>It’s also in this realm that a force known as the Steel Garrote comes into sharper focus. A military force which you might—I suppose—initially find guilty of nothing more than being coldly pragmatic in its approach to crisis management, here reveals itself to be genuinely ruthless. You can find this out in a few ways. I learned it in the most devastating way possible.</p><p>See, as I resolved a side quest in the Emerald Stair, a character told me that the Steel Garrote had an encampment nearby. She said something about them being in a cave behind a waterfall. My companion Kai even turned to me at this moment and said something like, “We should look into that.” I enthusiastically agreed, suspecting that the Steel Garrote were up to no good. The only problem is that I was only half paying attention to this NPC’s comments, and didn’t catch exactly <em>where </em>she said this cave behind a waterfall was. Oh well, I thought. I’ll just file that away in the back of my mind and look for caves behind each and every waterfall I come across in this region. I’m sure I’ll stumble upon it eventually.</p><figure id="" data-id="da1af9f488045c6d447ae26aae5c7d48" data-recommend-id="image://da1af9f488045c6d447ae26aae5c7d48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young woman speaks in front of a number of lit candles.

But I typically don’t look up things about games unless I’m completely stuck. I prefer to keep my experiences with games as organic as possible, and would much rather miss big things and fumble my way through a game than find everything and absolutely wipe the floor with enemies because I looked up a walkthrough or some game-breaking combat tips. That’s not to say I think people who do rely on walkthroughs are “doing it wrong,”—far from it. I think everyone should play games in the way that’s most enjoyable for them. For me, that’s just doing my best with little to no help or guidance and letting the chips fall where they may. Often, I’ll look up secrets <em>after </em>I’ve finished a game to find out about all the cool stuff I missed, but especially with a game like <em>Avowed</em>, in which so much of the joy for me comes from exploration and discovery, I try to hold off until then.</p><p>So I kept exploring the Emerald Stair, taking care of bounties and side quests, but never finding this cave in which the Steel Garrote were apparently hiding out. Finally, I tackled a main story mission that had my party delve into an ancient structure in the region, and just as we seemed to be wrapping things up there, the voice in my character’s head (whose identity I won’t reveal but who is connected to the land in some profound way) began to shriek in anguish and despair; it was clear that something was terribly wrong. Emerging from the depths and into the night, I could immediately see what had happened: there, on a distant hillside, Fior mes Ivèrno was burning!</p><p>As we ran to look for survivors, we encountered bands of Steel Garrote members trying to keep us from the vicinity, and I immediately knew those bastards were responsible. Worse, it was only then, by some cruel twist of fate, that I stumbled upon the cave where the Steel Garrote had been hiding, though now they were gone, and the only occupants of the cave were a group of xaurips that had moved in. As I explored, it became clear that if I’d only found the cave sooner and dealt with the Steel Garrote then, I could have saved Fior mes Ivèrno. It doesn’t have to burn. Maybe, for you, it didn’t, or it won’t. But for me, it did. And while of course I’m not “glad” that the town’s residents lost their home, I’m glad that as a player, I didn’t know what was coming, and that I failed to prevent it. It adds some delicious texture to my sense of my own character, and to my hatred of the Steel Garrote.</p><figure id="" data-id="0b5f4c985b675ccabdfe493c578cb961" data-recommend-id="image://0b5f4c985b675ccabdfe493c578cb961" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta is shown saying &quot;I will not forget Fior mes Iverno.

However, it doesn’t take long for you to start meeting people who, with good reason, don’t take too kindly to the idea of the Living Lands effectively becoming a colony of Aedyr. I wanted to role-play my own envoy as someone who came to the Living Lands with an open mind, but who eventually finds herself swayed to help the local people in whatever way she can, even if it means betraying her emperor and her orders.</p><p>The Steel Garrote are not officially representatives of the Aedyran empire, but they do seem to be broadly aligned with Aedyr in their goals of conquering or taming the Lands. And because they burned Fior mes Ivèrno, I’ve now gone from being suspicious of the Steel Garrote, to outright hating them, and it’s awesome. I love to hate these fuckers. It feels so good to see them in the world and take them out without hesitation or remorse. I haven’t relished fighting a particular enemy faction this much since the terrific writing in <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order </em>drove home that the Empire are irredeemable space-fascists who you should force-push off a cliff at every opportunity. I’m sure I’d still enjoy fighting the Steel Garrote if they hadn’t burned Fior mes Ivèrno, but the fact that they committed such an atrocity makes fighting them all the sweeter.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc7e1f026899e5a4b3a9ead389fd2e0f" data-recommend-id="image://dc7e1f026899e5a4b3a9ead389fd2e0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman in paladin-style armor named Captain Carnet says &quot;I have no reason to care what Fior thinks of us.

I don’t know where my character’s journey will end, but now she’s got one haunting tragedy in her past, one colossal failure to keep her up at night. For me, that’s a fascinating part of her story, one that drives her all the more to prevent any more innocents in the Living Lands from suffering needlessly at the hands of colonizers and tyrants. Did I mention I love this game?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-hidden-variable-autumn-games-legal-dispute<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>developer Hidden Variable has announced it will cease all work on the franchise owing to an ongoing legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiddenvariable.com/post/3ljotvjtpnk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/hidden-variable-ceases-development-on-skullgirls-ip-payment-dispute-publisher-autumn-games-seemingly-owes-1-2-million-to-hidden-variable.1126731/#post-136658811" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dgamemaster</a>), Hidden Variable says it is "no longer involved" in developing any&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>game, including&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls 2nd Encore</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls Mobile</em>, and "other&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>IP-related efforts".</p>

<p>The studio says it's in the middle of a dispute with Autumn Games which has been escalated to "litigation filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court", and that it won't be providing further comment on the matter until said issue is resolved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=ipJVsscE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=l5GLWkQ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>studio Hidden Variable is embroiled in a legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Hidden Variable says it won't be commenting on the matter, dgamemaster sought out the <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/240911937/complaint" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">legal document</a> filed by the studio, and it looks as though the dispute comes down to missed payments.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hidden Variable appears to be alleging that Autumn Games failed to pay it a number of times between November and now, with payments amounting to $1.23m due to Hidden Variable on Autumn Games' behalf.</p>

<p>The developer says Autumn's actions were intentional, and that the publisher was intending to find a new developer for the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>games after it "unsuccessfully sought to sell its business".&nbsp;Ouch.</p>

<p>According to dgamemaster's post, Autumn Games has said that it intends to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>despite the dispute, but it hasn't specified which of the games it will be updating, nor when new updates will be made available.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=r2hSSRn3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=XiFBQ8T7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>might still get updates, although we don't know when.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>has run into a spot of bother. Back in 2020, Autumn Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-publisher-kicks-lab-zero-games-off-project" rel="nofollow">kicked original developer Lab Zero off the IP</a>&nbsp;following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/More-Victimized-Employees-Leave-Lab-Zero-Mike-Z" rel="nofollow">allegations made against that studio's head Mike Zaimont</a>.</p>

<p>Following those allegations, Zaimont subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-z-lays-off-all-remaining-lab-zero-games-employees" rel="nofollow">laid off all remaining Lab Zero employees</a>, with former staff going on to create a new studio by the name of Future Club. That studio would then work on&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/former-lab-zero-devs-partner-with-hidden-variable-for-skullgirls-content" rel="nofollow">DLC</a>, thus completing the cycle.</p>

<p>The future of the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently unclear, although it sounds like Autumn Games intends to continue working on at least one of the games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> might release at Christmas according to Khary Payton, who voices the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a> in the upcoming World War 2-set action game. It's the first morsel of release info we've garnered for Rise Of Hydra since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">announcement last March</a>, which tantalised with the prospect of playing USO Show-era Steve Rogers and Azzuri, great-grandfather to the current Black Panther.
</p>
<p>
In the works at Skydance New Media alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amy-hennig-is-making-a-new-star-wars-game-again">an untitled Star Wars game</a>, Rise Of Hydra had been slated to launch in 2025. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Payton suggested that it might be a holiday release, landing after Call Of Duty season and just in time for the nostalgic yuletide period. "We're still working," he hummed and hypothesised. "We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." 
</p>
<p>
I'm not wildly keen myself to play another Marvel game. The expanded Marvel universe as it stands is a kaleidoscopic hangover following the success of the Avengers movies, with no clear heir to the throne just yet. Nor am I especially happy to be back in the shoes of OG Steve Rogers, a recruitment poster character rescued from his own can-do heroism by Chris Evans knowing how to do comedy. Yeah, you comicbook readers probably have a more nuanced take on Marvel's current activities. By all means come at me.
</p>
<p>
I'll forgive Rise Of Hydra all that, though, because Skydance New Media's president is former Naughty Dog creative director Amy Hennig, and she directed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. I will forgive Amy Hennig anything, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to brain me with a vase, filch my debit card and blow my life savings on Fantastic Four figurines, I would tell the police not to stress about it, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to tunnel back through time and humiliate me elaborately by inviting my favourite Sonic The Comic artist to come see me fall into a cauldron of stale baked beans while being rejected by my primary school sweetheart, I would sob gratefully in the knowledge that one day, Amy Hennig is going to direct Soul Reaver. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps she will even work on another Soul Reaver game, if we can only get her through the Marvel period in her career.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The horror game market continues to thrive and 2025’s schedule is lining up a multi-course meal of fear-inducing, hair-reducing cowering and crying. 2025 has a myriad of big horror games from well-known sequels to potential breakout hits.</p>



<p>I find horror in games makes films look like child’s play—and I don’t mean any dangerous dolls. A movie forces you to watch what happens, whereas in a game, <em>you </em>are responsible for the action unfolding. <em>You </em>have to push your character along, advance the narrative, and trigger jumpscares and premeditated psychological horror.</p>



<p>It’s daunting when you think about it, yet players can’t get enough. To appease the morbid curiosity in all of us, here’s a list of the biggest upcoming horror games in 2025, sure to scare and scar you one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-horror-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Horror Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Many of these 2025 horror game release dates could be subject to change.</strong> The volatility of the game industry and sudden technical problems means any title is a delay away from a 2026 or 2027 release date. That being said, let’s get into it.</p>



<h3 id="h-directive-8020">Directive 8020</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unsettling. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Supermassive Games is one of the pioneers of the horror genre in the last 15 years. The acclaimed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-teaser-released-ahead-of-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a> kickstarted this Hall of Fame-worthy horror march. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/directive-8020-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Directive 8020</a> is the latest in The Dark Pictures Anthology—featuring The Quarry, Little Hope, and others—and features the series’ trademarks. Expect to tackle sudden quick-time events and critical story-changing decisions while you explore the unknown of the Cassiopeia.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’re ready for more mutations. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light The Beast</a> brings back OG protagonist Kyle Crane as we embark on another adventure of parkour and parasitical purgatory. The Beast is a separate sequel from Dying Light 2, and <a href="https://techland.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Techland</a> is looking to bring together a more compact and equally chaotic experience. As before, Dying Light The Beast’s world is a terrifying ordeal during the day and almost unsurvivable at night. You’ll need to unlock the beast within to help Crane rise high.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Can’t we be friends? Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Imagine Call of Duty Zombies’ renowned round-based gameplay, but with even faster, more vicious, and grotesque enemies. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is the meaner and nastier undead sibling in the zombies family and builds on Killing Floor 2’s good work. The M.E.A.T system is back to delight and disgust, and the new Zed design is likely to put you off your tea—sick bags on stand by.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Phew, someone by my side. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>2025 is proving to be a big year for Supermassive Games as the developer is pulling double duty. Developer Tarsier Studios has moved onto pastures new, and someone needed to pick up the remnants of the beloved franchise. In steps Supermassive Games to deliver <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-platforms-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> and bring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-little-nightmares-3-multiplayer-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op multiplayer</a> in a series first. We have a new developer, new main characters in Low and Alone, and reasons to be thankful and fearful.</p>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Excited for this one. Credit to Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>We segue nicely to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—the new IP from Little Nightmares 1 and 2 developer Tarsier Studios. Even from the screenshot above you can see an uncanny resemblance and deliberate inspiration for the horror title. Unsurprisingly, you need to solve puzzles, escape and avoid unspeakable enemies, and it also includes co-operative play in case you need to squeeze the hand of the person next to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been long enough. Credit to Undead Labs</figcaption></figure>



<p>Full disclosure: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Decay 3</a> MIGHT not be releasing in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s currently the only entry on this list in serious jeopardy of this deadline. A potential delay to 2026 or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027</a> is on the cards, so bear this in mind, but no one truly knows. If it releases in 2025, developer Undead Labs has likely put all its infected blood, sweat, and tears into it. There’s a healthy development cycle between each State of Decay release, and the 2024 Xbox Showcase footage we saw of State of Decay 3 heightens survival, and the game demands your time, respect, and attention. </p>



<h3 id="h-the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Got a light? Credit to MoonHood</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just looking at The Midnight Walk makes me anxious. It’s ingenious, stop-motion clay-orientated horror works so well because it’s seldom seen. Its art styles alone make me want to play it. If you dare to jump into The Midnight Walk, you’ll need to do more than walk around to survive the antagonistic threat of monsters.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Why do I even bother? Credit to Frogwares</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Sinking City 2 is a sequel and another special loveletter to Lovecraftian themes. Unlike escape and survival, like many entries on our best and biggest horror games 2025 list, you can attack in The Sinking City 2. But you also need to venture into the deepest recesses of your brain to engage your deductive reasoning senses. The sequel builds upon the original’s detective mechanics, and happens to throw a 200ft monster or two at you in the process. Sherlock Holmes didn’t have to deal with this!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-shows-off-foldable-handheld-thats-basically-a-switch-you-can-bend-in-half.1126800/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/samsung-shows-off-foldable-handheld-thats-basically-a-switch-you-can-bend-in-half<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Technology giant Samsung has shown off a working concept for a foldable gaming handheld - and it's essentially a Nintendo Switch that you can bend in half. 
</p>
<p>
Ever tried to snap your Switch in rage? Well, now you can do that with the Samsung Flex Gaming concept and (hopefully) not break the device in the process.
</p>
<p>
While just a concept, Samsung had workable units on show at the MWC mobile technology event in Barcelona this week, with foldable OLED screens up and running. Just ignore the big crease down the middle.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Samsung Display concept is basically a foldable Nintendo Switch!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfgIVX0ZBk4?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Perhaps just as notable, the Samsung Flex Gaming concept also includes two giant holes in each of its not-Joy-Con. These are designed to allow the control stick in each side of the handheld to fit snugly inside the other half.
</p>
<p>
Cleverly, the face button and D-Pad have been built into the edges of each hole - again replicating the placement of these buttons on Nintendo Switch.
</p>
<p>
The device even has different colours for each half, as the original Switch had for its model with Blue/Red Joy-Con. Samsung's choices are lime green and yellow though - not as attractive, though very Norwich City FC.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is expected to not offer an OLED screen in its upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> (or allow you to bend it in half). The Mario maker is set to unveil more details of its next handheld in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">special Nintendo Direct presentation scheduled for 2nd April</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sometimes, it's really hard to let some things go, even for a legendary game creator such as Hideki Kamiya, who seems to have some trouble forgetting the <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/">canceled Xbox exclusive Scalebound.</a></p>
<p>In a new studio update video from Clovers, Kamiya-san's new development studio, which is currently working on an Okami sequel in collaboration with CAPCOM, the creator of the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta series, among other excellent action games, was shown reminiscing about Scalebound while looking at footage and trailers shared online back when the game was still in active development. Despite the project having been canceled eight years ago, it still holds an important place in Kamiya-san's heart, as he would love to make it again someday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Let’s do it, Phil ! 😀 <a href="https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt">https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt</a></p>
<p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1896473842950041682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Microsoft seems interested in resuming old partnerships with Japanese development studios, as shown earlier this year with the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4 and the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, there could be some interest from the publisher in working together with Hideki Kamiya's new studio for another project which could incorporate some of the features that the legendary creator liked so much in Scalebound. Since the project has only been briefly mentioned a couple of times since its cancelation, and not in <a href="https://wccftech.com/scalebound-rough-development-missed-milestones-stopped-payments-kamiya-takes-time-health/">the best of lights</a>, however, it definitely feels like that ship has sailed, never to come back.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, Hideki Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, is working on a new entry in the Okami series in collaboration with CAPCOM. The game, which will be released on PC and consoles on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date, will be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">RE Engine</a>, which is allowing the studio to fully realize Kamiya-san's vision.</p>

<p>The update was released earlier today, but two of its biggest additions won't be going live until tomorrow: the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event and the Clone Rumble game mode.</p>

<p>First up, Clone Rumble is a new mode that allows you and your teammates all to play as the same hero. If you've ever wondered what six Mr. Fantastics or six Rocket Raccoons could accomplish in a <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>match, this mode is for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=Ux31xIdJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=V38OQTBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new Clone Rumble update looks set to cause chaos.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will only be available across three distinct three-day time periods, though. You'll be able to check it out between tomorrow and March 10th, and it'll then be available again from March 14th-March 17th and March 21st-March 24th.</p>

<p>As well as Clone Rumble, you can also check out the new Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, which launches tomorrow as well. Joining the event will net you an exclusive Black Widow outfit for free, and this event runs until April 11th, so the time period isn't as limited as Clone Rumble.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect plenty of optimizations and gameplay tweaks in this update. It's well worth checking out the full&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Clone Rumble update so you can stay up-to-date on what's going on.</p>




<p>It's been a strange few months for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The game launched back in December and reached <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million registered players</a> within just 72 hours, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">break the 40 million barrier</a> by NetEase's last count.</p>

<p>However, that didn't stop the Chinese gaming giant from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">unexpectedly closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing the game. I guess nobody is really safe from the recent wave of industry cuts and layoffs, unfortunately.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010451" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>
Xbox owners enrolled into the Xbox Insider program are reporting that their consoles are being reset back to factory settings by a new update.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Insider program allows users to receive new system features early, and is split into various 'tiers' for how new and/or buggy they want these features to be when they receive them. 
</p>
<p>
Users in the earliest Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers say the latest console update is removing their Xbox profiles, console settings and Quick Resume data (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-latest-system-update-for-xbox-insiders-is-removing-their-user-profiles/">VGC</a>) - and has now been made a mandatory download, so cannot be skipped.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Insider program has been running for 15 years, but an issue this big is extremely rare. The scheme's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/">dedicated reddit is awash with complaints</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/serious_preview_update_bug_factory_reset/">one user calling it</a> the "biggest bug I've ever seen release in all my years of being in the preview program".
</p>
<p>"This one actually factory reset my Series X," another user wrote. "It must've updated today and now my console is requiring me to set it up as brand new."
</p>
<p>"Light a candle for the guy here with a broken HDMI port and relies on remote play," wrote another. "Update messed everything up and now I cannot remote to my Series X, can't even see what is going on."</p>
<p>
While users can re-sign into their profiles and manually change back their settings, anyone impacted will lose time (and need to remember their passwords, including to any media apps).
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You can now lease a PS5, along with the likes of a PS VR2 set and Sony's handheld remote player PlayStation Portal, here in the UK.</p>
<p>This leasing service debuted in Japan, and quickly became a hit. As Ed reported this morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">GEO's PS5 rental service in Japan is fully booked across its 400 stores nationwide</a>. It's been a monster (hunter) success, you could say.</p>
<p>And now, it is our turn. Sony's <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing">PS Direct UK website</a> lets you rent a digital-only PS5 for £11/month, or a PS5 with a disc drive for £12/month. Stump up £19/month and you can rent a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. If you want a PS VR2, it's £18.50/month - or £20/month if you want access to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-call-mountain">Horizon: Call of the Mountain</a> too. PlayStation Portal is £6.50/month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those interested in going down the lease route can choose a 12, 24, or 36-month term contract, although there is also a rolling monthly option if that's more your thing. As for the products available through the service, you will be able to rent the following PlayStation items:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro Console</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console - Two DualSense Wireless Controllers Bundle (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Console - Two DualSense Wireless Controllers Bundle (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation Portal Remote Player</li>
<li>PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</li>
<li>PlayStation VR2</li>
<li>DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/support/leasing">FAQ section on the website</a>, Sony states all lease agreements are made exclusively with Raylo. "All transactions, communications, and support services related to your device lease will be provided directly by Raylo," the page reads. "If you've signed up to a lease through PlayStation leasing and you have any issues with your device or your lease, you should contact Raylo for support in the first instance."</p>
<p>It also states Raylo offers a fair wear and tear policy on the leased hardware.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Raylo offer a fair wear and tear policy," Sony states. "It's ok to return your device with obvious signs of use such as a couple of deep scratches, small dents, discolouration or changes in the paintwork."</p>
<p>So, are you tempted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has now announced official details for this summer's Go Fest event series, which will include the global release of a Pokémon previously locked behind paid City Safari meetups.
</p>
<p>
As detailed previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">Go Fest 2025 will hold in-person events in Paris, Jersey City and Osaka</a> through late May and June. These will lead to the game's global Go Fest, which is now confirmed to take place on 28th and 29th June.
</p>
<p>
Today, Niantic confirmed Go Fest this year will see the release of Crowned Sword Zacian and Crowned Shield Zamazenta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-next-mythical-pokemon-teased-in-go-fest-logo">which players had deduced from this year's leaked Go Fest logo</a>. In a surprise, the event's main Mythical creature will be Volcanion, however - not Megearna as previously suspected. 
</p>
<p>
And in another surprise, it's been confirmed that Pokémon Go Fest Global will include the wider release of Skiddo, the cute goat creature you'd previously need to travel to City Safari event to capture. 
</p>
<p>
Through 2023 and 2024, Skiddo was only available if you visited Seoul, Barcelona, Mexico City, Tainan, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo at specific times. 
</p>
<p>
2025's City Safari events - so far confirmed for Milan, Singapore and Mumbai - now feature donkey Pokémon Mudbray as their new exclusive, signalling a wider release for Skiddo was on the cards.
</p>
<p>
This year may well include other changes to Pokémon Go, depending on the outcome of the game's reported sale. Last month, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Niantic was planning to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a> - a move which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">stoked concern amongst players due to Scopely's aggressive monetisation strategy</a> seen after it has taken over other mobile games.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.
</p>
<p>
Epic is seeking unspecified damages from Illinois Fortnite fan Isaac "i5aac" Strock for fraud, copyright infringement and unjust enrichment.
</p>
<p>
Strock is named in a <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2025-02-27-epic-v--strock-complaint-5a69b553b2a2.pdf">legal filing dated 27th February</a>, which <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025">Epic Games has also publicised via a recent blog post</a> - its latest move to name and shame those who target Fortnite with unscrupulous practices.
</p>
<p>
"Strock is in the business of stealing access to other players' Epic Games accounts," Epic Games wrote in its court filing. 
</p>
<p>
"He uses illicit means to discover the players' usernames and passwords and in some cases even the login credentials for the players' email address associated with the players' Epic Games account. He then sells access to these accounts to the highest bidders."
</p>
<p>
Epic Games estimates Strock has sold "hundreds" of player accounts and says he has boasted online about reaping "thousands of dollars in profits".
</p>
<p>
Strock is said to have even offered a guide on how to cheat Epic Games' player support and steal more accounts - again, for a price. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games detected Strock on multiple occasions trying to bamboozle its player support with requests to change log-in details and gain access to accounts with valuable cosmetics or that had already been pre-loaded with Fortnite in-game currency.
</p>
<p>
Strock also used email and password combinations acquired in data breaches via the dark web to further add to his stolen account haul, the legal filing states.
</p>
<p>
The online trade in Fortnite accounts is lucrative, and accounts with rare skins are highly prized. Epic Games notes that some individual accounts sell for over $1000 each.
</p>
<p>
"Strock's actions harm Epic and the Fortnite community," the company concluded. "Epic has spent substantial resources investigating and working to prevent Strock's conduct. Strock's conduct also directly harms Fortnite players who no longer have access to the accounts they spent time and money on.
</p>
<p>
"Epic is entitled to all remedies available at law or equity, including injunctive relief, compensatory damages and/or other equitable or monetary remedies."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Epic Games announced its victory against a Fortnite competitive cheater who had tried to sneak their way into the game's biggest tournament</a>. Epic took back the player's winnings, forced them to post humiliating public apology video and then donated the prize money to charity.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Many of the Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues on PC may have become a thing of the past, thanks to a new version of a popular mod available for all games powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, modder Praydog released a new version of the REFramework mod, which significantly reduces the micro-stuttering issues caused by the game's anti-tamper tech by preventing constant scanning. The mod also addresses some crashing issues caused by DRM as well. You can find this new version of the mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, but if you're having issues with it like other users are reporting, you can use any of the previous nightly builds available on <a href="https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> that seem to be more stable as of now.</p>
<p>Performance issues aren't the only issues that impact the Monster Hunter Wilds experience, as the low challenge level for the story and a good portion of the postgame High Rank can be a little offputting for those who mastered previous generation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. Thankfully, some mods are already available to address the low challenge level of the game, allowing hunters to<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/"> increase both monsters' health and attack power.</a></p>
<p>The above issues aside, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly among the finest entries in the series. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
