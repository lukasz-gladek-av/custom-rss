            <guid>1403341</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Google Pixel 9a Android smartphone features a 6.3-inch Actua display, a Google Tensor G4 processor, built-in Gemini AI capabilities, and an IP68-rated body. It also comes with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, making for a seamless experience for users who want to stream, browse, and switch between applications continuously. Additionally, there is an Adaptive Battery designed to provide more than 30 hours of usage time, a durable frame, and seven years of OS and security updates, ensuring users feel they have a powerful phone for an extended period.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">Amazon has discounted the Google Pixel 9a from its typical price of $499 to $399, giving you a 20% savings of $100.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2><span>A powerful smartphone perfect for casual and advanced users</span></h2>
<p><span>The 6.3-inch display on the Google Pixel 9a provides enough space to show both your apps and videos comfortably, yet it’s still small enough to hold comfortably in your hand. The display also supports adaptive refresh rates, reaching a maximum of 120Hz when swiping quickly, and lowering back to conserve battery life when viewing static content.</span></p>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a is powered by the Tensor G4 processor, with 8 GB of memory and 128 GB of internal storage. You can easily keep multiple applications open and switch between social media platforms, maps, and video content simultaneously while running AI-based features in the background, without delays or freezes. Gemini was integrated to provide summaries of web pages, compose simple responses, or retrieve information from your Google Apps using voice commands. The Pixel UI and continued software support for Android 16 mean you can expect frequent new features and security patches for many years to come.</p>



<p>Google has developed a camera app for the Google Pixel 9a that uses AI-based algorithms to convert quick snapshots into higher-quality photographs with minimal effort on your part. You can take portraits, low-light pictures, and quick-action shots, and use the “Best Take” feature along with “Add Me” to ensure the correct positioning of subjects’ faces within a single frame.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a’s battery life, protection, and call features are designed to let you use the device heavily without having to check the remaining battery life frequently. The Adaptive Battery is intended to last longer than 30 hours, and when activated, the Extreme Battery Saver will further extend the battery life. The phone also carries an IP68 rating, allowing it to withstand dust, water spills, and brief submersion, and includes various safety measures to protect your data against theft, vehicle accidents, phishing scams, and other potential threats. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">For $399 on sale, down from the regular retail price of $499, you can enjoy a bright 6.3-inch screen, advanced AI features, dependable camera systems, and extended software support in a well-balanced mobile device.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new official Palworld card game has been announced, scheduled to release on July 30, 2026. </p>



<p>The game that was dubbed Pokémon with Guns, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued by Pokémon and Nintendo</a>, still seems to be following the same path, with a new Palworld TCG announced. It is being developed by Bushiroad, known for card games such as Cardfight!! Vanguard, Weiß Schwarz, and many more. </p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-tcg-arrives-july-2026">Palworld TCG Arrives July 2026</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://en.palworld-official-cardgame.com/news/post-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> reveals that Bushiroad has announced a brand-new trading card game (TCG) based on Pocketpair’s highly popular title, Palworld. The card game will be released on July 20, 2026, allowing players to take part in 2-player competitive battles, using different strategies and tactics to deploy their favourite Pals. Players will be able to gather resources and build bases as they leverage their Pals’ unique traits to secure victory. </p>



<p>Palworld has faced Pokémon rip-off allegations since its announcement, with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company suing the developers for patent infringement. Announcing a new TCG based around Palworld, knowing full well that Pokémon is a dominating name in that space, is not going to help it beat those allegations. However, TCG is not a realm meant solely for creature-based games; in recent years, we have also seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-tcg-announced-by-cdpr-and-wierdco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like Cyberpunk 2077</a> enter this realm.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute was being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reexamined</a> by the USPTO. Additionally, the developers have addressed the possibility of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-addresses-story-based-future-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing a story-based game</a> in the future. What are your thoughts on Palworld TCG? Do you think the Pokémon rip-off allegations will grow even more?

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Call of Duty is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. That we know for sure. Key Xbox and Activision figures have underlined how important Nintendo's hardware is for the brand moving forward, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">their last comments on the matter</a> happening last year following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a>'s reveal.</p>
<p>The more important question, now, is <em>when</em> that's actually happening. We've heard all sorts of rumblings over the last few months, with insiders and other industry figures pointing to a big release coming at some point in 2026. Now, a datamine (via Reality <a href="https://x.com/realityuk">on X/Twitter</a>) could point to it happening sooner rather than later.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>

<p>The account has a history of looking through Call of Duty files and the latest updates, and shared this new finding on 11th January. Several lines added with a recent Call of Duty HQ (the dreadful multi-game launcher the series has been using for years now) reference the Nintendo "platform family" and "account type" along consoles and PC platforms that have access to the games already.</p><p>Though the news isn't a shock, it's still good to see work on whatever Call of Duty game is coming first to Nintendo Switch 2 (and maybe the original Switch, too) hasn't stalled. Other live-service hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> have enjoyed a great deal of success there, and with a handful of recent Switch 2 ports raising the bar for ambitious third-party efforts, it's not hard to see Call of Duty finding gold on Nintendo's hybrid console(s), too.</p>
<p>That said, we'd recommend proceeding with caution for now, as the shared datamine also references the Ubisoft Connect platform, which (at least right now) isn't selling the Call of Duty games. Activision's devs could be including those references and tags in the files for whatever reason, and the same could apply to the Nintendo lines. We know that CoD is taking aim at Nintendo straight from the horse's mouth though, so we're just sitting here waiting for the Direct stream that finally confirms what's been in the works for a very long time. Watch this space.</p>

<figure data-uuid="8e1e52e2c736d"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8e1e52e2c736d/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been the subject of much debate since its launch last year, with many speculating that the current economy might necessitate a price increase for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a>, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa has remained coy on any potential product price increases, simply stating "I cannot comment on hypotheticals". Seems like a pretty understandable statement to make; Furukawa won't want to cause any panic by insinuating that prices may indeed go up.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Kyoto Shinbun article is locked behind a paid subscription model, so the kind folks at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w2yyporceaqxdbzfupn5lcbt/post/3mc5ut4rnmk2f">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> have highlighted some of the key points from the interview. In addition to Furukawa's comment on price rises, he also noted that the current memory prices – which are on the rise thanks to the huge requirement needed for AI chips – will have "no immediate impact on [Nintendo's] financial performance", but he will nevertheless monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>In slightly lighter news, Furukawa confirmed that Nintendo is working on both established franchises and completely new content, which probably won't come a a massive surprise. He also reaffirms Nintendo's desire to expand its work in the movie space, while noting that a potential venture into anime isn't completely ruled out.</p>
<p>We're not surprised to see such vague answers from Furukawa, since getting any sort of comment from Nintendo is like getting blood from a stone. Regardless, it's nice to get at least a <em>bit</em> of context as we head into the new year.</p>

			<p>It is about time some fresh 3D platformers to turn up, bringing with them fresh ideas and new ways to enjoy the genre. Big Hops is a game that comes with some big and fun new ideas, like using a frog tongue as a grapple to latch onto points and to grab items from the environment, and using different plants for fun ways to get around the world. But as it’s leaping from platform to plant, jumping through the world, can it stick the landing?</p>
<p><iframe title="BIG HOPS - Announce Trailer | A new kind of 3D platformer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bd7WIf1peRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Big Hops follows the story of a young frog called Hop who lives his simple, quiet life in the forest with his sister and mum. However, he soon hears a voice calling to him away from his usual stomping grounds to a shrine where he is asked to bring some things to fix the altar. Unfortunately, the voice belongs to the being known as Diss who whisks Hop away to different worlds where he must find Dark Drips to assist Diss, as well as Airship Parts to get back home. The lesson here is that you shouldn’t listen to disembodied voices promising a good time – embodied voices can also be pretty problematic.</p>


<p>Hop visits three very different worlds from his home, including a desert inhabited by rabbit people, an island chain inhabited by otters, and a mountain inhabited by bats. Diss brings Hop to each of these places because there is conflict at each one which draws in the Dark Drips. In the desert, the regular townsfolk are in conflict with a gang, in the islands it is a between one person and the oil company DrillCo, and in the mountains it is punks railing against authority. Three very different conflicts and each one is presented decently, with a wide cast of characters that are brought to life by good voice performances. Each of the locations also look great, filled with vibrant colour and well mapped environments that show where you need to go, but letting you test different ways of getting to points of interest.</p>


<p>Big Hops gameplay has the classic hallmarks of 3D platformers providing open spaces to explore to find collectables, solve puzzles, and assist people in their endeavours. Where Big Hops differs is through its traversal and puzzle solving. As Hop is a frog he has a long and powerful tongue that can latch onto surfaces allowing him to swing across gaps, pull levers from a distance, pick locks, and even engage in a bit of light graffiti.</p>
<p>As if his tongue wasn’t enough, Hops can also make use of a number of plants and vegetables, each of which has its own properties and affect the way you can navigate the world. Mushrooms can be used as bounce pad, a cacti plant can create rope crossings, and the flux plant creates zones of low gravity. These are just three of a wider number of plants that can be used to solve puzzles and find different ways of getting around, though some are exclusive to each area. Hop does get a backpack to store these items in, but space is limited so you won’t be able to carry every plant with you.</p>

<p>In each area, Hop has to try to resolve the local conflict to find the airship parts he needs and to move on to the next world. Much of the gameplay consists of solving big puzzles, usually three, to unlock the path to move forward. There are also secondary tasks available to tackle, but they are not required to move on. Your focus is looking for Dark Drips and solving the issues of the region.</p>
<p>Dark Drips are needed to unlock additional bonuses for Hop, be it additional stamina for climbing, more health, or compasses to locate more Drips in the world. Every time you find a Dark Drip you can take it back to Diss and choose between two bonuses. I wouldn’t agonise too much over the choice as you will eventually get all of them. The worlds also contain hidden challenge rooms where you have to use what you have learned in that world to navigate treacherous paths to grab a Dark Drip.</p>

<p>I initially really enjoyed my time with Big Hops and there are some really fun moments, but through the review period we did run into a number of issues on PS5. One area had stuttering performance, there was some clipping through the environment, skipping music, and more significantly some game crashes and progression-blocking issues. Patches arrived before launch to address most of these, allowing me to finish the game, though I wasn’t able to return to previous areas and did still run into a glitch that locked me into a first person view – this resolved itself when I failed the level. Hopefully remaining issues at launch are patched quickly, because they did detract from my experience of an otherwise charming game.</p>

			<p>A few weeks after <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">RAM prices</strong> started spiking due to increased demand from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI data centers</strong> which will take some time to normalize, the critical situation for consumers (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">who apparently have gotten the narrative wrong</a></strong>) has now become evident, as prices for some devices have already been increased, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/"><strong>more are set to follow.</strong></a></p>



<p>Obviously, video game consoles will also be impacted by the current RAM prices and shortages, and another price increase will make the current console generation even more unusual, as it is the first one to date where console prices increased instead of dropping in the years following their launch. For the time being, however, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> may not be impacted by the current unprecedented situation.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a></em> in a new interview</strong> summarized by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Patents Watch</a></em></strong>, president <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Shuntaro Furukawa</strong> commented on the impact the current high RAM prices could have on the new generation Nintendo system, saying that components are <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"procured from suppliers based on Nintendo's medium to long term business plan,"</em> and, as such, the current memory price has no immediate impact on their financial performance and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> price should remain stable for the near future.</p>



<p>However, given the magnitude of the situation, no one can rest easy. <em>"We must monitor the situation closely,"</em> said <strong>Furukawa-san</strong> before refusing to <em>"comment on hypotheticals"</em> regarding a possible price increase for the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Although high RAM prices make any new hardware launch challenging, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo</strong> could be planning a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 Lite</strong> model. During the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kyoto Shimbun</em></strong> interview, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Furukawa-san</strong> mentioned that the company wants to make the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> accessible to people <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"who pick up their first console when reaching a certain age."</em> A cheaper <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2 Lite</strong> model would definitely appeal to a younger crowd but it remains to be seen how affordable such a system would be in the current landscape.</p>



<p>With no slowdown in sight for the AI boom, purchasing a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in the near future seems to be the safest choice for those still looking to get the system. In the future, Nintendo may eventually face a difficult choice: take a hit to its margins to protect the current price point, or <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">follow </strong></a><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a></strong> in increasing the system's price after its launch.</p>

            <p>Happy Mawday all! This week, I'm thinking about how we can expand our bestiary of Maw manifestations. When describing the beast, we often resort to stock Lovecraftian imagery of a kaleidoscopic kerfuffle of teeth and tentacles, but the Maw’s appearances aren’t always so pulpy and cinematic. Sometimes, it just looks like a blinking cursor, or an expectant child, or a feeling of guilt about not returning a text message from an old friend. Sometimes, it looks like an audience of people who want to read about new PC games. 
</p>
<p>Come, depress yourself with me as we tot up possible indicators of Maw activity. Alternatively, read about some of those aforesaid new PC games. Thanks very much to Editor King Julian for suggesting the majority of titles on this list, which he has been doing with disturbing efficiency of late. 
</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 12th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221480/Big_Hops/">Big Hops</a> is a 3D platformer featuring a frog who is given to both the titular big hops and also, tongue-based gymnastics. I guess Big Tongue would have sent the wrong signals as a title.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797960/Confidential_Killings__A_Detective_Game/">Confidential Killings - A Detective Game</a> is definitely a game that could have done with a better title. You might as well call Mass Effect “Space Shootings &amp; Shaggings – An RPG”. Oh no, I think I’ve just talked myself into this.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quarantine-zone-the-last-check">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</a> is a game about playing a border guard during a zombie apocalypse that has the strong potential to be either a Papers, Please-style moral experiment or a crass and gaudy fantasy about brutalising migrants, and is perhaps worth us writing about in either case.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 13th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Out this week in early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is the previously Riot Games-published sandbox building RPG, now in the hands of the Minecraft Hypixel server founders at Hypixel Studios. This could be Big, though I’m not sure the world needs another cousin of Minecraft with Robloxy game creation platform aspirations.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937880/Hank_Drowning_On_Dry_Land/">Hank: Drowning on Dry Land</a> (pictured) is a caped debacle in which you play drunk, time-travelling pseudo-Batman trying to escape from a comicbook world. Julian picked this one out in our morning meeting for being a budget experimental immersive sim, akin to Blendo’s recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 14th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fez fans ahoy! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cassette-boy">Cassette Boy</a> is an action RPG puzzler in which you can spin the world to reveal things or remove them from existence. I like the old school Nintendo handheld visuals and the guiding meditation on object permanence.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707870/Streetdog_BMX/">Streetdog BMX</a> is six colourful 3D maps' worth of kids doing frightfully Tony Hawkish things on bicycles. Seriously, how do any of these mad children still have groins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 15th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316940/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_beyond_the_Horizon/">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> is the thirteenth instalment in an apparently brilliant RPG series I am resigned to never being able to play before the sun implodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3538860/Tabulo/">Tabulo</a> is the latest Balatro-like, which is to say, the latest snazzy application of roguelite mechanics to a concept that was getting on quite well enough without - in this case, chess</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">Craftlings</a> is… Lemmings, the ancient Psygnosis game in which you try stop critters walking off clifftops, but it’s also a colony building sim, with mines and airships and monsters? This is a truly terrifying piece of retro alchemy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 16th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3459150/The_Fortress/">The Fortress</a> is a first-person turn-based dungeon-crawling RPG in the tradition of Eye of the Beholder and Legend of Grimrock. You’ve been locked up by the Sorceror King. Please attempt to get out.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973060/NEUROXUS/">NEUROXUS</a> is a dizzy third-person mech shooter that looks like Armored Core 6 but more neon.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525060/Moving_Simulator/">Moving Simulator</a> is, as you may deduce, a moving house simulator, though I guess that could also be “moving” as in emotive. Perhaps it’s both? Moving house tends to be pretty moving.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2547090/Lunar_Ascendant/">Lunar Ascendant</a> is about playing politics as the very first mayor of the Moon. You will monitor social media, bandy words with representatives of various factions, and figure out your relationship to an Earth now run by super-advanced AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things afoot this week: James and Julian have some preview events to attend. Mark and Ollie are gunning for a bit of that Hytale launch excitement, among other things, and I’m trying to turn around a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> review, after only getting code on Friday.</p><p>The Maw’s manifestations may diversify and fracture into ubiquity but we Leech Wizards of games journalism will always be here to intercept its dreadful advance and woo the creature with some absolute gibberish about, I don’t know, overpowered shoes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> or something. Let the cry ring forth once again from the battlements: FEED THE MAW!</p>

            <guid>1403293</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="547">As the calendar flips to a brand-new year and the rush of holiday shopping fades into the background, many people find themselves holding onto gift cards or leftover holiday cash, wondering what worthwhile purchase to make next. If you’re looking to invest in something practical, versatile, and genuinely useful year-round, a portable power station is an excellent place to start. One standout option right now is the Jackery Explorer 300, a compact yet capable power solution that is now part of a limited-time Amazon discount.</p>
<p data-start="549" data-end="829"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/">Normally priced at $259, the Jackery Explorer 300 is currently available for just $179, marking a 31% price drop and a solid $80 in savings</a>. For anyone who’s been on the fence about adding a portable power station to their gear collection, this deal might just push you onto the buying side.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="831" data-end="1327">A portable power station is one of those items you might not realize you need until you really need it. Whether you’re planning outdoor adventures or simply want peace of mind at home, something like the the Jackery Explorer 300 is a must in both scenarios. It’s ideal for camping trips, road travel, tailgating, or even backyard gatherings where access to outlets is limited. At the same time, it’s a smart emergency backup to keep in your car or garage for unexpected power outages or roadside situations.</p>

<p data-start="1329" data-end="1670">Weighing just 7.1 pounds, the Explorer 300 is super lightweight for the power it delivers. The integrated top handle makes it easy to grab and go, whether you’re heading into the wilderness or pulling it out during a blackout. Despite its compact size, it packs enough energy to keep essential devices running when you need them most.</p>
<h2 data-start="1329" data-end="1670">Universal Connectivity</h2>
<p data-start="1672" data-end="2128">The Jackery Explorer 300 can power up to six devices at once, making it a great option for families or group trips. It includes two AC outlets for larger electronics, a 60W Power Delivery USB-C port for fast-charging modern laptops and phones, a USB 3.0 fast-charge port, a standard USB-A port, and a DC car port. This variety ensures that nearly any device you own can be powered or recharged without hassle.</p>


<p data-start="2130" data-end="2530">In terms of performance, the Explorer 300 delivers reliable results. On a full charge, it can run a mini cooler or a television for approximately 4.5 hours. It can recharge smaller devices multiple times over, including about 31 phone charges, four laptop charges, 15 camera recharges, or around five and a half drone recharges.</p>
<p data-start="2532" data-end="2871">Recharging the power station itself is quick and convenient. Using a standard wall outlet or the USB-C Power Delivery port with an AC adapter, it can reach 80% capacity in just two hours. For those who prefer renewable energy or off-grid use, it’s also compatible with solar charging when paired with panels like the Jackery SolarSaga 100 (sold separately).</p>
<p data-start="2873" data-end="3054">Safety and reliability is important. The Jackery Explorer 300 uses pure sine wave technology, ensuring a stable and clean power supply that protects sensitive electronics.</p>
<p data-start="3056" data-end="3327" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/">At $179 for a limited time, the Jackery Explorer 300 is a pretty sweet deal.</a> Whether for outdoor adventures, emergency preparedness, or everyday convenience, it’s a smart way to start the new year with a purchase you’ll actually use.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass continues to add new games to expand your gaming library, but keeping track of which games are on the service can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with the details on Quarantine Zone: The Last Check’s Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Launching January 12, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts players in control of a crucial checkpoint separating the zombie horde from survivors, tasking you with deciding who gains entry and who is denied, and the choices you make can have serious consequences.</p>



<p>Here’s all the important information on whether Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is on Xbox Game Pass.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-pc-game-pass">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on PC Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Key step. Image via Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Quarantine: The Last Check is available on PC Game Pass through subscription from day one of the launch on January 12, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check was a late addition to the Game Pass service for January, having not been listed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-wave-xbox-game-pass-games-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 games revealed</a> to be coming to the service this month, despite the release window aligning with the announcements.</p>



<p>Instead, the official Xbox social media account teased the <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2009788572078137696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of a new game</a> launching onto PC Game Pass imminently, then later revealed that the game in question is Quarantine: The Last Check, meaning PC players have a new game to enjoy as part of their subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-xbox-game-pass-for-consoles">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on Xbox Game Pass For Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Quarantine: The Last Check will not be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. Instead, only those with PC Game Pass will be able to play.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check launches as a PC exclusive and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-playstation-xbox-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not available on other </a>platforms, such as PlayStation and the Xbox family of consoles. Therefore, you need a PC to play the game.</p>



<p>The good news is that Microsoft’s many tiers of Game Pass subscriptions include a host of PC games, though you will, of course, require a platform to play them on, and, at the time of writing, it has not been confirmed which level of Game Pass is required to access Quarantine: The Last Check on PC.</p>



<p>It’s likely an Ultimate subscription will be required, however, as this is the tier that features day one releases across both platforms, whereas the Premium subscription brings new Xbox-published games to the service within 12 months of launch.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Icarus First Cohort Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Now, RocketWerkz founder Dean Hall has revealed just how many copies of Icarus were sold during the sale. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, Hall shared that that an enormous 984,000 copies were during this sales period. On top of that, the game's DLC, which includes two expansions and a "pets" bundle, moved a further 243,000 units.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Over the steam winter sale, ICARUS sold just under a million new base game units during the sale (984k). We also did quarter of a million DLC units (243k).</p>  — Dean Hall (@rocket2guns) <a href="https://twitter.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>These sales also led to a huge increase in the game's active player base. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1149460/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game enjoyed a massive spike in players during December 2025, with a peak concurrent player count of 44,120 (compared to 9076 in November). This is the highest concurrent player count the game has had since its launch month, December 2021.</p><p>Dean Hall is no stranger to hugely popular online games - he was the developer of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a>, a 2012 zombie survival game that tasked players with surviving in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-filled world where other players were just as dangerous as the undead. The game started life as a mod for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arma-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-38942">Arma 2</a> before eventually receiving a standalone release.</p><p>Steam has already announced dates for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-the-next-steam-sale-date/1100-6532422/" data-ref-id="1100-6532422">next few rounds of sales</a>, through to May 2026. Coming up in January are the Detective Fest from January 12 -19 and the Board Game Fest from January 26 - February 2.</p>

<p>We still don't know exactly what 2026 will hold for Splatoon 3. 2024's 'Grand Festival' brought regular updates and Splatfests to an end, though the game stayed alive and kicking throughout 2025 with continuing seasonal events and the surprise release of a free Switch 2 update.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the game received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">PEGI rating for a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, though Nintendo has yet to confirm anything just yet.</p>

<p>According to modder Tr7zw, getting a version of Vanilla Mocha Doom running in Hytale before it's even out took two or three relatively sleepless nights of work. For that sacrifice, their character can stand in the sky above the landscape and Doom away on a monitor made of blocks. </p><p>As with a lot of the more wacky places to play Doom, I'm not sure it's one I'd pick for an extended shooty run, since its visuals do a bit of a number on your eyes at times. Its creator's endorsement comes with some extra caveats, with them noting: "[It] controls a bit like a broken keyboard, the code doesn't follow best practice at all, but it works enough to play the game somewhat." That said, as weird Doom ports always are, it's undeniably impressive.</p>
<p>This showcase has Doom running on an 80x60 block screen at 20 frames per second, with Tr7zw explaining that the Doom port runs in its own thread, generating a screenshot per frame. "I take the screenshot, downsample it to a size Hytale can handle 20 times per second to place, convert it to blocks with the nearest colour, place them," the modder continued. "And the other way, check for player movement/item interactions to provide input into the engine. Basically the same way logic-wise as you would do it in Minecraft. Just that the code works a lot [differently]."</p>
<p>They're hardly the only modder set loose in Hytale to show its modding potential ahead of early access release. Thus far, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme and co have shown off in-house creations which let you <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010372558198018181">command a skeleton army</a>, be <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/2010098788229361925">followed by a floating lantern</a>, and build a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2009579590713549287">claw-based factory conveyor belt</a>. That's in addition to one of team's devs putting togther a prototype of a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010412549486063673">custom side-scrolling adventure</a> using Hytale's toolset.</p>
<p>With mod site <a href="https://x.com/CurseForge/status/2008177774255636830">CurseForge</a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/"></a> set to support Hytale works from day one and Collins-Laflamme having already announced plans to deliver an <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2008226527436304682">in-game mod browser</a> at some point down the line, it's looking like there'll at least be the means for the game to hit the sorts of modding heights enjoyed by Minecraft over the years. That's assuming mod-makers settle in for the long run and don't run into too many technical hurdles.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-hits-new-record-low-after-two-price-cuts-in-one-week-newest-model-with-built-in-subwoofer-3-1-channel-dolby-atmos-2000658522</link>
            <guid>1403263</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="120afa3f-762d-4d99-b75c-184290b96084" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="488">If you’ve ever splurged on a new TV only to feel underwhelmed once you hit play, the problem probably isn’t the picture—it’s the sound. Modern televisions are thinner than ever, and while that sleek design looks great on the wall, it leaves very little room for quality speakers. As a result, dialogue can sound flat, action scenes lack punch, and music loses its emotional impact. The good news is that dramatically improving your home entertainment audio doesn’t have to cost a fortune.</p>
<p data-start="490" data-end="768"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Right now, Amazon’s Fire TV Soundbar Plus is discounted by 30%, bringing the price down from its usual $250 to just $175.</a> For anyone looking to elevate their viewing experience without diving into an expensive, complicated surround sound setup, this deal is well worth a closer look.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="770" data-end="816">Why a Soundbar Makes Such a Big Difference</h2>
<p data-start="818" data-end="1209">Audio accounts for a huge portion of how we experience movies, sports, and TV shows. Crisp dialogue helps you follow the story, while powerful bass and immersive effects pull you into the action. Relying on your TV’s built-in speakers means missing out on much of what creators intended you to hear. A soundbar is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to fix that problem.</p>
<p data-start="1211" data-end="1493">The Fire TV Soundbar features a 3.1 channel configuration with a built-in subwoofer, delivering noticeably richer and deeper bass than standard TV speakers. Explosions feel more impactful, crowd noise during sports broadcasts sounds more realistic, and music gains warmth and depth.</p>
<p data-start="1495" data-end="1787">It’s worth it alone for the dedicated center channel, which focuses specifically on dialogue. This means voices are clearer and more distinct, even during busy or loud scenes. You can finally stop riding the volume button or turning on subtitles just to understand what characters are saying.</p>
<h2 data-start="1789" data-end="1839">Designed for Small Spaces, Built for Big Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2165">Not everyone has room for a full home theater system, and that’s where this soundbar really shines. Measuring just 37 inches wide, it’s compact enough to fit comfortably in apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or smaller living rooms. You can place it neatly on a TV stand or mount it on the wall for a clean, minimalist setup.</p>
<p data-start="2167" data-end="2522">Despite its modest size, the soundbar delivers an expansive audio experience thanks to DTS Virtual:X technology. This feature creates the illusion of surround sound, making audio feel like it’s coming from all around you—even without rear speakers. Dolby Atmos support further enhances compatible content, adding clarity and dimension to movies and shows.</p>


<h2 data-start="2524" data-end="2563">Easy Setup and Everyday Versatility</h2>
<p data-start="2565" data-end="2784">The Fire TV Soundbar is designed to be plug-and-play. Simply connect it to your TV using HDMI ARC, and your TV should automatically route audio through the soundbar. No complicated menus or technical expertise required.</p>
<p data-start="2786" data-end="3024">Beyond TV viewing, the soundbar also doubles as a wireless speaker. With Bluetooth and USB connectivity, you can stream music, podcasts, or audiobooks directly from your phone or other devices, making it a versatile addition to your home.</p>
<p data-start="3026" data-end="3233">If you already use a Fire TV smart TV or Fire TV streaming device, integration is seamless. You can control both your TV and the soundbar with a single Fire TV remote, keeping things simple and clutter-free.</p>
<p data-start="3273" data-end="3681" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For $175, the Fire TV Soundbar offers a noticeable upgrade over built-in TV speakers, combining clear dialogue, enhanced bass, and immersive sound in a compact, affordable package. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">With its current 30% discount, it’s an ideal opportunity to transform your home viewing experience without overspending</a>. If you’re ready to leave tinny TV audio behind, this soundbar is an easy and budget-friendly step forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The founder of Hypixel Studios has stated that they expect more than one million players during the early access launch. </p>



<p>For those unaware, after being shut down by Riot Games, Hytale was reacquired by Hypixel Studios and is now scheduled to release in early access tomorrow, January 13, 2026. Ahead of this launch, we already knew some details, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank">16 minutes of gameplay</a>, along with plans to add</span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> proximity chat and the potential of multiplayer portals</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-hypixel-founder-asks-players-to-download-launcher-and-login-beforehand-due-to-expected-influx-of-over-1-million-players">Hypixel Founder Asks Players to Download Launcher and Login Beforehand Due to Expected Influx of Over 1 Million Players</h2>



<p>As revealed in a new post on <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the founder of Hypixel Studios has asked players to download the launcher a day prior and log in to help reduce launch-day stress, as they expect “over 1 million players on the early access release day” for Hytale. If you are wondering about the launcher, the developers have confirmed they’ll skip Steam to avoid negative reviews during the early access stage. Interested readers can learn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to download the launcher</a> through Insider Gaming’s guide. </p>

<p>For those unaware, Hytale is a title that blends sandbox creativity with RPG action, where players can “explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block.” As the game is launching in early access, players should expect bugs and other changes, as it is still in active development. However, the developers have polished the core systems for launch, including exploration, responsive combat, and robust building, along with creator‑first tools for creating unique content, minigames, and running community servers. </p>







<p>In other news, Hytale developers have received the blessing to include a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-receives-blessing-to-include-technoblade-tribute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Technoblade tribute</a>. Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC performance and system requirements</a> for the upcoming title.

            <p>Pocketpair has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> Official Card Game, which is, yes, an official card game based on the developer's monster catching survival game, Palworld.</p>
<p>It's coming on 30th July in collaboration with Bushiroad, and has been designed as a two-player competitive card game.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As you would expect, Palworld Official Card Game has been created with many of the core ideas which made Palworld so popular on its debut (remember, this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">chap managed to become only the second game to pass two million concurrent Steam players on its release in 2024</a>). Players will be able to "enjoy strategic and tactical battles" in the upcoming card game, and this will be done by deploying Pals.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.palworld-official-cardgame.com/news/post-1">official website</a>, those who take Palworld Official Card Game for a spin will have to fight alongside the Pal companions while also gathering resources and building up their bases. The Pals, meanwhile, will have "unique traits" which will help lead players to victory.</p><p>"Team up with your trusty Pals and experience the thrill of overcoming formidable enemies through this exciting trading card game," the site reads. At the time of writing, the team hasn't yet released any pricing or specific card details, though on the Palworld Discord server, Pocketpair has said to stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p>You can check out a short teaser for Palworld Official Card Game below.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, Palworld and Pocketpair continue to march along all this time after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-xbox-us-player-numbers-briefly-surpass-fortnite-as-steam-sales-hit-8m-in-six-days">the game's explosive release almost two years ago</a>. Not all headlines have been positive, though, and the developer has been in the midst of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">a legal battle with Nintendo over alleged patent infringement</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, this has actually been leaning in Pocketpair's favour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">with a rejection of Nintendo's patent</a> in October throwing a spanner in the works for Nintendo.</p>

            <p>As we stumble into what increasingly looks like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-its-gaming-hardware-contingent-ces-2026-was-a-good-week-to-bury-good-news">hardware-unfriendly</a> 2026, RAMnarök shows no signs of petering out. As tech giants continue hoarding memory chips to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genai-users-larian-forced-to-build-divinity-around-ram-shortage-caused-by-genai">build their AI farms</a>, and suppliers gleefully <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/110871-samsung-sk-hynix-jacking-up-dram-prices-much.html">jack up their prices</a> in turn, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">consumer-grade RAM is still laughably expensive</a> – and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSDs</a>, most of which also need these in-demand chips, are seeing some nasty inflation as well.</p>
<p>I bring this up now, when storage prices began climbing back in November, because the past week has been <em>particularly</em> fucked, vis-à-vis the kind of SSDs you’d want in a modern games PC. <a href="https://keepa.com/#!">Keepa</a>, Amazon-tracking the browser extension I’ve long used to gauge the honesty of Prime Day and Black Friday deals, makes for grim reading: the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B7CKVCCV/?th=1">1TB WD Black SN850X</a> currently sits at £162, having been £116 on January 5th, and £85 on November 5th. Nearly double the price, in barely two months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CK2TC9XQ/">Crucial T500</a>, another "recommendable in other circumstances" PCIe 4.0 drive, offered its 2TB version for £140 across most of November. Now it’s £240, having climbed even further from the £193 it cost earlier in January. The closest thing to an upside here is that the T500 will shortly be put out of its misery, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">entire Crucial brand being sacrificed</a> to help expand the AI bubble that made its storage and RAM so unaffordable in the first place.</p>
<p>And it’s not just NVMe SSDs, as the ol' SATA-based <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08PC5DKZQ/">Samsung 870 Evo 1TB</a> has climbed from £83 in November, to £110 in December, to £140 right now. You know something’s gone wrong when you can’t even turn to outmoded tech like SATA drives to avoid the bite. DRAMless SSDs aren’t reliable alternatives either, despite their defining omission – a DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) cache, built using the very memory chips that are in such short supply – logically making them more resistant to supply issues. Yet the DRAMless <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CP42QVT8">Samsung 990 Evo</a>, in its 2TB capacity, is going for £233, almost a hundred quid more than its December price of £144.</p><p>Again, there’s no indication that prices will self-right any time soon; even if the supply of DRAM chips increases, they’re more likely to end up in another Big Tech warehouse than in your home desktop. Not counting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD cards</a> for handhelds, that only leaves – urgh – mechanical hard drives as the economically sensible choice for upgrading your PC’s storage. And, as anyone who’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-the-love-of-all-things-good-do-not-install-starfield-on-a-hard-drive">tried to run Starfield on one</a> will tell you, they’re not much of an upgrade at all.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-macbook-air-2025-13-inch-m4-hits-its-lowest-price-ever-in-a-new-year-laptop-clearance-2000658785</link>
            <guid>1403242</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You gotta love it when an elite-level laptop processor takes a serious price dive because a new version hits the market. That’s what’s happened with Apple’s M4-powered laptops since the M5 chip dropped last October, and while the M5 models are truly incredible, the M4s still pack a powerful punch, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/">you can score a 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air for just $799 at Amazon right now</a>.</p>
<p>Apple’s most recent features and innovations are all packed into the M4 MacBook Air, from Apple Intelligence AI, an 18-hour battery life, and some of the absolute best visuals and sound of any laptop. The M4 MacBooks are a great opportunity for creative pros, Apple fans, and anyone wanting to score a truly great laptop that’s marked down by hundreds of dollars from its original price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Still Fresh</h2>
<p>Apple’s rapid upgrade schedule from the M2 chip to the M5 — a trek that took only two years — means that the “previous model” MacBooks are actually very,&nbsp;<em>very</em> recent. This 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is less than a year old, which means you won’t have to worry about OS compatibility or falling behind on the latest Apple goodies for years to come, most likely. Since the jump from the M4 to the M5 is a 20% gain in CPU speed and quicker Apple Intelligence, you might not notice the performance difference at all, but you’ll definitely notice the $200 that’s staying in your wallet when you go with the M4 MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice when you fire up the M4 MacBook Air is, of course, Apple’s legendary Liquid Retina display. A billion colors are packed into the 13.6-inch screen to make any picture or static image truly pop, and with a great refresh rate, your videos and streaming will be absolutely peak. The MacBook Air’s 12MP Center Stage camera combines with three built-in mics and four speakers with Spatial Audio to create a perfect multimedia machine for video calls.</p>



<h2>All-Day Intelligence</h2>
<p>Once you dig into the latest iteration of Apple Intelligence, you’ll want to play with it all day. Apple’s AI model is a true boon to anyone needing a hand with writing, creating, research, or anything else you ask of it. Apple’s built market-best privacy protection features into Apple Intelligence, making your searches and activity so secure that even Apple can’t see them. You can indulge in that all-day dive into Apple Intelligence with the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air, because it comes with a robust 18-hour battery life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/">The 20%-off Amazon deal that cuts the price of the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air by a full $200</a>, down to just $799, is especially noteworthy since Apple’s been historically a little spare with their sale prices. But it’s real, and it’s still live right now for anyone looking to score a top-of-the-line MacBook at a terrific price.</p>

<p>It seems Ubisoft could be gearing up for an announcement of The Division: Definitive Edition, as a banner has surfaced in Japan. </p>



<p>The Division franchise seems to be progressing well, with Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty stating that The Division 3 is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaping up to be a monster</a>” and thinks it could have as significant an impact as the first game in the series. Talking about the first game, it seems there still might be something in store for us for Division 1 in 2026. </p>











<p><span>Spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/domen0204" target="_blank">domen0204</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter), a banner for The Division: Definitive Edition was spotted at the FPS Day X event in Japan recently, with many hoping that the developers will finally provide an official announcement during its 10th Anniversary celebrations.</span> Additionally, we received some new announcements for The Division 2, with the developers confirming a ‘Realism mode’ coming in March 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-division-2-s-realism-mode">The Division 2’s Realism Mode</h2>



<p>The Division 2’s ‘Realism mode’ will feature action-focused gameplay, reduced time-to-kill, and realistic weapon damage based on bullet caliber, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game in a brand-new way. Additionally, the mode will also introduce reduced UI, limited HUD, no health regeneration, reduced cool-down, and more. The devs also confirmed this is only the “first glimpses of the celebrations ahead,” with “more surprises” to come. </p>

Additionally, The Division 2 was ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saved’ by a team of five developers.</a> What are your thoughts on The Division: Definitive Edition’s banner surfacing online?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon Trading Card Game</u></a> had a defining year in 2025, with not only the return of Mega Evolutions, the bold visual direction of Black and White Rares, and jaw-dropping Special Illustration Rares from Prismatic Evolutions and Phantasmal Flames pushing artistic ambition to new heights. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Altogether, the market for singles in the Pokémon TCG has been skyrocketing, with the game’s continued short supply escalating the values of stunning chase cards even further</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Altogether, there have been ten cards that have stood above the rest. The ten most valuable cards brought by the Pokémon TCG are not only more expensive due to their amazing potential for competitive play, but also because of rare and exclusive artwork that makes them worthy of a museum, rather than a deck box. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using prices determined by the dedicated TCG marketplace <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZAenv?object_uuid=c694fa85-b62f-4489-8a8a-73285ed6f490&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>, ranked below from cheapest to most expensive, these ten cards represent the pinnacle of what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/pokemon"><u>Pokémon</u></a> card collectors and players were chasing throughout 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mega Gardevoir ex – 187/132 (ME01: Mega Evolution)</h2><div catalogid="144124ae-cbf5-456f-8b82-b94a616ad49b" id="234322"><div id="234322" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex – 187/132 (ME01: Mega Evolution)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although only the tenth most valuable Pokémon card released in 2025, the golden Mega Hyper Rare of Mega Gardevoir has artwork that presents Ralt’s final evolution in an elegant, almost celestial pose, reinforcing its identity as a Pokémon of grace rather than brute force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the table, however, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8xkJ?object_uuid=c694fa85-b62f-4489-8a8a-73285ed6f490&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Gardevoir ex</u></a> is anything but gentle. Overflowing Wishes accelerates Psychic Energy across your bench, setting up devastating turns where Mega Symphonia scales damage based on total attached Energy. In slower, resource-heavy metas, Gardevoir decks flourished, making this card both well-sought after for its design and respected on a strategic level.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Mega Lucario ex – 188/132 (ME01: Mega Evolution)</h2></div><div catalogid="144124ae-cbf5-456f-8b82-b94a616ad49b" id="234323"><div id="234323" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex – 188/132 (ME01: Mega Evolution)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Lucario ex’s gold Mega Hyper Rare treatment instantly upped its value with some added prestige. With an almost ceremonial design that belongs in a chapel window, Lucario is framed as a focal icon, with metallic finishes that catch the light far more dramatically than standard illustration cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Competitively, all versions of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q45BLA?object_uuid=c694fa85-b62f-4489-8a8a-73285ed6f490&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Lucario ex</u></a> earn their place in decks through sheer efficiency. Aura Jab accelerates Fighting Energy across the board, enabling rapid board development, while Mega Brave offers an explosive 270-damage swing capable of ending games outright. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the attack’s drawback limits consecutive use, Lucario’s consistency kept it relevant in Fighting-based archetypes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Sylveon ex – 156/131 (SV: Prismatic Evolutions)</h2></div><div catalogid="144124ae-cbf5-456f-8b82-b94a616ad49b" id="234324"><div id="234324" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sylveon ex – 156/131 (SV: Prismatic Evolutions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sylveon ex sits at number eight with its pastel-heavy Special Illustration Rare artwork that’s immediately striking, leaning fully into the Eeveelution’s fairy-like charm with crystalline motifs and soft colours that bring a nice brighter contrast with the darker chase cards of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In gameplay terms, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjKqM?object_uuid=c694fa85-b62f-4489-8a8a-73285ed6f490&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Sylveon ex</u></a> carved out a niche as a control-leaning option. Magical Charm dampens opposing damage output, while Angelite provides rare bench disruption by shuffling opposing Pokémon back into the deck. In a 2025 meta increasingly defined by set-up reliant strategies, that kind of interference could carry some real value. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mega Charizard X ex – 130/094 (ME02: Phantasmal Flames)</h2></div><div catalogid="144124ae-cbf5-456f-8b82-b94a616ad49b" id="234328"><div id="234328" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex – 130/094 (ME02: Phantasmal Flames)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The golden ticket equivalent of the Phantasmal Flames expansion, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7RwdP?object_uuid=c694fa85-b62f-4489-8a8a-73285ed6f490&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Hyper Rare version of Charizard X ex</u></a> is a pure spectacle that never gets old when staring at it in your binder. The gold silhouette treatment transforms Charizard into a mythic emblem rather than one of the best Pocket Monsters, but with even more mystique than Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir’s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the minimalist look, the card’s competitiveness is a joy to play with, too. Inferno X allows players to convert excess Fire Energy into overwhelming damage, making Mega Charizard X ex one of the most feared closers of the year. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Reshiram ex – 173/086 (SV: White Flare)</h2></div><div catalogid="144124ae-cbf5-456f-8b82-b94a616ad49b" id="234325"><div id="234325" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Reshiram ex – 173/086 (SV: White Flare)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Reshiram ex’s Black White Rare treatment strips colour almost entirely, rendering the Legendary Pokémon in stark monochrome light that makes it look like a beautiful marble slab; it’s without a doubt one of the most unique prints we’ve seen recently in the TCG — all the more reason it’s a top contender among the most expensive Pokemon cards last year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Functionally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7RyJn?object_uuid=c694fa85-b62f-4489-8a8a-73285ed6f490&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Reshiram ex</u></a> thrives as a comeback threat. Blaze Burst scales damage with the opponent’s Prize count, punishing aggressive decks that take early leads. Fire decks in 2025 often leaned on this mechanic to flip matches late, and combined with the card’s minimalist aesthetic, made Reshiram ex a standout collector piece.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Zekrom ex – 172/086 (SV: Black Bolt)</h2></div><div catalogid="144124ae-cbf5-456f-8b82-b94a616ad49b" id="234326"><div id="234326" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex – 172/086 (SV: Black Bolt)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Reshiram’s lead, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QK8x1y?object_uuid=c694fa85-b62f-4489-8a8a-73285ed6f490&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Zekrom ex’s</u></a> own Black White Rare follows the same style design, but is stunning in its own way: using the Black White Rare format to emphasise raw power and silhouette. In fact, the sculpted look almost gives the Gen-5 Legendary a statue-like depiction, giving the card itself a sense of weight rarely seen in modern artwork in the TCG lately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In gameplay, Voltage Burst rewards aggressive opponents by scaling damage as Prize cards are taken.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>With the first expedition window for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> concluded in December, Embark Studios has revealed that just over a million players opted in to reset their characters in exchange for various rewards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Having sold over 12m copies according to analyst estimates</a>, that's under 10 percent of all players.</p>
<p>Expeditions, for those unaware, allow players to send off their levelled up character (alongside all the goodies stored in their stash) off on a grand adventure. In return your account gets cosmetics, an XP boost on your next character, expanded stash space, and for those able to gather up to five million credits additional skill points above the cap on their next character. A powerful boon!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics">In an interview with PCGamesN</a>, design director Virgil Watkins stated that of that roughly one million players, around 35-40 percent of them managed to scrape together the five million credits required for the full spread of skill point boosts during the expedition window.</p>

</figure>
<p>Watkins also shared learnings from the game's first expedition window, stating: "One of the bigger topics [of feedback] was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points, and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on.</p><p>"So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, [we set] that as an aspirational goal that some players might achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, 'Well, now I have to do that to get it.'"</p>
<p>With just over a month until the next expedition window, it looks like the next opportunity for a reset will work largely in the same fashion as this initial run, though as PCGamesN points out changes to the final rush for credits can absolutely change. Watkins said that the team is looking at ways to "bring a little more variety" to the system, poring over player data.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders, unlike many other extraction games, have an opt-in reset mechanic rather than a forced progression wipe. As such, those not especially concerned with extra stash space or a few extra skill points don't <em>have</em> to worry about it too much. Given how hard it can be to build up a hoard of loot, one wanders if casual Arc Raiders players will be inclined to cash it all in for such bonuses.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders itself appears to be maintaining momentum going into 2026, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">with Hollywood seemingly keen to chat about a theatrical adaptation of some sort</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-arc-raiders-cheaper-than-most-triple-a-games-thanks-to-helldivers-2-mostly">its cheaper price point</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">some well-timed holiday discounts</a>, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

<p>Final stream was a speedrun of Pokémon Emerald</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The <strong>Awesome Games Done Quick 2026</strong> event has now closed with a total of <strong>$2.443.554</strong> raised for the <a href="https://preventcancer.org/">Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The week-long fundraiser ended with a speedrun for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Pokémon Emerald</a> by streamer adef, who managed to beat it in 3 hours and 13 minutes. Other highlights from the event include a 70-Star, 70-Player relay for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> and an any% speedrun for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> from streamer Ceen, who stormed through the game to beat the final boss in 54 minutes and 55 seconds.</p>
<p>The next major event, Summer Games Done Quick 2026, will take place later this year from <strong>5th - 11th July</strong>, with donations going to <a href="https://www.msf.org/">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> (Doctors Without Borders).</p>
<p>The charity events have not been without controversy, with the 2022 Summer Games Done Quick fundraiser seeing the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/sgdq-fake">complete ban of speedrunner Mekarazium</a> for faking a run of the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/metal_gear_rising_revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a> DLC. The player had shown a segmented, pre-recorded video of the run rather than playing it live, later admitting to this and receiving a ban from future GDQ events.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a> almost had a 'character creator' system that would have seen you choosing an ancestor from a database of millions of people, rather than being thrust into the riding boots of Scarlet Pimple-esque nobleman Arno Dorian. The idea was broadly to give each player a unique perspective on the complexities of the French Revolution. According to former creative director Alexandre Amancio, this character creation system dates back to a time when the developers were weighing up two versions of the game, one of them far more co-op focussed. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, they rolled with a more familiar flavour of Assassin's Creed, but Amancio - who was also creative director for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-revelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a> - still wishes they'd committed to the riskier option for Unity. Our original reviewer Alec Meer might have agreed. Back in 2014, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-unity-review-pc">criticised</a> the game for "reverting to type despite its glitzy surface", and knocked the four-player co-op specifically for simply duplicating Arno: "it is simply boring for everyone to be the same (not particularly interesting) character".
</p>
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-assassins-creed-director-alexandre-amancio-explains-how-to-fix-aaa-development">a recent interview</a> with the chino-wearing, pipe-smoking sophisticates of GamesIndustry.biz. "When we began making Unity, two games started emerging," Amancio told the site's features editor Lewis Packwood following a talk at DevGAMM Lisbon... last November??? Fine, I guess we'll file this under 'news to me'. 
</p>
<p>
"One game was a traditional Assassin's Creed game, with the main protagonist carving his path through the French Revolution, but we also wanted to make a co-op game," Amancio went on. "We found a clever way of hiding a character creation system within Assassin's Creed. Instead of having just one blood ancestor in the Animus, it's a database of millions of people, and you're searching for an ancestor. So the more you describe that ancestor, the more it reduces the search until you find a match.
</p><p>
"The French Revolution is such a complex mishmash of different events and different perspectives that it would have been a more accurate portrayal if, instead of having a linear adventure through the lens of one character, you got your own perspective of the revolution," he continued. "So everyone's experience through the game is their own path through a complex event.
</p>
<p>
"At one point, we needed to choose to make one game or the other. Obviously these are huge investments with huge teams, so we made the decision to make the title that people would most recognize. But somewhere inside of me, I still wish we would've gone for that other one."
</p>
<p>
To play both sides, I can well imagine the hypothetical database-searching feature panning out badly, though it's hard to comment at length based on these crumbs of insight. Creating a repository of millions of potentially playable NPCs so that the player can refine the selection down to one protagonist sounds like a massive expense, needless to say, requiring steep compromises or supernatural forbearance from management on par with that shown to, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a>.</p>
<p>It also would have required a different approach to narrative - something closer to an MMO or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, with its selection of protagonist backstories. Hence the "hidden" character creation system being one component of a wholly different Unity concept. As Amancio notes, Unity was the first Assassin's Creed to allow co-op multiplayer within the open world, so even the more conventional version they shipped was a bit of a gamble, despite the well-worn mechanics and framing.
</p><p>
Still, character creation as population database refinement is a cool idea in general, not least because it suggests a period portrayal in which your assassin could be a heroic latrine digger, rather than some lukewarm blueblood adventurer. It makes me think of the collective storytelling of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/velvet-89-is-a-free-hidden-object-game-that-tells-the-story-of-the-czechoslovakian-revolution">Velvet 89</a>.
</p>
<p>
Amancio attributes a little of the Unity database idea's inception to his time working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, a series he feels has more appetite for unscripted upheaval. "I started my career at Ubisoft on Far Cry, not on Assassin's Creed, and I'm a huge fan of systemic games. I like simple, small systems that interact to create emergence. And Assassin's Creed was always open world, but very much a directed game. I've always had this desire to inject a little bit more of that chaos into the game.
</p>
<p>
"For example, adding the bomb system to Revelations was a way of exposing systems to the audience, because you could attract and disperse the crowd. It was a way of giving tools to players. These are the kinds of decisions that I think would have made - and still could make - Assassin's Creed into a more, in my opinion, modern game."
</p>
<p>
It's strange to compare Unity, let alone Revelations to the more recent Creed outings, post Assassin's Creed Odyssey. The series is now far more of an open world RPG and an exercise in pillaging the past. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">summarised</a> the most recent Assassin's Creed Shadows as "a marathon of distraction" and "a reliably Ubisoftian tourist trap that sequesters you in a hedge maze of history with a packed itinerary and a disregard for the time constraints of adult life". I'd like to hear more from Amancio about how they could shake things up. Then again, given that Unity and Revelations are among the less-good Creeds, it's perhaps better that he's no longer part of the picture.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> early access release week, with the recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">resurrected via purchase from Riot</a> blocky sandbox set to ruck up tomorrow, January 13th. Ahead of the big day the Hypixel co-founder who's currently spearheading the game has asked prospective players to download and log into its launcher nice and early, with the hopes this can help keep launch day disruption to a minimum.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said co-founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme, outlined in a tweet over the weekend that the Hytale team are anticipating having a stampede of "over 1 million players" to descend on the game over the course of launch day.  As outlined in our handy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">Hytale release times guide</a>, the game'll be emerging from its square cave in the middle of the afternoon UK and European time, with US folks seeing it launch in the morning their time. </p>
<p>Ahead of that, Collins-Laflamme has a couple of steps he's urged prospective players to take. "Please <a href="https://hytale.com/download">download the launcher</a> today and log in now to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress," he wrote. "Let us know if you are having any issues."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>IMPORTANT</p><p>We expect over 1 million players on the early access release day for Hytale (January 13). Please download the launcher today and log in now to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress. Let us know if you are having any issues.</p><p>Download now:… <a href="https://t.co/kiMYIkKmJI">pic.twitter.com/kiMYIkKmJI</a></p></div>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Provided plenty of folks take those steps, here's hoping Hytale's launch'll avoid serious issues or hugely lengthy queues, though such things are obviously never totally inevitable possibilities when any game goes live. In this case, the fact Hytale's launcher'll be the sole way to access it early doors - with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-on-steam-right-away-as-its-devs-want-to-avoid-overindexing-on-negative-reviews-from-players-who-arent-as-well-informed-yet">no versions on Steam</a> or other storefronts at this point - is likely part of what's got the devs concerned about getting everyone in quickly.</p><p>Once you've done the reccomended admin, maybe take a second to make sure you're all caught up on the myriad of things the devs of the rapidly resurrected sandbox have said about what you can expect it to offer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">right out of the box</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-devs-hope-to-redefine-the-block-game-genre-with-their-world-generation-and-theyve-now-explained-how-it-works">further down the line</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worth being aware that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-launch-with-native-linux-support-though-the-steam-deck-is-not-officially-recommended">native Linux support</a> will be available for Hytale right from the get go, but it isn't guarunteed to work seamlessly on the Steam Deck right away.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade developers seem to be living the life we all want, as they have been given over $3,000 in cash and Apple products as a New Year’s Bonus. </p>



<p>Shift Up knows how to treat its employees and keep them motivated through frequent bonuses awarded on major milestones and other occasions. For last year’s New Year’s Eve, the developers were given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-employees-receive-ps5-pros-and-a-cash-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 Pros</a> and a cash bonus. This time, Shift Up has returned with another set of goodies for the employees. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-devs-were-gifted-cash-and-apple-products-for-new-year-s">Stellar Blade Devs Were Gifted Cash and Apple Products for New Year’s </h2>



<p>According to a report by South Korean outlet <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2K773GI6BZ">Seoul Economic Daily</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-up-has-gifted-all-its-staff-3500-airpods-max-and-an-apple-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Shift Up has gifted 300 employees a 5 million won cash bonus ($3400 USD), Apple AirPods Max, and Apple Watches for this New Year’s. As mentioned above, Shift Up is known to shower their employees with gifts; they have previously received items such as iPhone 14s, credit cards loaded with 10 million won ($6,800 USD), PlayStation 5 Pros, and Switch 2s. Don’t you wish you were working at Shift Up as well? </p>



<p>Currently, the dev team is working on the Stellar Blade sequel and other projects, and this could be the best way to motivate them and keep their interests aligned. The dev team is also working on a cross-platform title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-upcoming-title-will-be-published-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Spirits</a>, which will be created through “a strategic partnership to include both publishing and joint development,” with Tencent’s Level Infinite. </p>







<p>In other news, Stellar Blade devs are considering additional platform expansions, which could mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-could-come-to-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 and Xbox ports</a> are on the way. Additionally, Shift Up is planning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multi-platform release</a> for the sequel.

<p>The countdown until the release of Hytale is rapidly approaching the end, and as players across the world gear up for the release of the title, questions have naturally emerged about the Hytale release time.</p>



<p>Hytale releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 13</a> as a PC exclusive, though it is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-steam-how-to-buy-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">not available on Steam</a> at launch, after a rollercoaster ride through development that saw the title cancelled by Riot Games last year, before then being re-acquired by the original creators.</p>



<p>There’s still a long development journey ahead until a full 1.0 release, but players will finally be able to sink their teeth into Hytale imminently, and Insider Gaming has the release time details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-time-does-hytale-release">What Time Does Hytale Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go time. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale has a confirmed release time of 10 AM ET/3 PM GMT on PC, as revealed by a countdown timer on the official Hytale website.</strong></p>



<p>The official countdown on the <a href="https://hytale.com/countdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale website</a> has been running for a while, counting down exactly how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds are left before players can dive into the game.</p>



<p>Hytale devs are expecting around one million players on launch day, so there could be some server issues to iron out early on, but the hope is that when the doors open, players will be able to flock in.</p>



<p>If you are having issues launching the game when the release time has passed, you may have to wait and try again, and make sure to keep an eye on the official Hytale social media accounts for any news and updates on ongoing problems.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact release time for Hytale in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Hytale Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Jan. 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
