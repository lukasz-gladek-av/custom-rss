<p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/2000929148324217105">Koei Tecmo</a> and <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/2000929148324217105">Nintendo</a> have announced that version 1.0.3 will drop on 18th December 2025, version 1.0.3 is adding new features, more Battle and Hyrule Challenges in the post-game, and a brand new difficulty mode (Thanks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ma4cogcglm2w">OatmealDome</a>!).</p>
<p>Let's dig into Phantom Mode, first — this is an event that randomly occurs in fights you've already cleared. Some foes will turn into either a more powerful version of itself or a "Miasma" variant. Oh, and Phantom Ganon can appear out of nowhere. Just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>! The new difficulty mode, called "Taboo" (at least via Google Translate), is even harder than Very Hard.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2lumskt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>A few functionality and bug fixes are being patched in too, but for a deeper rundown of the specifics, we'll have the full English patch notes later this week. For now, here are the major new additions (via Koei Tecmo, Google Translate):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Phantom Mode</strong><br>
"Phantom Mode" is a new feature that randomly occurs in battles that have already been cleared.</p>
<p>In battles where "Phantom Mode" occurs, some of the enemies that appear will change into "Dangerous Species" or "Miasma Enemies," and there is a chance that "Phantom Ganon" will appear when a strong enemy is defeated. Compared to normal battles, you can obtain more "High-Purity Zonanium Steel."<br>
<strong><br>
Difficulty level "Taboo"</strong><br>
In the new difficulty level "Taboo," you can experience high-difficulty battles that are even more tense than "Very Hard."</p>
<p>By clearing a certain number of battles in "Taboo," you will receive special rewards such as "High-Purity Zonanium Steel" and "Increased Carry Limit for Special Food."<br>
<strong><br>
Adding new challenges</strong><br>
Following the first free update, the second update will also add multiple <strong>"Battle Challenges"</strong> and <strong>"Hyrule Challenges"<br></strong><br>
to the Hyrule map after clearing the main story. Lizalfos and Chuchu will appear as new "dangerous species." Additionally, the "Training Hall" on Sky Island will be unlocked, allowing players to activate Sync Strikes by entering the "Training Hall" with two other players.<br>
<strong><br>
New unique skills added</strong><br>
New unique skills will be added to the Mysterious Golem for the One-Handed Sword, Two-Handed Sword, and Spear.</p>
<p>The One-Handed Sword's unique skill, "Shield Charge," allows you to step forward with your shield ready to ward off dangerous attacks from charging enemies. Additionally, by timing this skill with an enemy attack, you can unleash a powerful spinning slash.<br>
(You can learn it by completing the "Battle Challenge" and "Hyrule Challenge" that will be added in this update.)<br>
<strong><br>
New weapons added</strong><br>
The Forbidden Sword, a one-handed sword whose blade has been tainted by miasma and transformed into a sinister blade, has been added. It can be equipped by Mysterious Golems and warriors of all races.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the following new battles will be added:<br>
- "Battles focused on warriors"<br>
- "A deadly battle with a certain formidable enemy"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you haven't been back to Age of Imprisonment since launch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-update-1-0-2-patch-notes-new-quests-weapons-and-battles-added">the last update</a> brought with it new challenges, weapons, and sync strikes, so you'll have plenty more to do with 1.0.2 <em>and</em> 1.0.3.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Let us know whether you'll be diving into Taboo Mode in the comments.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-10-year-anniversary-celebration-interview-joshua-mills-alex-karpazis-ubisoft-montreal/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>"<em>You're game only turns 10 once</em>," said creative director Alex Karpazis as a means of an apology before showing other members of the press and me a previously released video he assumed we had already seen, celebrating Ubisoft's Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege reaching over 100 million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege-review/">across the 10 years it has been on shelves</a>.</p>



<p>He has no need to apologize, of course. Anyone who was a part of building a game like Rainbow Six Siege would want to show it off and its accomplishments as much as possible. It's a game that, despite how you might feel about it now, has stood the test of time. It went from being a major miss at launch to becoming one of the mainstay multiplayer games in the industry, even after games like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone arrived two and five years after it (respectively) to take over the multiplayer shooter space in a way that no one has dominated since.</p>



<p>Karpazis was showing us the anniversary video below while, just outside the cornered off room we were in, Ubisoft Montreal staff, their families, fans of the game, and content creators were sharing a large space on the bottom floor of the Montreal studio, partying and celebrating all of that, and the journey Rainbow Six Siege went on in the last 10 years to get to this anniversary.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>I wasn't just there to attend a party and to watch an old video with the game's creative leads. Members of the press and I were given a tour of the Ubisoft Montreal studio, which lives in an old textile factory building that was converted into an office building, and eventually, entirely overtaken by Ubisoft after they occupied just the fifth floor when they first moved in.</p>



<p>I also got to speak with Alexander Karpazis and Joshua Mills, Rainbow Six's game director, all about the 10 years leading to this milestone, how the landscape of live service games and multiplayer first-person shooters has changed in the last decade, and I also got the chance to prod at a personal question I have for Ubisoft overall, which is trying to figure out why Assassin's Creed Valhalla is such an unbelievably long game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-1-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The face of Ubisoft Montreal was all Rainbow Six Siege-focused for the anniversary.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before I get into all of that, I want to dig into the tour of the studio during the day and the evening's festivities first. Starting with the tour, which couldn't help but feel like a school trip to the science centre. Not that I'm finding fault in that. That's just how these things seem to go, or at least that's been my experience of Ubisoft studio tours since this was my third one within two years.</p>



<p>At my previous outlet, I had the opportunity to visit Ubisoft Toronto ahead of Star Wars Outlaws' launch, and just prior to joining Wccftech, I got to visit Ubisoft Quebec ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows' release. Both of those tours had a layer of that 'school trip' feeling, but each stop on the way through the building had a direct connection to the game and that team's role in its development.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You can't see him, but radio host Ryan O'Donnell is sitting in the middle of all these lights and cameras. This is what the lights look like at 5% power.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, it is always undeniably cool to see the spaces and the technology that a massive triple-A company like Ubisoft puts behind its games, and it was especially cool to see two volunteers from our group get scanned the same way Ubisoft would any of its actors or physical objects it wants to bring into the game in detailed ways.</p>



<p>The foley room was also a personal highlight, but the letdown of it all was not getting to see very much about what's coming next for Rainbow Six Siege. We did get an early look at Wildcards after the tour, but overall, the tour itself just felt disconnected from the game that brought me and everyone else on the tour to Montreal.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>After the tour, and before my conversation with Alex Karpazis and Joshua Mills, we hung around the celebration event, where there were displays of key moments from Rainbow Six Siege's history, including a wall documenting the 10-year journey since the game's launch and its internal pre-launch beginnings.</p>



<p>There were also replicas of recognizable weapons, gadgets, and armour from Rainbow Six Siege, though perhaps the most significant display was that of messages from players that Ubisoft received over the last 10 years. Not the kinds of comments and messages you'd see on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or Reddit, but messages like a letter from a couple that met while playing Rainbow Six Siege, who were married this year on October 4, 2025, and who likely would not have found each other if not for Siege.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>A wall of portraits of Operators from Rainbow Six Siege.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Or a letter from Connor, a Siege player from the US who had to deal with major health issues in recent years and was helped through his struggles by playing Siege, a game he's played since 2016. These letters, the families of the developers attending the event, and the wall of Siege's journey were some of the most tangible displays of how much impact Rainbow Six Siege has had in 10 years.</p>



<p>It's always good to be reminded of how games touch the lives of millions of people in ways you can't know, because the well is so vast and we have so many games at our fingertips. In that framing, the fact that Rainbow Six Siege has been around for 10 years is all the more impressive and impactful, especially when you remember that hundreds of games, even those made by Ubisoft, don't have that kind of longevity. This is all to say that, for a moment, it didn't feel like a cookie-cutter corporate party. </p>

<p>With that settled, here's my conversation with Rainbow Six Siege's creative director Alex Karpazis and game director Joshua Mills.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Could you please start by saying who you are, your role within Rainbow Six Siege, how long you've been with the game and how long you've been with Ubisoft?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong> <strong>Karpazis:</strong> <em>The name is Alex Karpazis, creative director on Rainbow Six Siege. I've been a part of the team for over seven years now and I've been with Ubisoft for over 14 years.</em></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>My name is Joshua Mills, [I'm] the game director on Siege. I've been with Siege for a little over four years now, but I've been at Ubisoft for over 10 years</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Rainbow Six Siege has been around for 10 years now, and for a number of those years, it was <em>the</em> example to other studios of how it is possible to turn around a multiplayer FPS game that doesn't hit its mark at launch.</strong> <strong>Looking at the landscape of shooters now, where do you feel Rainbow Six sits in the heiarchy of live service and first-person shooters?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>Well, first, I'm still incredibly proud of where we stand, for Rainbow. Like the fact is we're going strong, 10 years in. We just crossed a hundred million</em> <em>players active in the game and being part of this</em> <em>community, which is amazing. As far as, like, [the] competition of it all, we've always kind of done our own thing as far as how we move this game forward and then where we focus, and I don't think we're going to be changing that.</em></p>



<p><em>We just want to continue to serve our community as much as possible and exactly what they want, because at the end of the day, Rainbow is a really, really unique experience, and we're going to continue to build and serve that. And because of it being such a unique experience, it's one of a kind, in a lot of ways. Once you play Rainbow and you really get into it, it's very hard to find that anywhere else, and I'm super proud of the team and where we are on this, and we'll just keep investing on it.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-event-Photos-6-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>An entire wall dedicated to telling the story of Rainbow Six Siege.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>I would say, not only just to double down on that, but we're always trying to answer the needs of our players first, and not to whatever some competition is doing. It's one of the reasons why we chose to continue invest in the game rather than do something like a sequel. So, hopefully, that sets the precedence that others can look and say, 'hey, this can work,' because for us, we're always going to want to reward and respect the time that our community puts into a game.</em></p>



<p><strong>You've clearly carved out a community of players that play Siege, they love to play Siege, and they'll keep playing Siege. So how do you focus, with the next 10 years in mind, how do you direct for those players and then also for chances to grow the game, because you know you can't stay stagnant; growth is required. So how do you balance both?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>I think one of the key things there is the depth of Siege. We haven't reached the bottom of that barrel, like, as far as what we do next, the game is constantly kind of showcasing where we should be going next, just by the nature of it being a systemic beast of a game, which is fantastic and it helps us continue to reinforce that core, which is reinforcing that core audience.</em></p>



<p><em>Beyond that, how can we kind of open the doors for more players to get involved and grow? It really influenced impacting on our onboarding experience, because Siege has an intimidation factor around it. It is a tough game, but it is incredibly rewarding once you really get into it and you understand the mechanics and understand, say, some of the maps and stuff. So our investment into onboarding is a pretty big focus. We literally, just with Season 4 launching this week, the Clear House mode was introduced. Which is kind of a reinvention of T-Hunt, almost, which is an awesome way for players to be able to start learning maps, learning weapons, and also it came with a mini map, which we didn't have anything like this.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-7-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>We'll see if Ubisoft is able to stay true to this goal.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>In fact, I think, what was</em> <em>it, Year Seven, when we got our first tutorial kind of thing? So that's the kind of focus we need to have for new players coming in. Because, we've said this before, we recognize [that] we may not be your first FPS, but we're going to be you're last FPS. That's our kind of target on it because there is a step that's required to get into Rainbow, but if you're willing to make that step, we're going to do everything in our power to help guide you along the way. The road to mastery is ridiculously long and up until this point, it's been a gravel road with a lot of hills and we're paving it a little bit, but it's still going to be just as long.</em></p>



<p><em>So you have this time to invest and you have this time to gain that mastery, and we're going to do our best to make it a little smoother for you.</em></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>I would say too, when</em> <em>you're talking about growth. First, the players who jump into Siege and love Siege, supporting us all this time,</em> <em>it's incredible. But this has now become a generational game. So, [if] you were 20 years old, and now you're 30, going into the game, it's about ushering in that new generation of people who haven't discovered it yet.</em> <em>So, for us, that's great,</em> <em>because we're now building this</em> <em>community and the next generation is just being added to it, added to it, added to it. So we can see that in our player base, just how they're evolving and how they're growing. Like, that's hugely satisfying to see that kind of impact</em> <em>too.</em> </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-8-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>One of the rooms in Ubisoft Montreal's foley studio.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The landscape of live service games has changed so much; there are all these new challenges for developers, and all these new flavours of live service games. Where do you pull inspiration from now? How has that changed over the years, and how do you find ways to still be creative?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>I think one of the key things, when we're talking about inspiration and making sure we're going true to the path that Rainbow needs to follow, is to</em> <em>look at the legacy of Rainbow Six itself. The entirety of Siege was built off that legacy, and we continue to reference it and build forward with it. Looking in other people's backyards for our solutions, for the game, isn't necessarily going to be the Siege solution, and it's really important we recognize that and know we are a niche experience as well.</em></p>



<p><em>We're a tactical hero-based shooter. Which is, there's not</em> <em>many in that same demographic, let alone at the level of intensity that we're offering. So, not all solutions are going to work with us. There are universal options and design theories and stuff like this that work with a lot of different games, and that's fantastic. But I think in general, it's much healthier for both your community, your team, and the industry to serve your niche as best as possible. And that's really how we focus on it.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-9-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Someone at the event is either a big Phineas and Ferb fan or just a big fan of platypuses.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>On top of that is, the things we are adapting to right now are still answering to the needs of the players, and that's making sure that their appetite for content is satiated, and it's a never ending goal for us, but to be able to quickly deliver new content, new events. We're seeing it with</em> <em>Season 4, we've just been starting to communicate it more and more, we want to be able to make more meaningful change to the game that answers to the needs of the players faster.</em></p>



<p><em>So whether that's meta changing updates so that our players, who love to theory craft, get to make more of those changes sooner, that's something that we want to focus on for now for the future, that answers their needs</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>That's a really good example, because the reality is people consume video games in a very different way than they did 10 years ago, and being able to meet those needs, while at the same time, obviously,</em> <em>we're making sure we're respecting our team and respecting the core base that we're trying to move forward with and the core identity of the game, but a hundred percent this is part of the way we are changing some stuff so we can serve those needs.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-10-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>There was a lot of memorabilia showcasing Rainbow Six Siege's esports history.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How set up for success do you feel under the new regime with Vantage Studios? It's a huge change, and kind of an unavoidable topic. Do you feel set up for success and while revenue is the obvious way everyone measures success, it's not the only way, so how are you measuring success?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>At least when it comes to Vantage Studios and what it means for us, it means that there is commitment and investment in the Rainbow Six game and Siege itself. So, for us, it's when we say we're going to be around for the next 10 years,</em> <em>this is something that can help us build that future as well. So that's something that's really encouraging for the entire team. </em></p>



<p><em>And then speaking as creatives, the way that we're measuring success is looking at the player satisfaction of the game, making sure that the changes we make resonate with them and that we're not alienating our community and we're not disregarding their investment in a game that has been around for 10 years</em> <em>and we want it to be around for 10 more years too.</em></p>



<p><strong>So that's why you'd never make a sequel?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>It's one of the big reasons why we did <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">[Rainbow Six] Siege X</a>, to make sure that we set that new foundation and we don't discard anything. We don't throw out what we've spent so much hard work building for right now.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-11-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Several of the displays included looks at Rainbow Six Siege concept art.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Looking back on the last 10 years, could both of you tell me what moment you are most proud of and what you feel was your biggest mistake in those 10 years?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>I think for me, I mean, this team's seen a lot of different things, different</em> <em>changes. Speaking professionally,</em> <em>going through the COVID time and all of a sudden everybody has to work from home, but still deliver a season every three months. That's probably one of my proudest moments of being a part of this team. Not skipping a beat and finding ways to work in a new environment that we all weren't really sure about</em>. <em>Absolutely one of my proudest moments with the project, with Siege, and with the team itself.</em></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>I'm thinking more about the worst, the second part. But as far as proudest moments of the team and everything like that, shipping [Siege] X was big for us, because we were essentially building a second game at the same time, still supporting one, and that was tough. That was really, really, really tough, and I'm incredibly proud of the team for the work that went in there because...okay.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-12-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Some of these displays felt like a peak into a future where Ubisoft opens a museum like Nintendo.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>I get made fun of a lot on the team now, about this, because I got a little emotional a couple of moments when we were on stages. But that was because in those moments I was thinking about the blood, sweat, and tears that were going into the game, and the hard conversations that were happening and just people literally grinding to get it done, to bring everything they could to it. It was a tremendous amount of effort and work,</em> <em>and again, there's foundational work there, not all of it was player facing, but it set us [up] for Year 11 and beyond</em>, <em>with different things that we can do. But yeah, shipping that felt great, like, just getting it all out there and pulling it off because it was wild that we attempted it, to be honest. [It was] a lot of work</em>.</p>



<p><em>Now, as far as the biggest mistake, that's a tricky one-</em></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>That one's easy. It's Pizza Mozzie. [Karpazis and Mills laugh]. Pizza Mozzie was a customization that we released for a character called Mozzie, our Australian operation, and he looks like, I want to say, he's a pizza slice as a head</em>-</p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>Pizza-the-Hut from Spaceballs or something.</em></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis: </strong><em>Yeah, with googly eyes on it. So that one's on us.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-13-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>A Rainbow Six Siege love story.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>So, I though I had to pick from me specifically, but I'll say, I'll be really honest. When I joined Siege, I was a little slow in my confidence to act on certain things because I was trying to figure out the live pace of the game and understanding how quickly we need to move on different things and stuff like this, because there was, different balancing things that were live for too long, in my opinion, where we could have resolved it faster and I really wish we had, but it was a learning experience, and that's the reality of it. You learn from these, we call them mistakes, but they're learning opportunities, and it was exactly that and it led us to being faster and being more dialed in on how we make certain changes</em>. <em>This is the earlier stuff though, like this is around Grim and Souls kind of things, but learning from that was a big one for me. Pizza Mozzie is a nightmare, but that one, that one's for me.</em></p>



<p><strong>I have one final question, apologies to you Alex because it is for Josh, because I know you worked on Assassin's Creed Valhalla before Siege. You were a level designer, a lead level designer and quest designer. So, are you the reason why the game's so long?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>[Laughs] Okay, so, actually I can tell you this. Anyone who had an issue with a quest after the game's launch, like they had a progression block or whatever, I was the guy who fixed it. So, I joined the team later in production, to come in as the guy to put</em> <em>out a lot of different fires. Like, the drainer quest system, I built that and worked with a bunch of different folks on this, but then I was sent to spot fix different things and all the different quests across the entire game.</em></p>



<p><em>And then after we launched, I ended up doing post-launch support for all the quests, pretty much solo, for a good while there. But, I built out the system for it, so, anytime you'd load your save and maybe you couldn't progress, and then you load it up after a patch and then it worked, I did that for a year of just fixing post-launch support stuff. So, the length of it, I got nothing on that. But I supported all of it though, as far as correcting different things in it and being a spot fixer</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[I’ve been waiting years for Animal Crossing’s best new features]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features</link>
            <guid>1384594</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I never felt done with my <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> island. Despite playing every day for two years, and racking up 1,700 hours of playtime, I somehow never finished decorating. I had plenty of <em>ideas</em> for my island, sure, but actually implementing them was another story: The decorating and terraforming systems that helped make <em>New Horizons</em> a huge success are also slow, manual, and cumbersome, and my patience for decorating and redecorating had finally worn thin.</p><p>Fast-forward a few years, and a very much unexpected update is coming to finally fix some of those pain points. Update 3.0 is launching on January 15th, 2026, alongside the Switch 2 Edition of <em>New Horizons</em>. And while the paid Switch 2 upgrade has some nice-to-haves (like Joy-Con 2 mouse controls for indoor decorating), it’s the free update that brings all the key new features.</p><p>I recently attended a virtual preview for the <em>New Horizons</em> upgrade and update, and there are two caveats: I have not yet played either the Switch 2 version or the new free content myself, and it’s hard to gauge the quality of the Switch 2 version’s visual and performance improvements over a Zoom call. (I still have some unanswered questions about the biggest performance issues on the original Switch, like the choppy frame rate on more densely decorated islands.) But seeing the 3.0 additions in action, it was easy to imagine myself finishing my island — or at least <em>an</em> island.</p><p>As shown in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">October announcement trailer</a>, update 3.0 makes much-needed quality-of-life fixes. You’ll finally be able to craft multiple items at once, <em>and </em>crafting will pull materials from your overall storage instead of your pockets, meaning you won’t have to do a bunch of inventory management just to craft some decor. Then there’s Resetti’s Reset Service, which can help you clean up entire sections of your island instantly so you don’t have to pick everything up individually in order to redecorate. Some players also noticed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkq2sdWhX2Q">a very subtle but potentially impactful change to movement while terraforming</a> that should hopefully make it a smoother process. And then, as if to show off those decorating improvements, Nintendo also added Slumber Islands.</p><p>Not to be confused with dreams, <em>New Horizons</em>’ online island-sharing feature, Slumber Islands are <em>extra</em> sandboxes for you to decorate and play with, where you can set the time of day and the weather and magically conjure up any item you have in your in-game catalog to decorate with, similar to the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC. You can build bridges and inclines instantly by talking to Lloid, rather than going through Tom Nook and waiting (or time traveling) a day. And while it seems like terraforming works the same on Slumber Islands, the apparent addition of strafing while terraforming — instead of having to constantly reorient yourself manually — should help at least a little bit. (It’s the first thing I’m going to test on January 15th, that’s for sure.)</p><p>For me, the worst part of decorating in <em>New Horizons</em> was having an idea, ordering all the furniture I’d need for it over the course of days, testing out the design, realizing it did <em>not</em> look the way I envisioned, and facing the tedious process of breaking it all down and starting over again brick by brick — or, at the very least, having to push and pull objects around for a while to see if I could make it work. The design process I saw on Nintendo’s Slumber Island during the preview, meanwhile, seemed quicker and smoother. Trying out an idea or aesthetic in that environment doesn’t sound like such a tall order.</p><p>Without any hands-on time, I can’t say if it will <em>actually</em> be noticeably easier to design and decorate with the 3.0 update. But I’m excited by the idea that I can go to my Slumber Island scratch pad and try out my designs before committing to them (and the cost in bells to get it all done) on my main island. And maybe, if I really like how it feels to decorate, I’ll make an entire Halloween-themed Slumber Island — the kind of island I’ve wanted to make for years but never did on my main island, where the seasons continue to change and actively ruin the vibe.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian Boss Confirms Divinity Is A Turn-Based RPG, Thinks It’ll Be ‘Way Better’ Than Baldur’s Gate 3]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845</link>
            <guid>1384588</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been less than a week since Larian Studios <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed <em>Divinity</em></a>. Fans have spent much of that time <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105">debating whether it would be an action-RPG</a>.&nbsp;While much of the new game remains mysterious, studio head Swen Vincke isn’t trying to keep that part a secret. He recently confirmed it will indeed be a turn-based game like its other recent hits, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Except he’s also promising it will be “way better” than the 2023<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based Game of the Year winner.</p> <p>“<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was a good game and I’m proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better,” Vincke <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> this week. One challenge during&nbsp;<em>BG3</em>‘s development <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-dnd-races-classes-hours-ps5-xbox-pc-1850590383">was taking the existing ruleset</a> for Wizards of the Coast’s pen-and-paper RPG and adapting it to a video game. “Here, we’re making a system that’s made for a video game. It’s much easier to understand,” he explained.</p>

 <p>Considering <em>BG3</em> is already one of the most beloved games of the last decade, surpassing it will be a tall order, but the veteran developer doesn’t seem worried. “[<em>Divinity</em>] is going to be us unleashed, I think,” Vincke said. “It’s a turn-based RPG featuring everything you’ve seen from us in the past, but it’s brought to the next level.”</p>

 <p>That “next level” includes growing development resources spread across a larger number of studios that will allow the team to make more of the game in parallel, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. Ideally, that should cut down on the development time. Vincke said Larian is aiming for three to four years with <em>Divinity</em>, rather than the six it took to make <em>BG3</em>. It will still start in Early Access, however, and won’t be arriving anytime in 2026.</p> <p>Where will this new level of investment show up? More cinematic scenes and narrative experiments. In other words, the parts of <em>BG3</em> fans loved the most. “We’re doing a couple of things that you haven’t seen in RPGs before, I think,” the Larian cofounder said. I hope <em>Divinity</em> delivers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Watch 8 earlier this year, at a not-so-friendly, but quite justifiable retail price of $350. If you’ve been wanting to upgrade but the high price tag has been holding you back, we bring good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">Thanks to Amazon, you can now snap it up for just $250, after the retailer quite generously took a massive $100 off it</a>. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and you’ll even get free shipping with your purchase, which means $250 is quite literally all you’ve got to pay. The deal applies to the graphite and silver color options. Additionally, Amazon is also offering a free two-month Audible trial with your purchase, which is a service that lets you buy and stream audiobooks, podcasts, and audio shows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Blend of Fitness and Health Features</h2>
<p>At first glance, the watch looks quite similar to its predecessor, but that isn’t really the case. It features a sleek, thinner-than-ever silhouette and offers a snug fit with a sporty style. The screen is both spacious and bright, letting you view your stats, check notifications, keep an eye on the latest news, and more, comfortably throughout the day. The interface has improved, too, so using the thing is going to feel more effortless than ever.</p>
<p>Watch 8 comes packed with a range of health and fitness features. We’re talking Vascular Load monitoring that monitors your stress levels, plus an antioxidant index that uses BioActive Sensor to measure carotenoid levels in your skin. When worn at night, the watch tracks how well you sleep at night, and offers Advanced Sleep Coaching to provide you with tips and insights that can help you rest better. Based on your performance/energy levels of the previous day, it even creates a personalized Energy Score with the help of Galaxy AI. This score lets you see how ready your body is for the upcoming challenges, which you can take into consideration while planning stuff for the day. For instance, a score over 85 indicates you’re well-rested, making it an ideal day to take on the tasks you’ve been putting off. A lower score suggests you need rest, so it might be a good idea to skip an intense workout that day.</p>



<p>Fitness-wise, the watch tracks your steps and comes with a Running Coach that monitors your performance and gives you real-time feedback. There are a bunch of fitness programs built right in, which you can follow to train better. As for the battery, the life depends on how you’re using the watch, but you can expect it to last around 1-2 days. What’s more, Google Gemini integration brings an efficient AI assistant right to your wrist. You can use it to find quick answers, brainstorm ideas, get help with replies, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Connecting it to your smartphone via Bluetooth gets you all your important notifications right on the app. You can check emails or messages, plus manage music without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to grab the latest Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">This deal lets you grab it at a nice $100 discount, for just $250.</a> There are two color options to choose from, and multiple band sizes available.</p>

            <guid>1384582</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has outlined what's new in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-2"><u>Dota 2</u></a> patch 7.40 and provided a rundown of its latest hero, Largo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dota is an ensemble cast, but keen observers looking through the collection of rogues, wizards, druids, and knights (not to mention two characters named 'ranger') may have noticed the absence of that most maligned of hero classes: the bard. At least, up until now," Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>, before introducing Largo himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Largo is the shamanic head of the bardmonk order, and unlike bards that "sing about current events and chord changes," he "tailors every song to his exact circumstances, raising his allies' spirits or, if necessary, their foot speed as they run toward battle (or away). As a frog, his prehensile tongue has, shall we say, all kinds of tricks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One such trick is his Catchy Lick, in which he targets someone, licks them, pulls them back a short distance, and applies a basic dispel. If they're an ally, he pulls them out of harm's way, and if they're an enemy, his tongue deals damage. By dispelling an effect from a target, Largo gets a brief health regen, too. He can also fire froglings that stomp the ground every second, dealing damage and ministuns, and minimize ally mana costs with his Croak of Genius skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ultimate skill is Amphibian Rhapsody. To be honest, with a name as incredible as that, I don't even <em>care</em> what it does, but for those wondering, it's essentially a mini-rhythm game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Largo gets ready to groove," Valve explains. "He is disarmed and his ability bar switches to three song abilities, each with different effects. Songs are only effective if strummed on the beat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every time he strums successfully, he gains a stack of Groovin'. Each stack gives him bonus armor and reduces the mana cost of every song, but he loses a stack if he misses a beat. Stacks linger for a short duration when Largo's song ends."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is tradition, the full patch notes are so huuuge they're too big to publish on Steam itself, <a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>but you can find them on the Dota 2 website right here</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Built with Unreal Engine 5, Legacy of Atlantis is due out next year as the franchise marks its 30th anniversary, with Catalyst set to follow in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some, quite naturally, suggest starting at the beginning makes sense given the anniversary, others are wondering if the announcement of the new game means the team has to go back and retcon some aspects of Lara Croft's story to make sure everything makes sense in the character's 30-year-old canon timeline.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are many theories about why the reimagining of TR1 is happening. Some say it’s only because of the 30th anniversary but I personally think it’s happening because it HAS to happen. We’re entering a new unified timeline where some things need to be retconned and some need to be reimagined," suggested X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/merychxrry/status/2000648075636011212" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Merychxrry</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This kind of reimagining will likely need to happen for every mainline game, but especially for these four story-heavy titles: Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, Tomb Raider: Legend, and Tomb Raider: Underworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might ask, 'Why not TR2-3 first?' Well, they’re not story-heavy. As much as I’d love to see them remade, we first need to unify these four story-focused games. Otherwise, it would take too long to reach them, and their stories would need to be retconned."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Mery added, the order itself likely doesn't matter — "it could be 4 and 6 first, then Legends and Underworld, or vice-versa" — but since the assets for Legacy of Atlantis will be available first, "it shouldn't take too long to produce these games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That is actually genius!" <a href="https://x.com/Gamer_0wl/status/2000772462947037443?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a> one commenter, while another <a href="https://x.com/jaylennasir/status/2000792479189364981?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "Yes! This exactly!" "I feel like LOA is a test, like the [Resident Evil 2] remake was, <a href="https://x.com/itslooona/status/2000662255583494539?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> someone else. "TR1 was the safest choice they had for a reimagining because of its simple story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As game director Will Kerslake recently told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>, Catalyst fits into the timeline <em>after</em> the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld. The most recent games, known as the Survivor reboot trilogy — 2013's Tomb Raider, 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider, and 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider — are still considered as part of Croft's origin story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the news of the recasting was a surprise for some, actor Camilla Luddington — who portrayed Lara Croft in the Survivor Trilogy — shared a bittersweet Instagram post about her time as the lead this week, saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lara-croft-survivor-trilogy-actor-camilla-luddington-passes-the-baton-to-alix-wilton-regan-who-takes-on-the-role-for-tomb-raider-catalyst-and-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>she loved the fans and Croft will "forever be a part of [her]</u></a>." Alix Wilton Regan will now play Lara Croft in both Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and Tomb Raider: Catalyst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there's the upcoming Amazon TV show to consider. The live-action Tomb Raider Prime Video series, which will star <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> alum Sophie Turner, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-amazon-tv-show-will-reinvent-the-franchise-on-a-massive-scale">will “reinvent the franchise on a massive scale”</a> and will interconnect “live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

                <p>In November, a modder going by the name Froddoyo released Project Misriah, which used Valve's Counter-Strike 2 as a medium to recreate Halo 3. The mod was well-received by fans, but apparently not by Microsoft itself. Microsoft filed a takedown request with Valve, and the latter complied.</p><p>Froddoyo described Project Misriah as "a workshop collection of Halo ported maps and assets that aims to bring a Halo 3 multiplayer-like experience to Counter-Strike 2." It also directly lifted character models, maps, gameplay mechanics, and sound effects from Halo 3, which may have contributed to Microsoft's desire to have the mod removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ki1RQF0-jyk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Froddoyo shared the takedown on X, and wrote, "It was fun while it lasted. Make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft!"</p><p>In a separate comment posted on the trailer's YouTube page, Froddoyo thanked players for supporting the mod but noted that it will not uploaded again. In a more hopeful message, Froddoyo added, "We will use the knowledge and skills obtained from this to cook up something else!"</p><p>It's unclear if Microsoft has any plans to revisit Halo 3 or any of the other classic games in the franchise beyond the first one. The original Halo: Combat Evolved is getting a modern remake called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, which will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the franchise while launching simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 in 2026. There are reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-last-update-arrives-this-month-as-devs-move-to-other-halo-projects/1100-6536070/" data-ref-id="1100-6536070">other unannounced Halo games</a> currently in the works, but it's unclear what Halo Studios will release after Campaign Evolved.</p>

                <p>Despite Silksong's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">highly successful launch</a> in September, Team Cherry hasn't forgotten about the game that started it all. The indie studio has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> will be getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in 2026, with a performance update also inbound for all other platforms.</p><p>Team Cherry says the Hollow Knight update will be similar to the upgrade that Silksong received in its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition: high frame rate modes, options for higher resolutions, and other graphical upgrades. Also similar to Silksong, all players who already own the Nintendo Switch version of Hollow Knight will get the Switch 2 Edition for free when it launches.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In preparation for the Switch 2 upgrade, Hollow Knight is going to get a major update across all platforms, which will serve to add new features and patch up bugs in the game. Players on PC will be able to preview some of these upgrades in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new public beta branch</a> for Hollow Knight, available to test through Steam or GOG. The beta update includes official support for people playing on Steam Deck or ultrawide monitors, with full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support.</p><p>Team Cherry hasn't shared a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, only saying that it will arrive sometime in 2026. The studio has also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-getting-a-free-nautical-themed-expansion/1100-6536988/" data-ref-id="1100-6536988">a new free expansion for Silksong</a>, Sea of Sorrow, which is also scheduled to release in 2026.</p><p>It's been a big year for the Australian indie studio, with the surprise release of Hollow Knight: Silksong in September after an extended seven-year development period. Silksong took home the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">award for Best Action Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and was included as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2025/2900-7322/" data-ref-id="2900-7322">GameSpot's 10 best games of 2025</a>.</p>

The nautical-themed Sea of Sorrow expansion will arrive sometime in 2026, and will be free for all players.</p><p>Team Cherry released a brief teaser trailer for Sea of Sorrow but hasn't revealed many details about the upcoming expansion other than that it will include new areas, bosses, tools, and more. The trailer description teased that players will be able to "voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas" when Sea of Sorrow arrives next year.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77QBk4Gc6w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c77QBk4Gc6w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Based on the small vignettes shown in the trailer, it seems likely that Sea of Sorrow will be set in Pharloom Bay, a seaside area featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-reveal-trailer/2300-6448356/" data-ref-id="2300-6448356">Silksong's reveal trailer</a> that was cut from the final game.

The studio once again isn't planning on giving incremental updates during development, saying that they will be releasing more information on Sea of Sorrow "shortly before" release.</p>

<section><p>Divinity game director Swen Vincke and writing director Adam Smith sat down with GameSpot to talk about their follow-up to Baldur’s Gate 3 right after its announcement at this year’s Game Awards.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">After a lot of back and forth on the internet regarding what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/" data-ref-id="1100-6536779">Geoff Keighley’s demonic obelisk</a> could mean, it was finally revealed at The Game Awards that the statue was related to Divinity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/divinity-official-larian-studios-teaser-trailer-with-full-intro-from-the-game-awards-2025/2300-6466578/" data-ref-id="2300-6466578">the next game from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios</a>. Shortly after that reveal, we at GameSpot received an email asking if we would like to go sit with game director Swen Vincke and writing director Adam Smith to talk about the game once the show concluded.</p><p dir="ltr">Post-TGA plans sorted.</p><p dir="ltr">Returning to Divinity was always, eventually, in the cards for the team at Larian, but it wasn’t the original plan following Baldur’s Gate 3. “ We were gonna do more Dungeons and Dragons, so we were in the process of figuring out what that was,” says Smith. “And one fateful day, we sat down and realized that we weren't excited and we don't wanna make a game we're not excited about. And so we said, ‘Can we go back to Divinity right away?’”</p><p dir="ltr">In order to do that, the team knew that they had a lot of work ahead of them. While Rivellon, the setting of the Divinity games, has been deeply explored in previous entries, Larian had never actually sat down to build their universe from the ground up before.</p><p dir="ltr">“We learned from BG3 the importance of having a ruleset, allure, and a world solidified behind you,” says Vincke. “It was quite a lot of work actually. [Now] we know what the days of the week are. We know what people eat in the evening. We know the way they dress. All these things needed to be sorted out. So as progress grew, we started saying, ‘Okay, well this is a really good cornerstone for everything that we've built. And there's never been a real Divinity, so let's just call it Divinity. People will henceforth refer to it as the Divinity Universe quickly and like it.’”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623334" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623334"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both Divinity and Baldur’s Gate 3 share a lot of connective tissue; rich, fantasy worlds filled with magic and a diverse roster of races. However, when it comes to gameplay, the two are quite different. While the Original Sin duology bears somewhat of a resemblance to Baldur’s Gate 3, previous installments prior to those games have looked more like titles such as Diablo and The Witcher. So what should players expect from this new Divinity? “Agency,” says Vincke plainly. “Agency at every level. In the systems and how you can develop your character, your identity, and then also obviously in the narrative and the choices that you make.”</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke then points out how dark the trailer for the game that premiered at the TGAs is. “ We have this thing that the player will be the one that brings light into the darkness or pushes it completely into deeper darkness,” says Vincke. “ We want you to be surprised at the level of things that you can do.”</p><p dir="ltr">When pressed for more granular details on the gameplay, Smith adds that the team wants the game to speak for itself when it's ready to be shown. “You don't want to be told, 'This is what it's gonna do.' You want to see it,” says Smith. “You know the kind of games we make, so you can speculate from there. But we'll put it in front of you as soon as we're ready to, and then you'll see what it is.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623335" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623335"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Divinity is likely to be the first game in the series that many players will experience thanks to the immense popularity of Baldur’s Gate 3, the team is making sure that existing fans of the franchise also feel it to be a continuation of what has come before. “We ensure that that continuity is present. If you didn't know it, you will [still] fully understand everything that's going on,” says Vincke.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke explains that it will be akin to how Baldur’s Gate 3 had plenty of continuity with the previous games in the series but didn't require you to have played Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2 to understand it. He also points out that the Original Sin installments sold over 10 million copies, and therefore, there should be a large returning player-base in addition to those coming from BG3 as their first Larian title.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it’s easy to see how the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 might put enormous pressure on the development of Divinity to live up to player expectations. However, it’s not something that the team at Larian is concerning themselves with, as Smith points toward how much space there is left in the RPG genre to iterate and innovate. “Clair Obscur is so different to us and they nailed it, right? I think they did something very similar to us in that they made the game they wanted to make, [but] they did it in a completely different way [with] a completely different skeleton,” says Smith.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623336" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623336"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite feeling that Divinity doesn’t need to compete with Baldur’s Gate 3, Vincke is very confident that their new game is a step up from their previous outing. “ It's going to be better, in my opinion, on all fronts,” says Vincke. “ One of the biggest struggles that we had with Baldur’s Gate 3 is every single class has almost different rulesets, so getting players on board with that was quite complicated. I'm surprised actually that it worked out that well. I think when you see what we can do when we make something for a video game that’s not derived from a tabletop, it's going to be a lot better.”</p><p dir="ltr">For those that want to get a taste of what Divinity may have to offer, the previous installment in the franchise, Original Sin 2, just launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/10/aaero-review/">Aaero</a> came out of nowhere, and remains, to this day, one of my favourite rhythm-action games. Merging the classic gunplay of Space Harrier and Panzer Dragoon with musical movement was an inspired creative decision, and Aaero had you riding the rails – called ribbons here – in time with a bass-heavy electronic soundtrack, using your craft to mimic the changing notes. Aaero2: Black Razor Edition sees the Mad Fellows team returning to their signature series, this time boasting a stellar soundtrack from Monstercat, new multiplayer modes, and additional music packs, promising to take players on an even wilder ride through space.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aaero2: Black Razor Edition | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZ7g_muNvfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Riding the ribbon is an exercise in deft left stick control. You roll from left to right, but as the music features pauses or major note changes, you’ll find yourself launching your spacecraft from point to point, trying to hang onto the ribbon and, in turn, your health. It’s far trickier than it has any business being, but, like a NASCAR driver, this is all about keeping things smooth, gently coaxing your craft around the track.</p>


<p>You’ve also got to think about shooting. The right stick controls your weaponry, and you can lock onto enemies by holding the reticule over them, increasing the number of missiles the longer you stay in one spot. If you release your missiles in time with the music, you’ll ramp up your score, and if you get it perfectly on the beat, you’ll immediately reload any empty missile slots.</p>


<p>You’ve also got an autocannon for faster-moving enemies, and the better you aim, the more points you’ll earn for each shot. When you’re chasing high scores – each track gives you a star rating and a percentage indicator – Aaero2 gives you a lot to think about. It all fits together perfectly once you’re in the flow of it, even if it feels like rubbing your stomach while patting your head at times.</p>
<p>Aaero2 wouldn’t work without a thumping soundtrack to accompany the sci-fi action, and it doesn’t disappoint, with one of the best electronic-infused line-ups since Wipeout. Collected via the Monstercat label – Beat Saber fans will definitely recognise the name – there’s something here for everyone. There’s a trio of MUZZ tracks; Salvation (ft. Bloodhounds) absolutely slaps, while Nemesis is an adrenaline ride of a track. There’s also artists like Habstrakt and Stonebank who keep your sub working overtime, while there’s plenty of light and dark thanks to Hoaprox, YUAN and Haneri collaborating on the more mellow Saviour.</p>

<p>This is a soundtrack that repeatedly had me grinning ear from ear, and when it’s combined with the sci-fi visuals flashing past, Aaero2 is capable of achieving the same kind of synaesthesia that you experience in Tetris Effect, Rez and Lumines Arise. In fact, in Aaero2, Mad Fellows have crafted the most Mizuguchi-like game I’ve found outside of his own teams, and that’s a huge achievement. Music is always going to be individual, and produce a unique response, but this feels like a Monstercat album that’s been produced just for me.</p>
<p>Aaero2 features a series of daily and weekly challenges, with each task netting you a chunk of extra experience. They might ask you to complete a track without using any missiles, or to beat every boss in one week, but they give you an extra reason to check back in for a cheeky extra track or two, and broadly add some longevity to proceedings, even for the most ardent ribbon-rider.</p>
<p>Also, each track’s star and completion percentage tickles the completionist part of your brain perfectly, and you’ll be locking in time after time, trying to perfect one more missile hit, or hold the ribbon just a fraction better. On the normal setting, Aaero2 is a little bit more forgiving on the ribbon riding than its predecessor, locking in more securely, though it doesn’t suddenly make it a breeze by any means.</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed your first run through all the tracks though, you’ll unlock Advanced, which removes the magnetic ribbon lock, gives you full ribbons and also more enemies to deal with. This is Aaero2’s true form, with a serious level of challenge, and the opportunity to hit some proper high scores. The fact that there’s Master difficulty above that only goes to show how much challenge the team at Mad Fellows has eked out of Aaero’s gameplay, but no matter what difficulty you’re playing on, it remains utterly enthralling.</p>
<p>You can share that experience with others as well. While online leaderboards remain central to the experience – I love reviewing unreleased games, as I’m currently the best in the world at a series of Aaero2’s tracks – the new multiplayer modes let you play in two-player co-op or PvP, both online or from the comfort of your own couch. It adds a new level of competition and collaboration to proceedings, and if you’ve got a similar taste in music to your friends or family, Aaero2 is an absolute blast.</p>

              <p>It looks like the wait for&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 3</em> won’t be&nbsp;<em>quite</em> as long as that between&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>s <em>1</em> and <em>2</em>. Dambuster Studios, the team that took over development of the second mainline entry in the sprawling zombie series, remains at the helm for the follow-up, aiming for a 2028 release.</p> <p>As detailed <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">by Timur222 on X</a>, Dambuster’s latest financial statements state that the UK-based subsidiary of Deep Silver (and thus Embracer) has moved straight on from 2024’s release of&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition</em> to working on the direct follow-up as its “primary focus.” Right now all developers are working on the game, while those in QA will be moving over too, once Luna and Mac versions of <em>DI2U&nbsp;</em>are out the door. The details state that “feature, character, world and story design” are all “moving at pace,” all with a view to releasing in the first half of 2028.</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em> appeared in 2011, developed by Polish team Techland, and despite being a solid zombie first-person action-RPG, arrived in a mess of mistakes and controversies. Chief among them was the <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-games-special-edition-comes-with-a-statue-of-a-bik-5976075">severed torso statue of a bikini-clad woman</a> included in the game’s special edition, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/whoops-you-might-be-playing-an-unfinished-version-of-d-5837480">releasing the internal development build onto Steam</a> instead of the final game on launch didn’t really help. Still, once fixed, it was fun—nothing exceptional, but fun.</p>

 <p>Techland followed it up two years later with a standalone expansion (remember when we called those “expandalones” for a minute?),&nbsp;<em>Dead Island: Riptide</em>, but had a cooler reception given it repeated so many of the things that held the first game back from being great. There then came a crappy spin-off called&nbsp;<em>Escape Dead Island</em>, a rapidly abandoned MOBA called <em>Dead Island: Epidemic</em>, a remastering of the original, and a canned mobile spin-off that never saw a release. At the same time, Techland opted out of making&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2</em>, instead moving on to much greater success with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>, meaning Deep Silver had to find a new studio. That was German team Yager Development, best known for <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em>, with an expected 2015 release. It didn’t go well.</p>

 <p>By July 2015, Deep Silver announced they’d taken the game back off Yager and handed it to UK studio Sumo Digital (<em>Crackdown 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Team Sonic Racing</em>), issuing annual proof-of-life statements for the project until 2019 when it was declared that it had changed developers yet again. That time it went to another UK team, Dambuster (formed from the ashes of the collapse of Crytek UK), and in 2023 it was <em>finally</em> released, some eight years later than originally intended. It was fine!</p> <p>It also sold well enough to justify continuing on, and we now know that Dambuster has been working on the third mainline entry since it shipped the remaster of the sequel. For what it’s worth, the financial report <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history">filed in the UK</a> also shows that the 194-person-strong company made a profit in 2024, and is sitting on assets of over £2 million. Dambuster is owned by Deep Silver, which is owned by Plaion, which is owned by Embracer, which is owned by Cthulhu.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-apple-watch-samsung-quietly-clears-out-the-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-cheaper-than-black-friday-2000653577</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For those who love to stay active in the great outdoors—whether running, swimming, cycling, hiking, or really any workout you can do outside of four walls and a ceiling—the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the ultimate companion for your wrist. Designed with fitness enthusiasts in mind, it offers a rugged build and supports a wide range of activities to help you track your fitness progress. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/">This outdoor-ready smartwatch is currently available at a 23% discount, dropping from its original price of $650 to a more affordable $500 during this holiday season.</a></p>
<p>When we’ve written about this watch previously, it’s discount has usually come with the caveat of needing to trade-in an old watch. Not this time though. You can just save $150 without departing with any of your current tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Rugged Titanium Build</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra boasts a durable 47mm titanium face that can withstand impacts, bumps, and the rigors of outdoor activities. This tough design ensures it stands up to the elements while maintaining a sleek appearance. The titanium comes in a few color options—titanium gray, titanium white, titanium blue, and titanium silver—so you can choose one that best suits your style. The watch also offers several band choices, including a synthetic Peakform band, and a fabric-based trail band, a more robust marine band. Though, all options for this listing come exclusively with the marine band. I’m personally a big fan of the titanium gray variant as that one’s included band is a sleek orange.</p>
<p>Along with tracking your workouts, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is able to monitor your overall health. the watch tracks your sleep and daily energy levels, providing a “physical readiness” score based on factors like the quality of your sleep, heart rate, and step count.</p>
<p>The heart rate tracking is exceptionally accurate. Powered by Galaxy AI, the watch can filter out unnecessary physical movements, allowing it to deliver more precise heart rate data to help you fine-tune your workouts for better results.</p>



<p>For an added bonus, the watch gives personalized wellness tips, offering insights based on your daily activities, sleep patterns, and heart health that can help you optimize your well-being.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra’s battery can go for up to 60 hours on a single charge, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of juice before your next workout. This extended battery life is particularly useful for sleep tracking. While many other smartwatches struggle to last&nbsp; a full day, night time becomes when you might want to charge it. With those, you never end up getting to utilize the sleep features. The Galaxy Watch Ultra only needs to charge every few days you can still use it to track your sleep throughout the night. The watch can even detect potential sleep apnea.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/">Normally priced at $650, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is now available at a significant 23% discount.</a> Save yourself $150 as you bring the price down to $500. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or just looking for a tough and reliable fitness watch, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is a perfect choice. Makes for a great gift for the fitness freaks in your life this holiday season.</p>

<p>ARC Raider developers have confirmed that player behaviour is analysed while matchmaking. </p>



<p><span>Embark Studios’ latest&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank">extraction adventure</a>, ARC Raiders, has been on a great run lately.</span> Not only is it one of the most popular titles of 2025, but it also won best multiplayer game of the year at The Game Awards 2025. What’s more, the title’s new update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-flickering-flames-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cold Snap</a>, is live now. Ahead of the update, the developers gave players a hint about ARC Raiders matchmaking. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-confirm-player-behaviour-is-analysed-for-matchmaking">ARC Raiders Devs Confirm Player Behaviour is Analysed for Matchmaking</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, ARC Raiders art director Robert Sammelin confirmed that player behaviour is factored in while matchmaking in ARC Raiders. Sammelin stated, “Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.” When asked if he could elaborate on this, the art director said “no” jokingly, keeping players in the dark about how it is factored in during matchmaking. </p>



<p>There was a prevailing theory in the ARC Raiders community that players with nicer behaviour would be matched with others with similar gameplay styles, while more aggressive players would be forced to play together. The developers have now confirmed that this could indeed be the case; however, we do not know what else is factored into matchmaking. </p>







<p>In other news, an ARC Raiders backpack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-backpack-crashed-nvidia-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-handedly crashed the NVIDIA website</a>. Additionally, the developers recently asked the community for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-map-design-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical feedback on the game’s map pool</a>, asking them to drive the game forward.

            <p>Dambuster Studios are planning to keep their next truckload of undead penned in for a few more years, before opening the big zombie door in early 2028. That's according to some financial docs from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island">Dead Island</a> developers, in which their plans for Dead Island 3 as of the end of March this year are laid bare.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The docs, spotted by a Twitterer with the handle <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">@bogorad222</a>, are Dambuster's annual financial report for the fiscal year that ended on March 31st, 2025. As such, they contain many numbers, but also a section on the studio's current strategy.</p>
<p>Basically, the plan is to now go full steam ahead on Dead Island 3. All Dambuster’s developers are now working on Dead Island 3, to be joined by the studio's QA staff once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Luna and Mac versions are done and dusted. "Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace," the report says of DA3, before whipping out that planned release window of some point in 2028's first two financial quarters.</p>
<p>Putting things into real human years, that window likely means the third zombpocalyspse will come by the end of June 2028, assuming things go to the current plan.</p>
<p>This the first concrete news we've gotten about Dead Island 3, unless you count Dambuster teasing it with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243?snr=2___">a Steam post</a> which mentioned they're "already carving out what comes next" back in September. At any rate, you've got plenty of time to read back over our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-island-2-review">Dead Island 2 review</a>, in which Rick Lane judged that while "not worth waiting eleven years for", it's "a breezy, messy adventure that has zero nutritional value, but will fill your bloodstream with yummy, delicious sugar."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-drops-its-microsd-card-below-0-13-per-gb-for-holidays-the-cheapest-nintendo-switch-storage-upgrade-2000653790</link>
            <guid>1384483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage issues are common, but also avoidable. If you’re running out of storage on your Nintendo Switch 2 and often find yourself deleting some titles to make room for new ones, investing in an SD card can be a smart move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 256GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card for just $33, after taking 40% off its usual $55 retail price</a>. Prime members get to enjoy free delivery, so they’re saving a few extra dollars on that front too. This is also the lowest we have seen this memory card drop to since its release, but as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. We suggest getting your orders in as soon as you can before the price shoots back up – which could be any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Capacity With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>Starting with the storage; you’re getting a nice 256GB of additional storage with this card, which translates into more space for the latest releases, updates, DLC, and even screenshots. You will be able to have all the titles you like installed and ready to go; no need to choose what to delete to make room for something new every few weeks. The capacity this version gets you should be enough for casual gamers who mostly play smaller indie titles. However, if you’re looking to download a bunch of large AAA games, you might want to consider grabbing the 512GB version, which is sitting at $100 at the time of writing. This will help you avoid the same old loop where you find yourself with limited storage every few weeks.</p>
<p>As for the performance, you’re looking at sequential read speeds up to 800 MB/s, which helps load games considerably faster than the brand’s standard microSD cards. That means spending less time on loading or updating, and quicker game launches. Despite the impressive capabilities, the card maintains an ideal temperature as it works, even during intense matches. That’s thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guards, which work tirelessly to keep the card from overheating while ensuring smooth performance.</p>



<p>Best of all, the card is made to work with Nintendo Switch 2, plus it plays nicely with a range of microSD UHS-I devices, including computers, handheld consoles, tablets, and even cameras. When using it with a camera, you can expect it to capture stunning 4K video and photos like a pro!</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 6-proof protection with a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase. It’s basically temperature, drop, magnet, water, X-ray, and wearout proof, which means you’ll enjoy consistent performance 24/7. Samsung Magician software helps you keep an eye on the health of the card and monitor performance with ease.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for an easy way of boosting the overall storage of your console while still enjoying good performance, this P9 Express microSD card can be a good addition to your setup.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/"> It normally goes for $55, which is already quite affordable considering all that you’re getting, but the current 40% discount makes it even more approachable.</a> And since it works with a range of devices, now is a great time to pick a couple of these for your cameras, tablet, or even laptop – without blowing your budget!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Crystal Dynamics has revealed that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will receive a difficulty adjustment for modern players, and players might remember the original version as extremely difficult. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a great day for the original Tomb Raider fans, as Legacy of Atlantis was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced for 2026</a>. It is a complete remake of the original game, built from the ground up. Now, the developer has revealed that the remake might not be as brutal as the original title. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-to-receive-a-difficulty-adjustment">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to Receive a Difficulty Adjustment</h2>



<p>During a presentation attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked how they would be targeting the difficulty of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, given all the insta-death situations and other problems players faced in the original title. Kerslake replied, stating that “part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes.”</p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean the core Tomb Raider experience will change, as “there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action.” Also, players will also “see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades,” added Kerslake. </p>



<p>The Anniversary edition of Tomb Raider also had a workaround for the original’s difficulty, adding quick-time events to get through the insta-kill situations. </p>







<p>In other news, Tomb Raider: Catalyst will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-players-will-require-no-homework-before-jumping-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require ‘no homework’</a> before jumping in. Additionally, the co-creator of the original game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-co-creator-prefers-new-chapters-over-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prefers new chapters over remakes</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been going from strength to strength this year. Following its release back in April, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">game was met with widespread acclaim</a> and sales to match. In May, the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>. In October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">that figure was updated to over 5m copies worldwide across all formats</a>.</p>
<p>But, that number has since increased further, and according to <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics">Alinea Analytics, </a>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold "almost" 400k copies since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">its record-breaking Game Awards nominations</a> on 17th November. Meanwhile, the company's <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472/photo/1">head of market analysis Rhys Elliott</a> estimates Clair Obscur has "sold an extra 200k+ copies since" The Game Awards last week, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">scooped up the coveted Game of the Year accolade among others</a>.</p>

<p>To break that down further, Elliott said 76 percent of those sales were on Steam, with 21 percent on PS5 and three percent on Xbox. "Around 52 thousand Xbox players" have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-xbox-game-passs-biggest-third-party-success-2025">since played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 via Game Pass</a> "for the first time" as well, Elliott added.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>, meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has received a notable uptake in player numbers since last week's award show, as you can see in the graph below.</p>
<p>The Sunday before this year's The Game Awards welcomed 22,759 Clair Obscur players on Steam, while the Sunday after saw 56,993 players. That's an increase of 34,234 players between those two specific days.</p>

<p>The success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p>
<p>During the awards show last week, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> fans have discovered a load of unused conversations between the game's controversial NPCs.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games where Samus is mostly isolated and alone, the latest in the series sees Samus rescuing and interacting with an ensemble of Federation soldiers. This has proven unpopular with many players, who feel it undermines its otherwise mysterious tone.</p>
<p>Now, YouTuber Bearborg has uploaded a video of all base camp interactions in the game, including unused dialogue, which were taken from the game's files (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">VGC</a>). The video includes over 41 minutes of dialogue, of which around 34 minutes is unused.</p>

<p>As this extra dialogue was all recorded, it suggests the game originally had far more incidental conversations between its characters, which were (perhaps rightfully) paired back.</p>
<p>Cut conversations include discussions on how much robot VUE-995 can bench press, MacKenzie's lack of field experience, and Armstrong finding out about roast beasts, among many others. It's mostly more humorous dialogue that adds little to the story, which is likely why it was cut.</p>

<p>In the final version of the game, these characters are little more than broad, stereotypical sketches. Yet as Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson explained, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-chatty-companions-silent-samus-the-problem">Metroid Prime 4 suffers more from Samus's own lack of dialogue by comparison</a>.</p>
<p>"It's presentationally clear here that Samus just isn't talking," he wrote. "The feeling of awkward weirdness only grows as the game winds on. These guys begin throwing their lives on the line for this woman who offers nothing back in return. This might even work if they acknowledged their leader's silence - but they don't. Everyone just acts like this is all normal. Maybe it is, with this being Samus' in-universe reputation. Either way, it sucks."</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 was eagerly awaited for 18 years until its release earlier this month. Unfortunately, for many it has not lived up to expectations.</p>
<p>"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Narrative]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Why do we love games? The enjoyment is more than just the bright screens and the action taking place, thought that is usually a big part of it. Another is the story and narrative of games, which can go in all sorts of directions and be told in ways that are very different to books, film, or theatre. Many of the most lauded games are celebrated not just because of gameplay, but for the tales of their characters and the narrative we experience alongside them, the ones that draw us in until we’re eagerly reading messages sent between coworkers while hacking their computers. Which brings us nicely to our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game=of-the-year-2025">Game of the Year 2025</a> Best Narrative standouts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">Hundred Line Last Defense Academy</a> is our winner of Best Narrative, or should that be Best <em>Narratives</em>? A story of 15 students having to survive 100 days while holding back monsters, and dealing with the different relationships between the characters while they fight to survive. It is a mammoth game with players able to work towards a staggering 100 different endings. Putting together one narrative is tough enough for most games, so doing it 100 times over and tying those into every single choice you make is work that should be rewarded.</p>


<p>I’m going to quote Miguel here who summed up Hundred Line Last Defense Academy by saying, “It’s this beautifully overwhelming web of stories and paths and branching events where, like, two people can spend dozens of hours playing the game and never have the same experience, or you can just pick it up any time and discover a new story and a new ending. It’s such an insane achievement.”</p>
<h3>Dispatch – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The expectations for Dispatch were high, just from knowing that it was coming from a team that had previously worked on Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us. Where would they take their episodic storytelling next? Perhaps to offer a fresh perspective on the superhero genre,&nbsp;while also tapping into and succeeding at creating a heartfelt and funny adventure.</p>

<p>You are Robert Robertson, previously known as the hero Mecha Man, who after losing to his nemesis is taken off hero duties and becomes a superhero dispatcher instead, swapping punches for office politics. Office politics are tough enough to deal with, but even more so in Dispatch as you work with ex-supervillains to put them on the path of good. It is also a narrative the explores the themes of identity and learning about who you are as person, while dealing with problems from small issues in the office to life threatening ones that pile on the pressure. Dispatch is a game whose narrative is going to be remembered for a long time.</p>
<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Death is hard enough to deal with as it is when it comes for a loved one. The confusion, the grief, the anger, the reflection, and finally the acceptance are all parts of the journey when it comes. But what if you knew when death was coming for you, and not just you but everyone the same age as you? That is the story Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, where a group of people head out to end the Paintress before she paints the number 33 and wipes out anyone of that age.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a strong story supported by a cast of characters that are memorable, leading to you wanting to spend time with them. Behind it all though is the worry that the Expedition, like so many others before, will fail and the Paintress will live to come after the next age the following year. Alongside that fear and worry are moments of joy and wonder, with the world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 providing a stunning playground in which to enjoy the expansive story that has touched so many this year and will do so for years to come. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is not just a game for RPG fans, it is a game for those who love everything about stories.</p>
