		<p>Getting a big new trailer and gameplay reveal during the Xbox Developer_Direct was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> – the next game from Compulsion Games, the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/09/we-happy-few-review/">We Happy Few</a>. South of Midnight is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PC and will be day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> when it launches on 8th April 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight - Story Trailer | Developer_Direct 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klgw-To1rqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> looks to be something rather different compared to Compulsion’s previous work, whisking us away to the fantasy world of Prospero and confronting our heroine Hazel with giant sea monsters.</p>
<p>Hazel is a 19-year-old with a remarkable set of abilities that emerge through the game as she discovers and becomes a Weaver. These abilities let her see beyond the surface of the world, viewing the strands that tap into a deeper reality and the Grand Tapestry that binds everything together.</p>
<p>As she repairs the world around her, it can and will reveal that mythical creatures are actually real… such as the narrator and companion that is Catfish.</p>

<p>The game features an almost claymation visual style, blending together action adventure exploration with Bayonetta-style combat, using her spindle, weaving hooks and more alongside her magical abilities to push, pull and weave.</p>
<p>The world also blends together vibes of the deep south of America with giant, island-sized alligators and more. That is just one of the huge creatures that she will seek out as she tries to find out what happened to her mother in the natural disaster that befell the region.</p>
<p>She will also be able to peel back the past by viewing echoes of events that happened, reliving them on her adventure. There’s deep scars through the world, whether it’s seeing buildings that have been reclaimed by nature, or people that have stayed behind.</p>
<p>All of this is being brought to life in an intriguing stop motion style, calling back to Compulsion’s roots as a studio.</p>

<p>During the showcase, Game Director Jasmin Roy discussed some of South of Midnight's key spells:</p>
<p><em>Push, Pull, and Weave are some of the spells at your disposal that give you a tactical advantage during a fight. Timing is everything. Pull distant enemies close to start melee combos, push them back to interrupt and stun their attack, then press the advantage with follow-up strikes.</em></p>

<p>The game is expected to take between ten to twelve hours to complete.</p>

			<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, the first new main entry in the series developed by Team NINJA in years, has been announced today for PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The fourth main entry in the series, which is being developed in collaboration with PlatinumGames, was revealed during today's Xbox Developer Direct with an action-packed trailer that highlighted how the new game will masterfully combine the challenging gameplay the series is known for with PlatinumGames fast-paced gameplay. Playable characters Yakumo and series' protagonist Ryu Hayabusa will be able to take on a variety of powerful enemies using different fighting styles as well as some of the series' iconic special techniques, such as the Izuna Drop. With a level design featuring enhanced verticality and dynamism and a lot of challenges and secrets hidden inside this chaotic and dark recreation of Tokyo, Ninja Gaiden 4 is looking to be a more than worthy new entry in the series.</p>

As the name implies, <em>The Dark Ages</em> is set in a medieval fantasy realm and takes place long before the events of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/27/11795652/doom-review">the franchise’s 2016 reboot</a>. The developers say that the new game features a much bigger world with a larger emphasis on story — including plenty of cutscenes — but the most important changes appear to be with how <em>The Dark Ages</em> will play.</p><p>A big focus this time around is on melee combat. Since this is a <em>Doom</em> set in medieval times, that means players will get access to brutal new melee weapons like a spiked mace and iron flail. The scale of battles also seems to have ramped up. We already knew that players would get a mount in the form of a cybernetic dragon, but today’s reveal also showed off a skyscraper-sized mech suit so that the Doomslayer can fight enemies the size of kaiju.</p><p>Another big change is a greater emphasis on accessibility through a series of gameplay sliders. These let you adjust things like the game speed or parry timing, either ramping them up or down. Essentially, these options should give players the ability to really customize the experience, either making it more approachable or a whole lot harder. There are standard difficulty options as well.</p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is coming to the PS5, Xbox, and PC when it launches in May.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo have announced Ninja Gaiden 4, the first new numbered entry in the bloodthirsty third-person action series since 2012. Trailered at this evening's Xbox Developer Direct, it releases for PC in fall 2025, and they're working on it in collaboration with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata devs Platinum Games. All of which very much tickles my dismemberable gizzards. Here's the reveal video.

<p>
The game introduces new character Yukumo, a young ninja from the Raven clan. He'll cut a path through a cyberpunk Tokyo that is being steadily warped out of shape by a cursed rain, the Darkrot, generated by some kind of evil dragon. Ninja Gaiden's original protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is also playable and will play a "pivotal" role in the story. The  Hayabusa and Raven clans are rivals, so you can expect the two leads to lock blades, though it seems inevitable that they will eventually team up to ding over that dastardly dragon.
</p>
<p>
Footage for the game is very much what you're expecting: extremely fast sword combos, lots of limb removal, an emphasis on parrying and countering, and some stomach-turning finishers. Yukumo has some kind of sorcerous, pop-out wing you can use for aerial moves, together with stretchy dark energy attacks for thinning out the crowds. He and Ryu will fight a range of demonic fiends together with the suited enforcers of the Divine Dragon Order. While Yukumo is well-equipped to fight hordes, there will be plenty of 1v1s. Bosses include a gleefully laughing fox lady who doesn't get to laugh for very long in the footage.
</p><p>
Again, it's out on PC later this year, and will be coming to Game Pass. Team Ninja + Platinum is very much one of those "would you like some chocolate with your chocolate" combinations. I'm jumping the gun wildly, but I can't see this being a disappointment.

<p>Ubisoft has released an update on the state of play with Rainbow Six Siege’s anti-cheat mechanics. In a release published on social media, the team revealed that things are getting tougher for the cheaters and malicious operators who want to spoil everyone else’s fun in the tactical FPS.</p>



<p>Most of the changes are live now and are being witnessed first-hand by streamers and pro players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-stricter">Getting Stricter</h2>



<p>In the recent update from Ubisoft, it was explained that three major changes are being made to Rainbow Six Siege’s anti-cheat mechanics:</p>



<p><strong>Botting: Permanent Ban on First Offence</strong></p>



<p>‘We’ve heard your feedback and are updating our sanctioning systems for players detected for botting. Players will now be permanently banned on their first botting offense, rather than an initial 15-day ban followed by a permanent ban on the second offense. This stricter and more aggressive sanctioning has been made possible by an improved detection system that drastically reduces false positives.’</p>



<p><strong>Cheater Match Cancellation and Live Kick</strong></p>



<p>‘As of now, cheaters sanctioned by our systems will be kicked from their ongoing match and the match will be automatically cancelled.’</p>



<p>This was captured first-hand by a popular streamer:</p>



<div><article><p><span>So it turns out </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Rainbow6Game</a><span> is not messing around. It kicks the cheater and instantly cancels the match. No elo is taken from anyone and rollback commences for all who queued with the cheater that season. 

This is an unbelievable development and I am SO hype.</span></p></article></div>







<p><strong>Encryption: Binary Hardening and Security</strong></p>



<p>‘Along with Y9S4.2, we are shipping a new round of hardening and security updates, as we did in each patch (4.0, 4.1, 4.1.1) with major disruption and impact on the most prevalent cheat providers.’</p>



<p>Do you think these changes are a win, or are they likely to backfire on honest, legitimate players? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>South of Midnight finally has a release date. During its 2025 Xbox Developer Direct on Thursday, developer Compulsion Games revealed that the game will launch on April 8.</p>



<p>When it launches, South of Midnight will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PC, and via Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>South of Midnight comes from the developers of We Happy Few, and takes players to the deep south of the United States. The game sees you play Hazel who becomes a Weaver after a storm hits her home of Prospero. According to Compulsion Games, a Weaver is a “magical mender of broken bonds and spirits”.</p>



<p>“Imbued with these new abilities, Hazel will confront and subdue dangerous creatures, untangle the webs of her own family’s shared past and -if she’s lucky – find her way to a place that feels like home,” the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>South of Midnight is Compulsion Games’ first release under the Xbox Game Studios umbrella. The studio had been independent before it was purchased by Xbox in 2018. The game itself was first announced in June 2023 before getting its first gameplay trailer in June 2024. That’s when the 2025 release window was also confirmed before getting a firm release date during the Developer Direct.</p>



<p>“At Compulsion Games, we love to craft around central themes,” game director Jasmin Roy said. “We’re lucky to have talent across all our disciplines that collaborate to give South of Midnight such a unique personality.”</p>



<p>In addition to a release date, Compulsion Games released the story trailer, giving players a deeper look at what they can expected when loading into South of Midnight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the first details below.</p><div><p><strong>A New <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> World Unveiled</strong></p><p>While the series has been beloved for almost four decades, the announcement of <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em> marks the first new mainline entry in 13 years. When asked about the long gap—spanning two Xbox console generations—Yasuda expressed Team NINJA’s long-standing desire to bring the series back. “Fans have long been asking us for a new <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> game,” he said. “<a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,043 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a>‘s President, Hisashi Koinuma, and PlatinumGames’ CEO, Atsushi Inaba, share a close relationship, which led us to explore a collaborative development effort. PlatinumGames had the expertise we felt was ideal for working on <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em>, and with support from Microsoft’s Phil-san [Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming], the three companies were able to take the next step towards creating a brand-new NINJA GAIDEN.”</p><p>Appearing for the first time in the Developer_Direct broadcast, and published by Xbox Game Studios, <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em> is positioned as the direct sequel to <em>NINJA GAIDEN 3</em>. While maintaining the dark and gritty world that the series is known for, players will take on the role of a new protagonist, Yakumo. “A significant amount of time has passed since <em>NINJA GAIDEN 3</em>, and players will find themselves arriving in a gruesomely transformed Tokyo. One of the key themes of this story is the return of the Dark Dragon, which has plunged the city into chaos. Within these unsettling conditions, Yakumo will have to face off against his foes, as well as the formidable <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Ninja himself, Ryu Hayabusa,” Nakao explained.</p><p>When asked why a new protagonist was introduced, Nakao clarified that “since it’s been a while since the last game, we wanted a new hero to make the series more approachable for new players. Of course, we also wanted long-time fans to enjoy the game, so Ryu Hayabusa plays a significant role in the story, serving as a major challenge and growth milestone for Yakumo. Ryu will appear throughout the game and be playable, ensuring his prowess and presence is deeply felt in <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em>.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Overcoming Adversity in <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em></strong></p><p>In the Developer_Direct trailer, the new protagonist, Yakumo, shows off stylish new mechanics which include traversal using wires and rails, something new for a <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> title. When asked about the addition of these elements, Nakao revealed one of the game’s core themes: “Adversity is a key concept for this game. From the beginning to the end of each stage and even in the transitions between, everything is designed to represent adversity for Yakumo.” First and foremost, that adversity will come in the form of NINJA GAIDEN’s signature combat, but Nakao explains that these new additions outside of the fights keeps that feeling high at all times: “To maintain the tension throughout, we’ve added high-speed elements like rail and wire-based actions to keep up the sense of challenge.”</p><p>The announcement footage also depicted a rain-soaked, cyberpunk-like Tokyo, leaving a strong impression to those who watched the trailer. “In <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em>, we wanted to blend old and new elements. Tokyo in this game has been drastically transformed by the influence of the underworld., which is why it appears this way,” Nakao explained, elaborating on the Dark Dragon’s miasma rain, as well as the disasters it has caused. “Rain is a major visual theme in this game. For example, we’ve put a lot of effort into how characters look when drenched, how raindrops hit the ground, and various other effects.” These visual motifs stay true to the signature dark, hardcore atmosphere of the series while bringing new flavor to its visual direction.</p><p>Nakao also touched on the game’s anticipated difficulty. “We’ve brought together the best aspects of the series and elevated them for the current generation. <a title="Series > Persona [87 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lly, I believe [the difficulty level of] <em>NINJA GAIDEN 2</em> had a lot of standout qualities, and I think fans will feel its influence strongly throughout <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em>.”</p><p>After such a long break between games, it’s paramount that the team balances what’s great about the series, while adding new ideas. Despite the daunting challenges, the collaboration between Team NINJA and PlatinumGames promises an unparalleled <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> experience.</p><p>“One of the key differences between modern <a title="Genres > Action [2,436 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a> and <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> lies in the sense of fairness when confronting enemies,” Nakao said, explaining the series’ unique game balance philosophy. “Enemies are designed to be masters of defense and experts of unrelenting aggression, but players never feel they’re at an unfair disadvantage. There’s a sense of balance that’s been passed down through the series, transcending current-day trends.”</p><p>“The rapid shifts between offense and defense, the almost fighting game-like 1v1 combat—you’ll see these elements evolve in <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em>. At the same time, we’ve ensured that returning players will immediately feel at home when they pick up the game,” he concluded.</p><p><strong>A True <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [97 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>or</strong></p><p>When asked about the challenges involved in achieving the fairness that defines the <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> series, Nakao shared his thoughts with a laugh.</p><p>“If I were to go into detail about the feel of the action, we’d be here for quite a while (laughs). In all NINJA GAIDEN titles, a delicate balance is carefully crafted to maintain the satisfaction of attacking enemies without losing the speed and exhilaration that define the gameplay. I remember struggling with the fine adjustments required to achieve the right feel when we first started implementing and testing the systems. Additionally, when we brought Ryu Hayabusa into <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em>, we wanted long-time fans to experience the exact same enjoyable gameplay feel they’ve come to expect. We had numerous discussions with Team NINJA to fine-tune the mechanics and ensure everything felt just right.”</p><p>Yasuda also added that “when it comes to gameplay feel, Team NINJA was deeply involved. Fairness in combat with enemies is only possible when ultimate playability is a given. To achieve that, we pushed for even deeper refinement of controls and other aspects. I know it probably seemed like we were being a bit too demanding at times…(laughs).” This collaboration across company lines was crucial to creating the next ultimate <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> experience.</p><p>One of the standout features of <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em>, which embodies the series’ experience while introducing fresh elements, is Yakumo’s “Bloodraven Form.” Nakao described this as “a technique that manipulates the blood of oneself and enemies, transforming it into a massive weapon capable of slicing through multiple foes at once.” He elaborated further on how this addition expands upon the series’ traditional gameplay.</p><p>“Yakumo fights using Bloodraven Form, and when certain conditions are met, he can unleash a move called ‘Bloodbath Kill,’ which instantly bisects enemies in one strike.” Nakao explains that, while previous entries have tasked players with working out how to approach encounters with multiple enemies, and <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em> is introducing another exhilarating way to fight against swarming crowds: “This time we’ve added large-scale, high-damage attacks with the Bloodraven Form, enabling players to instantly turn the tide of battle in their favor.”</p><p>This system introduces moments of release from overwhelming situations, offering new depth to the gameplay that Nakao hopes both newcomers and returning fans will enjoy.</p><p>Both Team NINJA and PlatinumGames are known for their expertise in high-end action games. According to Nakao, the process of creating <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em> revealed the unique strengths and characteristics of each studio.</p><p>“Looking at the titles created by PlatinumGames, we noticed clear differences in approach. While we emphasize flashy, impactful strikes and moment-to-moment experiences, the <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> series focuses on delivering refined and satisfying gameplay feel, culminating in an exceptionally polished overall action experience. This collaboration was a truly unique learning opportunity for us at PlatinumGames.”</p><p>When asked about the significance of bringing <em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em> to Xbox, Yasuda reflected on Team NINJA’s long history with the platform.</p><p>“With titles like the <em>Dead or Alive</em> series and the <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> series—especially the original <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em>, <em>NINJA GAIDEN Black</em>, and <em>NINJA GAIDEN II</em>—we have a deep history with Xbox. It’s been a long time, but we’re thrilled to bring the latest installment back to Xbox players. Additionally, with the game being added to Game Pass, we’re excited that more people will have the opportunity to experience it.”</p><p>Nakao, who became a fan of the series during his days as a student, also shared his excitement. “Personally, I played <em>NINJA GAIDEN II</em>&nbsp;on <a title="Platforms > Xbox 360 [9,999 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-360">Xbox 360</a>, so being able to play the latest installment on Xbox again makes me very happy. Even now, I occasionally boot up <em>NINJA GAIDEN II</em>&nbsp;on my <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,595 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X</a>. As a developer and a fan, I’m thrilled to see the <em>NINJA GAIDEN</em> series come together on Xbox, creating a moment in time where all these titles can be enjoyed in one place.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During the Xbox Developer Direct January 2025, Koei Tecmo surprised-dropped Ninja Gaiden 2 Black for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. The game is also available on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>This is a remaster of the 2008 game and is described as the definitive way to play. "We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4," said producer Fumihiko Yasuda, in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with Xbox</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> NINJA GAIDEN 2 Black Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The "Black" moniker is to signify that this version of Ninja Gaiden 2 is the definitive way to play the game, similar to how the first Ninja Gaiden was remastered with the two additional Hurricane content packs.</p><p>The idea to remaster the game came from fan feedback during the release of the Ninja Gaiden Master Collection in 2021. Fans wanted an experience that was closer to the original Ninja Gaiden 2, so the developers sought to remaster it in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>"We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence," Yasuda explained. "We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release."</p><p>Ninja Gaiden has seen a huge resurgence as of late. At The Game Awards 2024, Koei Tecmo announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ninja-gaiden-game-on-the-way-from-blasphemous-devs/1100-6528432/" data-ref-id="1100-6528432">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, a 2D platformer by the Blasphemous developers. Now, Koei Temco announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-ninja-and-platinum-games-team-up-for-ninja-gaiden-4/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, the next mainline game in the series, along with a partnership with Platinum Games. It will launch this fall for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>While a direct sequel to 2012's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-3">Ninja Gaiden 3</a>, there's still a fresh protagonist here - Yakumo - to ease new players in, as well as a new, rain-soaked cyberpunk version of Tokyo to slice through, changed due to the growth of the series' underworld. 
</p>
<p>For long-term fans, master ninja Ryu Hayabusa will return and play a "significant role in the story", Team Ninja has said. Indeed, the character will even be playable at certain points.
</p>
<p>
"Fans have long been asking us for a new Ninja Gaiden game," Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda said. "Koei Tecmo's president, Hisashi Koinuma, and PlatinumGames' CEO, Atsushi Inaba, share a close relationship, which led us to explore a collaborative development effort.</p><p>"PlatinumGames had the expertise we felt was ideal for working on Ninja Gaiden," Yasuda continued, "and with support from Microsoft's Phil-san [<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a>, CEO of Microsoft Gaming], the three companies were able to take the next step towards creating a brand-new Ninja Gaiden."

<p>2025 marks Team Ninja's 30th anniversary, and thus the developer has dubbed this to be "The Year of the Ninja".

		<p>Having a made a name for themselves with the minimalist rally game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/26/art-of-rally-xbox-series-x-game-pass-summer-2021-kenya-update/">Art of Rally</a>, Funselektor is back with Over&nbsp;the Hill, a cosy looking off-road exploration game to play with your friends. The game is coming to Steam sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="over the hill - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFi39URiesI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sending you off through simultaneously serene and challenging minimalist environments, Over the Hill has you rambling through the world in a 4×4, whether playing solo or going with friends. There’s a day and night cycle and dynamic weather that will help to make the experience all the more immersive, while dealing with less than reliable trails, needing to link together to traverse fast-flowing rivers and more.&nbsp;The goal, in case you really need on, is discover portals that link the various environments together.</p>
<p>It all sounds a bit MudRunner to me, but without the harsh Soviet-era vehicles and perhaps not as treacherous with its terrain.</p>
<p>Funselektor founder Dune Casu said, “<em>After having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace. In a way, this game is similar to the experience I’ve had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There’s something special about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature and less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home</em>.”</p>

<p>Over the Hill is a collaboration between Funselektor and Strelka Games, who they partnered with for their racing management sim Golden Lap last year. It will be the fourth Funselektor game, all of which have been motor vehicle-based.</p>

        <p>"It's uneconomical and will cause us to lose a lot of money, [but] we feel like we have to break the logjam."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Epic Games has announced a fresh push to convince app developers to launch their games on the company's fledgling mobile store, which company boss Tim Sweeney has admitted will be costly.
</p>
<p>
The Epic Games Store for mobile will today add its first swathe of third-party games, beyond the company's core offering of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league-sideswipe">Rocket League Sideswipe</a>.
</p>
<p>
19 titles have made today's line-up on Android - including Bloons TD 6 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dungeon-of-the-endless">Dungeon of the Endless</a>: Apogee, which are the first titles to be offered in the store's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-bringing-free-games-to-its-mobile-store-in-a-bid-to-entice-new-users">previously-confirmed free games program</a>. 
</p>
<p>
16 of these will also be available via the Epic Games Store on iOS, where it is offered within the European Union. More will be added weekly, typically on Tuesdays.
</p>
<p>
Initially, Epic Games will offer free titles on a monthly basis, with its initial duo available until 20th February. A weekly schedule of free games will then kick in later this year. 
</p>

<p>
Epic Games has clearly found it difficult to tempt mobile developers to its storefront, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">originally set to welcome third-party games last year and reach 100m installs by the end of 2024</a> - something it fell short of, only reaching around 30m instead. 
</p>
<p>
The company admits that none of the 100 highest-grossing app developers are yet willing to also distribute their game on the storefront - something it blames on Apple's controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) policy.
</p>
<h2>Epic to pay developers to counter Apple's "insidious design"</h2>
<p>
What is the CTF policy? In a nutshell, iOS developers who want to launch games outside Apple's official App Store must pay a €0.50 fee for every install of its games - even via the App Store itself - after the company's first 1m installs.  It's a policy Epic Games and others have criticised as prohibitive of any real competition for the App Store, as no major app developer will want to penalise itself for launching elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Today, Epic Games has announced it will cover the CTF for games that are offered as part of its store's free games program, for the program's first 12 months. 
</p>
<p>
"It's uneconomical and will cause us to lose a lot of money, [but] we feel like we have to break the logjam there," Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said in a roundtable interview attended by Eurogamer. "[The CTF] is an absolutely insidious design, deviously constructed and deviously defended, and its the most critical thing the European regulators will need to overturn."
</p>
<blockquote>"We might run into serious financial problems after a couple more decades of this"</blockquote>
<p>
Asked whether Epic Games had the financial clout to continue the fight long-term, Sweeney said the company was in it for the long-haul.
</p>
<p>
"We might run into serious financial problems after a couple more decades of this, but we're determined to fight this out," he said. "I expect large parts of this struggle will go on over the rest of decade, and we're fully committed to it and breaking through. 
</p><p>
"The word for spending more money than you're making intentionally when you have a great business underneath is investment, and that's is what we see this as. It's an investment in Epic's future, both our future developer as a game developer ourselves - we see a much greater opportunity for Fortnite's future if iOS is open, and competition is allowed on iOS and Android, but we also see opportunities for all developers, and because we have businesses serving all developers such as Unreal Engine and Epic Games Store and our online services."
</p>
<h2>Apple and Google's "paywall" sees money going to "fuck all"</h2>
<p>
Either you have an ability to freely do business using fair market policies, or you're stuck behind Apple and Google's "paywall", Sweeney continued.
</p>
<p>
"Most of the profit your business produces will go to Apple and Google, who'll use it for fuck all - share buybacks and dividends rather than investment in hiring or technology or making the world a better place."
</p>
<p>
This includes Fortnite's big rival Roblox, which pays huge amounts to Apple and Google - something Sweeney says was "frustrating" and "sad" to see. 
</p>
<p>
In response to a question from Eurogamer on Epic Game Store's 30m installs to date, Sweeney said the company could have hit its 100m target if Apple and Google's "friction" had not gotten in the way.
</p>
<blockquote>"We could have had 60m users, we were denied that, and we're pissed"</blockquote>
<p>
"30m installs would obviously have been 60m if 50 percent of users hadn't been scared away by the scare screens and friction that Apple and Google uses," Sweeney said. "We could have had 60m users, we were denied that, and we're pissed. 
</p>
<p>
"But it's not just 60m, because there are network effects. If a number of users are in an ecosystem there's incentive for their friends to come in and interact with their friends. If we'd have 60m users come in instead of 30, each of those would have brought friends, and if those friends hadn't dropped off at a 50 percent rate due to the scare screens, then we might have 100m. I think it would have been easy for us to get to 100m users."
</p>
<p>
"Apple and Google are making this really hard," Epic Game Store boss Steve Allison added.

"We had a goal of 100m installs of our first version of the store - with our first-party games - by the end of [last] year. We knew that was going to be a challenge, and where we ended up was around 30m. The friction is real and that number confirms that, absent this friction, we would have hit 100m by the end of the year.
</p><p>
"The Core Technology Fees on the iOS side and the rate of drop off on installs for the store are issues for some of these companies and they have got to get better before we get them to join," Allison continued. "But regardless, many of them will join us and some will wait before we make progress in these areas, and we're working really hard to do that."
</p>
<p>
Allison said Epic Games is not yet ready to share its new targets, but wanted to see the results of the free games program before discussing more.

<h2>CMA investigation</h2>
<p>
The timing of today's announcement is interesting, coming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-set-to-pile-pressure-on-apple-and-google-app-store-dominance-as-fresh-investigation-launched">hot on the heels of this morning's confirmation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that it is launching a fresh investigation into Apple and Google</a> using last year's  Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games first launched the mobile version of its store last year, as the latest salvo in its long-running battle against Apple and Google which it says hold an unfair monopoly over the distribution of apps and games within their own ecosystems. 
</p><p>
The CMA will now investigate whether either Apple or Google should be labelled as having Strategic Market Status, a designation that would allow the authority to "guide the behaviour" of each firm, "tackling conduct that could undermine fair competition, or exploit people and businesses".
</p>
<p>
Lastly, today also brings a couple of new features to the Epic Games Store on mobile, including Epic Account login and an auto-update feature.

            <p>
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad is stepping down after 12 years in the role, with his departure following a rocky period for Warner's game division that's been marked by a number of high-profile flops.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://x.com/Variety/status/1882452431146991914">reported by Variety</a>, Haddad will stay on with the company for the next three months, while Warner seeks his replacement. "David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter," Warner's global streaming and games president JB Perrette wrote, "which will help minimise disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title."
</p>
<p>
News of Haddad's departure comes almost exactly a year after the disastrous release of developer Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, which was enough of a flop to that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">resulted in a $200m loss</a> for Warner Bros. Free-to-play platform fighter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> also failed to find an audience despite almost a year of downtime for extensive retooling, resulting in a further $100m hit for the publisher.

<p>
And while 2023's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> was a significant financial win for Warner Bros., last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions failed to replicate that success, with the publisher later admitting the title had "underperformed".
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>, the publisher has yet to share much in the way of its future plans. The only game currently left on its announced slate is Monolith Productions' open-world Wonder Woman title - which Warner Bros. has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-is-not-being-designed-as-a-live-service-game">denied is a live service title</a>, despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-job-listing-suggests-itll-be-a-live-service-game">job listing sighted in 2023</a>, and despite company CEO David Zaslav's previous ambitions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-says-it-plans-to-transform-its-biggest-franchises-into-live-service-games">transform its biggest gaming franchises</a> from traditional console and PC releases into "always on" live service games.
