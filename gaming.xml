		<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed to next year, Ubisoft has confirmed in a statement to investors, setting a new date for 14th February 2025.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of a sweetener to get people to pre-order <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, though, as buyers will all receive the first expansion for free, instead of having to buy into the Season Pass.</p>


<p>The delay follows on from an abrupt cancellation of Ubisoft’s Tokyo Game Show plans, and with the company under a bit of a cloud following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>“While the game is feature complete,” Ubisoft says, “the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title. This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles.”</p>
<p>CEO Yves Guillemot elaborated, “Our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly, with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands.”</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure that a February launch is going to help them here. Assassin’s Creed Shadows will now be going up against <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed</a> just days on either side, and both of which had shifted from their own late 2024 release plans – Avowed specifically trying to avoid other big game launches, too.</p>
<p>It also feels like this is perhaps the seventh time in as many years that Ubisoft has recommitted itself to being more player-centric and meeting expectations better, so it’s not entirely clear how this will play out any differently. Taking more time to polish a game is still a positive, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows has potential to be a very popular game, thanks to the long-awaited Japanese setting. That said, the game has had a strange public perception ever since it was announced, thanks in no small part to featuring a black immigrant samurai as one of the two playable characters – something that Ubisoft has at times struggled to communicate well with fans and gamers around the world.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-pulls-out-of-tokyo-game-show-cancels-press-previews-of-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> were true: Ubisoft has just <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows to February 14, 2025. The reason to do so was the softer-than-expected performance of Star Wars Outlaws, which contributed to a disappointing financial result in Ubisoft's second quarter (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the stock price crash from a couple of weeks ago</a>).</p>
<p>Ubisoft aims to polish the game even further to avoid a similar issue, hence the delay. Furthermore, Assassin's Creed Shadows is abandoning the Season Pass model; the game will launch for everyone on the same day (instead of the early access launch of the more expensive editions), and pre-orders will enjoy the first expansion for free. Lastly, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be available on Steam on day one, marking a return to Valve's platform after Ubisoft had tried to sell its games via Ubisoft Connect and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will be the first game to make the jump. It is due to launch on Steam on November 21, and Ubisoft Massive is said to be at work on a series of updates to improve the player's experience and position the game as a 'long-term performer'.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO and Co-Founder Yves Guillemot commented on the Assassin's Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws news with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly, with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands.</em><br>
<em>Although the tangible benefits of the Company’s transformation are taking longer than anticipated to materialize, we keep on our strategy, focusing on two key verticals – Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences – with the objective to drive growth, recurrence and robust free cash flow generation in our business.</em></p>
<p><em>In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while delighting players. As a result, beyond the first important short-term actions undertaken, the Executive Committee, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, is launching a review aimed at further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately. I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows now joins an already super-cramped February that includes Civilization VII and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 11, Avowed and the first episode of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage on February 18, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii and Monster Hunter Wilds on February 28.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-february-next-year.991980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced an&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>delay, with the open-world action-RPG now set to launch early next year instead of on its originally intended November release date.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ubisoft says that while the game is a "dream project", it needs more time to "polish and refine the experience" and push "some of our key features" further. As such, the game will now launch on February 14th.</p>
<p>It's not all bad news, though;&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will now officially launch on Steam on day one, along with the other platforms on which it's arriving, so if you don't feel like using Ubisoft Connect, you no longer have to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-yasuke.jpg?itok=O1pL_vzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-yasuke.jpg?itok=JAGIxzbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time to cook, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' delay comes alongside an announcement that Ubisoft is <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updating its financial targets</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In its statement, Ubisoft admits that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' initial sales were "softer than expected", and that a series of updates to "polish and improve the player experience" are in the works.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will land on Steam on November 21st, and going forward, all of Ubisoft's PC games will, it seems, launch on Steam on day one. Presumably, you'll also be able to play them on Ubisoft Connect if you really want to.</p>
<p>Ubisoft head Yves Guillemot (the man <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">some investors want rid of</a>) says Ubisoft's second quarter performance "fell short of our expectations", and that the benefits of the company's "transformation" are taking "longer than anticipated to materialize".</p>

<p>As part of that statement, Ubisoft also says it's "departing from the traditional Season Pass model", and that everyone who pre-orders&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will be able to enjoy its first expansion for free as well.</p>
<p>It might be tempting to chalk&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' delay up to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy">ongoing backlash</a> from some sections of the gaming community, but that doesn't seem to be the case; Ubisoft doesn't mention the controversy at all in its delay announcement.</p>
<p>Additionally, in response to what he calls "polarized comments about Ubisoft", Guillemot says the studio is an "entertainment-first company" and that it doesn't intend to "push any specific agenda".</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-shadows/9N9P758CH65M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 14th.

Just make sure to time Mualani’s attacks to come after the enemy is on fire for that extra damage.</p><p><strong>To further assist Xianling, I of course have to recommend Bennett.</strong> He’s commonly partnered with her since she can make excellent use of his ATK buffs and energy generation. Although he won’t directly benefit Mualani much, he’s worth a spot on a team just to help Xianling cast her elemental burst more often.</p><p>There’s nothing wrong with adding even more damage with the right support. <strong>My top recommendations to accomplish this task are Kazuha or Emilie.</strong> Kazuha can pull in enemies close and then use attacks that absorb different elements. Emilie is most suited for using her Dendro element with Pyro for Burning reactions, pairing well with Xianling before Mulani comes in with her attack.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237"><em>Genshin Impact</em> Finally Hitting Xbox In November But Still No Nintendo Switch Port In Sight</a></span></p><p>Adding another character from the Natlan region is also worth your consideration.

Those that boost the HP will be a priority since so much of her damage scales off that stat. Any buffs to normal attack DMG will be helpful too since her skill’s attack do count as normal attacks.</p><p><strong>Surf’s Up is a 5-star weapon available on the Epitome Invocation banner alongside Mualani.</strong> Unsurprisingly, this unique item that perfectly fits her kit is the best option. It increases the user’s max HP by a considerable amount, in addition to providing Scorching Summer stacks that increase normal attack DMG. More of these stacks can be accumulated if you can trigger Vaporize reactions.</p><p><strong>If you want to use something more accessible, Ring of Yaxche is a great free-to-play pick.</strong> Triggered by activating an elemental skill, it increases normal attack DMG by 0.6 percent for every 1,000 HP the user has. All you need to do is visit a blacksmith in Natlan to craft this weapon.</p><h2 id="h5366"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Talents to level up</strong></h2><p>Of the two Natlan characters released so far, there’s a common focus on relying on their skill for traversal and combat. Mualani’s normal attack stats are only being factored in when she’s on her feet, and we want her on the Sharky Surfboard as often as possible. Here’s the order you should prioritize upgrading:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Elemental Skill - Surfshark Wavebreaker</li><li>Elemental Burst - Boomsharka-laka</li><li>Normal Attack - Cooling Treatment</li></ul><h2 id="h5367"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Artifact Sets for Mualani</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-recommend-id="image://5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-recommend-id="image://5a4d314cf8db5b10f0b9afd6a30c66bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, we come to the choices for Artifacts. Hydro DMG and HP buffs should naturally be top of mind, but the most optimal set is something different.</p><p><strong>Obsidian Codex is a brand-new artifact set and it is perfect for Mualani.</strong> The two-piece effect will increase her DMG by 15 percent whenever she uses her skill and activates Nightsoul’s Blessing mechanic. The four-piece will meanwhile increase CRIT Rate by 40 percent when a Nightsoul point is consumed. It can be earned by completing the Sanctum of Rainbow Spirits Domain of Blessing.</p><p><strong>The next full set worth considering is Heart of Depth.</strong> The two-piece increases Hydro DMG by 15 percent while the four-piece increases Normal and Charged attack DMG by 30 percent for a limited time after using a skill. This set can be earned by completing the Peak of Vindagnyr domain in Mondstadt.</p><p><strong>Building off on the idea of buffing normals, Martial Artist can be very effective on Mualani.</strong> The two-piece increases normal and charged attack DMG by 15 percent. The four-piece works similarly to the previous set, granting a 25 percent increase to DMG for a limited time after using a skill. This set will also require you to work through an Artifact domain, specifically The Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula in Liyue.</p><hr><p>Mualani is the first 5-star character from <em>Genshin Impact</em>’s new Natlan region and a great DPS to boot. Even without the unique Nightsoul’s Blessing mechanics, the damage she can do with the Vaporize reaction is incredible. If you want someone who’s formidable in combat and has fun traversal, Mualani is worth pulling for.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has officially confirmed that Star Wars Outlaws underperformed internal expectations. The revelation came via a financial targets update from the company on Wedenesday.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release and subsequent conference call</a>, Ubisoft said that the game’s release was “softer than expected”.

<p>“Additionally, despite solid ratings (Metacritic 76) and user scores across the First Party and Epic stores (3.9/5) that reflect an immersive and authentic Star Wars universe, Star Wars Outlaws initial sales proved softer than expected,” Ubisoft said. </p>

<p>Ubisoft has delayed the release date of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to February 14, 2025. According to statement released on social media, the developers need more time to polish and refine the experience. Additionally, players who pre-ordered the game will receive a refund, and future pre-orders will receive the first expansion for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news comes just a day after Insider Gaming first reported that press previews for Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-previews-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been cancelled</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Here’s Marc-Alexis Côté’s statement on behalf of the teams working on Assassin’s Creed Shadows: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a dream project for us; finally bringing the series to Feudal Japan with many features developed with our community in mind, such as parkour or the renewed stealth, brought by new technology, all set in a beautiful and immersive world.</p>



<p>This is an ambitious addition to the franchise, a rich experience that can be lived through the eyes of two unique protagonists – but we realize we need more time to polish and refine the experience, pushing further some of our key features.</p>



<p>As such, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release date to February 14, 2025. The game will release on a broad range of platforms, including Steam at launch. Additionally, preorders will be refunded and all future preorders will be granted the first expansion for free.</p>



<p>We understand this decision will come as disappointing news, especially to those who’ve been waiting patiently for an Assassin’s Creed game inspired by Feudal Japan, but we sincerely believe this is in the best interest of the game, and ultimately your experience as a player. Rest assured we are looking forward to the moment you will embark on a memorable adventure with Naoe and Yasuke.</p>



<p>Until then, we thank you for your ongoing support</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players should know that it also comes after Ubisoft their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cancels-online-appearance-at-tokyo-game-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online appearance at Tokyo Game Show 2024</a>.

PlayStation designer Toshi Aoki said in a new interview that the price is justified in part because it's not aimed at everyone.</p><p>"Well, it is for the enthusiasts, the most engaged players," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-time-with-the-ps5-pro-reaffirmed-i-shouldnt-spend-700-right-now-my-base-ps5-is-still-enough/1100-6526684/" data-ref-id="1100-6526684">Aoki told GameSpot</a>. "Which could be our initial early adopters who purchased the PS5. Also, people who have not come yet, maybe on other devices, but would want to play on the big-screen TVs. Have that capability on the console now that would shift over. We're not targeting just like the current PS5 owners, that's not it. It's more for the game enthusiasts who want to have that gameplay experience, which could be new users as well."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The PS5 Pro Surprised Us In Our Hands-On</p>
      </div>
<p>Aoki told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-ps5-pro-toshi-aoki-specs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the PS5 Pro's technological differences, the 2 TB SSD, the Wi-Fi 7 improvements, and the "new technologies that surround the gameplay" justify the hefty price tag. In Australia, the PS5 Pro starts at $1,200 AUD.</p><p>"So it's more of a full package that will give that exceptional value to the players... the most engaged players that we're targeting," Aoki said.</p><p>As for the choice to make the PS5 Pro a disc-free console and offer a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">disc drive as an option purchase for $80 USD</a>, Aoki said it came down to "giving players choices."</p><p>"We believe as a full package that it offers for the most players," he said. "For the disc drive, it is an option for players. Not all players have discs, even though most players may...but we have the option for being able to add that for those players. So I think it's more of the balance of the value proposition that we're giving."</p><p>Analyst Mat Piscatella believes the PS5 Pro price point is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-who-is-the-ps5-pro-for/1100-6526452/" data-ref-id="1100-6526452">not an issue for the enthusiast audience</a>, and that the market for the PS5 Pro is only a "very small portion" of the total PlayStation fanbase.</p><p>PS5 Pro preorders go live on Thursday, September 26. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">PS5 Pro preorder guide.</a></p><p>GameSpot went hands-on with the PS5 Pro, and editor Jordan Ramee said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-time-with-the-ps5-pro-reaffirmed-i-shouldnt-spend-700-right-now-my-base-ps5-is-still-enough/1100-6526684/" data-ref-id="1100-6526684">he wasn't immediately convinced to upgrade</a>.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a> was not the success that it hoped it would be. The company said the game's initial sales "proved softer than expected." Ubisoft did not, however, provide a specific sales figure for the game or reveal what its targets were in the first place.</p><p>In response to the lower-than-expected sales and player feedback, Ubisoft said its teams are now "fully mobilized to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience" ahead of the holidays. Ubisoft said it hopes Star Wars Outlaws can be a "strong long-term performer."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars Outlaws Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Additionally, Ubisoft confirmed that Star Wars Outlaws will come to Steam on November 21. In fact, Ubisoft mentioned that it is returning to launching its new games across the board on Steam, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-explains-why-it-doesnt-release-games-on-st/1100-6469502/" data-ref-id="1100-6469502">criticizing Steam's business model for years.</a></p><p>The poor performance of Star Wars Outlaws contributed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">Ubisoft's stock price recently sinking to a 10-year low.</a> Ubisoft has already addressed some of the Star Wars Outlaws issues, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-early-instant-fail-missions-were-a-mistake-dev-admits/1100-6526350/" data-ref-id="1100-6526350">changes for the game's divisive instant-fail missions.</a></p><p>Ubisoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows to February 2025</a>. Additionally, the company ditched plans for Shadows to have a season pass model and confirmed that Shadows will be available on Steam at launch.</p><p>Ubisoft also noted that it held a meeting with its board of directors recently and concluded that it needed to reduce its earnings forecast for the fiscal year, due in part to Outlaws coming up short and the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p>Ubisoft will share more details on its earnings results on October 30 when it next reports financial results. The company also signaled some changes on the horizon, saying it is "launching a review" with the aim of "improving our execution" and specifically what Ubisoft called a "player-centric approach."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/shadow-of-the-ninja-reborn-tengo-project-is-a-miracle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people have directors they follow obsessively. When it comes to niche retro remakes, I follow Tengo Project. The three previous games that Tengo released – <em>Wild Guns Reloaded</em>, <em>Ninja Saviors Return of the Warriors </em>and <em>Pocky and Rocky Reshrined</em> –<em> </em>have all been on my game of the year list in their respective years. They are all brilliant, brutal but fair retro games that are remakes, at least on paper. The most recent, <em>Shadow of The Ninja - Reborn </em>is some of their best work, taking the idea of a remake and elevating it to an entirely new level. What Tengo Project does is singular and special, and I am so happy that they are allowed to flourish.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SNES vs Switch (The Ninja Warriors / The Ninja Saviors) Side by Side Comparison" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H0LWE5aQZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A side-by-side comparison of The Ninja Warriors and The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors.</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you have not heard of Tengo Project, it’s because they are not terribly big or flashy. Tengo Project is a small development team of industry veterans inside Natsume Atari, basically three guys whose work goes back to the 90s. Their three previous titles were all remasters of games that they themselves had originally worked on in the Super Famicom era. <em>Wild Guns Reloaded </em>(a total remaster of the 1994 SNES game <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Guns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wild Guns</em></a>) was an arcade style steampunk cowboy game featuring redrawn pixel art, with two new characters and four-player co-op. The added characters, a beefy bomb-throwing woman named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKBBJBLEcAs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doris</a> and a dachshund named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIMq2eYCnhY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bullet</a> that is friends with a robot, are not only fun but add totally completely different ways to play the game. Tengo followed this up with the even more impressive <em>The</em> <em>Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors, </em>a total remake of a Super Famicom beat 'em up, itself a spinoff of a 1987 Taito arcade game. Tengo also remade the game from the ground up, adding two characters, one of which is a boss-sized character that takes up most of the screen. They followed this with <em>Pocky and Rocky Reshrined </em>a gut renovation of a beloved scrolling shooter where you play a shrine maiden and a tanuki.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DF Retro EX: Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined Review - The Retro Remake Redefined!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dNUaXjwA3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Digital Foundry’s Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined Review. They get it.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><p>The main people I know who are diehard fans of what Tengo does are often retro gaming fans like me. These people are either young and weird with niche obsessions, or 30 or 40 years old masochists who love spending an hour memorizing a platforming sequence. These are the kind of people who know <em>Contra: Hard Corps </em>inside and out. Every one of them either <a href="https://aftermath.site/mister-pi-de-10-nano-clone-board-taki-udon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owns a MiSTer</a> or has plans to in the near future. If you were forced to share a health bar in a co-op game, like you do in <em>Shadow of the Ninja</em>, you would trust them implicitly. They can recognize the fighting game levels of refinement and complexity that Tengo puts into their work. If “difficult but fair” describes your ideal game, then you are at home here.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NES Longplay [092] Shadow of the Ninja" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYzg8TO2WLk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Longplay of the original <em>Shadow of the Ninja: Reborn.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Though <em>Shadow of the Ninja</em> -<em> Reborn </em>is an enhanced remake like Tengo’s previous games, it is their most radical and ambitious one to date. Part of this is due to how wildly different the source game is: the original <em>Shadow of the Ninja </em>(also known as <em>The Dark Operative: Kage</em> in Japan and <em>Blue Shadow</em> in Europe and Australia) was a fairly lean but difficult Famicom hack and slash platformer. <em>Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn </em>takes the original’s loose skeleton and transforms it into a Super Famicom era game. Calling this a remake undersells the sheer scale of what is being done here; this is functionally a new game. What Tengo have done is akin to remaking the original <em>Megaman</em> in the style and gameplay of <em>Megaman X</em> with an arranged soundtrack in 2024.</p><figure><figcaption>Look at how lush that city looks. This is <em>Osman-tier</em>. Credit: ININ Games.</figcaption></figure><p>The setting and overall design of <em>Shadow of The Ninja</em> has been overhauled. The original was set in America in the year 2029, which they were going to have to change anyway given how the skyline of New York City has changed since 1991. Instead of the Big Apple, the setting is the megacity of Laurasia. As with the original, there is an evil emperor by the name of Garuda, and you play one of two ninjas, Hayate and Kaede, on a mission to restore peace. The revamped design of both <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1828934773143904746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the characters</a> and setting is in keeping with the 16 bit cybernetic aesthetic of many of Tengo Project’s previous releases. The entire game looks like something I would think is cool when I was seven and try to draw on the margins of a notebook.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Beyond the Shadows: Shadow of the Ninja — Reborn! (Documentary)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5XF-KtpOQcA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>ININ produced a promotional mini-documentary about Tengo Project.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><p>Though levels and enemies are similar to their NES counterparts, they have been so aggressively reworked as to make them almost entirely new. The katana and the whiplike kusarigama are now both permanent weapons instead of items that are switched out <em>Castlevania </em>style, and both have their own situational pros and cons. The item drop system itself has been expanded to include robust tools like flamethrowers and wall-climbing robots, and includes an inventory system that allows you to swap those items out on the fly. There is also a “pocket money” system that allows the player to fill up their inventory with items in time attack mode. The game also revamps how energy and the ninjutsu attack work in a way that dovetails into katana and health use.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Adding slight complexities to a previously simple game. Not knowing how these work can add some frustration. The Hover and Wall Run are worth mastering early.</figcaption></figure><p>On top of all that, movement has changed significantly. While the previous game emphasized hanging on platforms and overhangs, the remake adds completely new ways to move, like the ability to balance on the katana’s tsuba following a down attack, more directionality to the kusarigama, a <em>Symphony of the Night</em> style dash, wall running, and a brief mid-air spin that slightly extends the duration of a jump when performed. All of these are complex but marginal enough to not break the game, and many are required for getting to some of the game’s more complicated secrets and platforming segments. While many loyalists of the original may not like these changes, the truth is that simply updating the original would not have been particularly interesting, and what Tengo has done is made this game uniquely their own work.</p><figure><figcaption>"I'm gonna say it again, LUSH!" Credit: ININ Games</figcaption></figure><p>What struck me the most while playing <em>Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn</em> is the art. Outside my favorite arcade game <em>Osman (</em>AKA <em>Cannon Dancer)</em>, I have seen few games in the 16 bit style that look this lush and complex. This is made more impressive by the fact that the art is the work of one person, <a href="https://x.com/mossmouth/status/1832277749932896332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shunichi Taniguchi</a>. His ability to render gargantuan machines is second to none. The sheer complexity on display in this pixel art is mind-boggling, and speaks to someone who has been at this for ages (you may have also be familiar with his work on the <em>Power Rangers </em>fighting game, the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Kid%C5%8D_Senki_Gundam_Wing:_Endless_Duel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><em>Shin Kidō Senki</em></em> G<em>undam Wing: Endless Duel</em></a>, and of course the original <em>Shadow of the Ninja</em>). This efficiency is extended to the whole team, given just how short the credits are compared to how beautiful and polished this game is. In addition to this, Iku Mizutani returned to perform the soundtrack himself.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Hilltop, a translator I follow, <a href="https://x.com/HilltopWorks/status/1787315035833835548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a good thread digging into Shunichi's work</a>. Credit: HilltopWorks.</figcaption></figure><p>This is what makes Tengo Project so singular. People online wring their hands constantly and throw trite little culture war fits about how “they don’t make ‘em like they used to”, but Tengo is not only doing that, it’s making them better. The games industry is brutal and unkind to the people who actually make the magic happen. Working conditions make people sick or injured or cause them to flee, seeking work with better pay and a healthier work-life balance. Skillsets are rendered niche or obsolete as technology advances. Game development is rarely a place to age with dignity, and to see people who made Super Famicom games continue to make Super Famicom games as though nothing had ever happened, with people who have decades-long relationships, makes me emotional in a way that I cannot articulate. That is a rare luxury. Perhaps I am being overly sentimental, but it is a miracle that Tengo Project is even allowed to do this, to go back and redo work, to refine their talents with age. They are out here, making games strictly for the freaks. I wish for so many others to get such an opportunity.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Bosses from the original game have been wildly reimagined. Credit: ININ Games.</figcaption></figure><p>In a promotional mini documentary ININ Games made for the remake, Tanaguchi-san reflects. “It was 35 years ago since I was part of the original project, so I think it’s quite rare, even looking around the gaming industry, to be able to recreate a new game based on the game that I worked on in the past. In that sense, it may be a cliché, but persistence is power.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Tengo Project.

<p>Several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-machine-god-update">updates</a> have already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-traitor-curse-update-celebrates-anniversary-with-new-content">released</a> for&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>since it launched all the way back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40000-darktide-release-date-pushed-back-once-again">in November 2022</a>, but this one looks to be significantly more ambitious than many of the shooter's previous content drops.</p>
<p>Part of Fatshark's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40000-darktide-2024-plans">ambitious roadmap</a> for&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>in 2024, the Unlocked and Loaded update's first (and, arguably, biggest) change is a total rework to how weapon progression and itemization work in&nbsp;the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-enemy.jpg?itok=WTGeOMnh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-enemy.jpg?itok=0CmUypik 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The latest&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>update is bringing big itemization changes.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new systems are being introduced in this update, namely Mastery and Power. Mastery allows players to gain experience in their weapon of choice, unlocking new rewards and perks as they use that weapon in missions.</p>
<p>Power, meanwhile, lets you spend resources at the Shrine of the Omnissiah in order to improve your weapon. This, in turn, lets you boost base stats, allowing weapons to reach their "maximum potential", according to Fatshark.</p>
<p>Unlocked and Loaded also introduces a brand new mission type in the form of Operations, which are intended to "provide a shorter and more cinematic experience". The first of these, Rolling Steel, sees you stopping a train hijacked by cultists.</p>
<p>Other new features in this update include a socially-oriented Party Finder to help you find like-minded&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>players, as well as a new time-limited special event, Unrelenting Hordes, that's running until October 10th.</p>

<p>The full list of changes in the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Unlocked and Loaded update is extensive; so extensive, in fact, that Fatshark has spread the changes across four pages in its patch notes, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361210/view/4653997209640960080" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can check out here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-darktide/9NT3WC6RKBVQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

The company elaborated more in a press release aimed at investors that cited “soft” sales from <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> as part of the reason for pushing the game back from its original November 11 launch. </p><p>“While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title,” it read. “This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles.”</p><p>In addition, Ubisoft is revising <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>’&nbsp;seasonal content plans. Instead of granting early access to players who purchase the more expensive Deluxe edition, all owners of the game will be able to play at the same time starting on February 14. In addition, anyone who pre-orders the game will get the first seasonal expansion for free rather than needing to purchase a separate upgrade to access it. </p><p>Rumblings of a potential delay began earlier this week when Ubisoft suddenly and unexpectedly pulled out of its planned Tokyo Game Show livestream. Then&nbsp;<em>Insider Gaming </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-previews-delayed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-previews-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a></span> that hands-on previews for the game had also been cancelled. Ubisoft’s stock hit a 10-year low this month as it searches for its next hit blockbuster. It seemed like<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em> would be that, but mixed reviews at launch and weak initial sales data pointed to an uphill struggle for the stealth-based open-world game. </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> has also faced its own manufactured controversy among certain corners of the internet over the fact that its male protagonist is a Black samurai. While Yasuke is a historical figure, and <em>Assassins’ Creed </em> is a fictional series that includes things like aliens, <em>Shadows</em> has nevertheless landed in the crosshairs of a cottage industry of gamer outrage, with figureheads making unsubstantiated claims that the move represents “forced” diversity in games. </p><p>While Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously denounced “hateful acts”</a></span> targeting <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and its development team, today he seemed to try to placate the game’s most bad-faith detractors. “I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda,” he said in a press release. “We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation’s new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/25/first-look-report-ps5-pro-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> discusses the latest performance and fidelity upgrades for PS5 Pro Enhanced games, including Horizon Forbidden West, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, GT7, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-arriving-on-november-7">PS5 Pro Enhanced Games Arriving on November 7</h2>



<p>Horizon Forbidden West and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will feature new Enhanced modes on November 7, the launch date of the PS5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizon Forbidden West’s Pro Performance mode will produce the same high frame rate as the stock PS5’s Performance mode while providing the fidelity of the stock Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth’s Enhanced Mode on the PS5 Pro will maintain a frame rate of 60FPS and leverage the power of PSSR to provide a resolution on par with the Graphics mode.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-other-ps5-pro-enhanced-games">Other PS5 Pro Enhanced Games</h2>



<p>The Last of Us Part 1 and 2 Remastered will also offer a new PS5 Pro-specific mode that will upscale 1440p to 4K via PSSR super-resolution while maintaining a stable 60fps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insomniac will provide PS5 Pro enhancements for all four games released on the PS5: Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Players will find a new Performance Pro Mode in these games, running the title at 60fps while providing 4K resolution and ray tracing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avalanche Studios uses the PS5 Pro to enhance the ray tracing quality for Hogwarts Legacy through a new Fidelity Ray Tracing Mode, which will be available at launch. The new mode will add raytraced shadows and enhance raytraced reflections while targeting a stable 30fps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GT7 will release a few new PS5 Pro-focused rendering modes in November, including a Raytrace Priority Mode that will add new car reflections. GT7 will also include an experimental 8K/60fps mode for “hyper-crisp, hyper-clean visuals.” Players will need a display that supports 8K to test this feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>F1 24 is another PS5 Pro-enhanced game that will upgrade its quality mode to introduce ray tracing effects, offering a more realistic and immersive experience on rain-soaked courses. Here’s <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ps5-pro-developers-share-how-theyre-using-new-tech-to-enhance-their-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how developers are using the new tech</a> for PS5 Pro Enhanced games.</p>

Readyverse also announced it's partnered with <a href="https://neotokyo.codes/what-is-neo-tokyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neo Tokyo</a> to bring its IP characters, called Citizens, to OPEN.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373060-screenshot2024-09-25at8.05.49am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373060" data-ratio="0.56051990251828" data-width="1231" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373060-screenshot2024-09-25at8.05.49am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373060"></a><figcaption>A new look at the world of OPEN</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373060-screenshot2024-09-25at8.05.49am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373306-screenshot2024-09-25at12.50.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373307-screenshot2024-09-25at12.50.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373306,1300-4373307" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373306-screenshot2024-09-25at12.50.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373307-screenshot2024-09-25at12.50.09pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373306-screenshot2024-09-25at12.50.02pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373307-screenshot2024-09-25at12.50.09pm.png"></figure><p>As announced previously, OPEN is modeled in part on Ready Player One, in that it will offer a virtual world filled with recognizable IP. Some of the partners that have been announced already include DeLorean, Reebok, and Cool Cats.</p><p>Readyverse co-founders Aaron McDonald, Shara Senderoff, Dan Farah, and Cline said in a joint statement that teaming up with Wētā allows the team to create content never before seen in gaming. "It's an honor to build our vision hand-in-hand with the best," the team said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIdV-YurOJM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JIdV-YurOJM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wētā's Richard Taylor said working with Readyverse has allowed it to "explore a visually stunning and incredibly immersive world unlike anything we have done before."</p><p>OPEN is in development now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It's a third-person battle royale game featuring environments inspired by media nostalgia. It will offer competitive and cooperative play modes, and aims to be a "defining" metaverse game that also incorporates web3 technology to allow for "asset interoperability and digital ownership."</p><p>Readyverse has not released any gameplay footage of OPEN as of yet, but keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>OPEN is in development at Walker Labs in partnership with Readyverse. People working on the game previously worked at studios like Epic, DICE, Microsoft, PlayStation, Remedy, EA, Ubisoft, and Lucasfilm.</p><p>"I was trying to imagine the coolest possible future version of the internet and video games and conflate it together," Cline said at SXSW this year, as reported by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/gaming-business/open-is-a-metaverse-experience-coming-from-ready-player-one-creators-readyverse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>. "And what the future would be like in 30 years. A ton of my experience was with the early days of the Internet, which felt like this new frontier. It was an egalitarian technology that everyone could use and have access to."</p><p>Readyverse isn't the only company attempting to create a so-called metaverse. Epic Games has been doing this for years through Fortnite, which features all manner of different licensed content from Metallica to Darth Vader and John Wick and Lego. Disney <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-it-invested-1-5-billion-into-fortnite-and-what-it-hopes-to-achieve/1100-6525584/" data-ref-id="1100-6525584">recently invested $1.5 billion into Epic to basically create Disney World inside Fortnite</a>.</p><p>"It's going to take on a life of its own and really quickly transcend what it is today. It's become very clear over the past few years that we're in this steep growth curve that's being driven by that," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-future-could-be-a-bigger-seamless-world-and-more-players/1100-6525024/" data-ref-id="1100-6525024">Sweeney said of Fortnite's metaverse ambitions</a>. "This medium is emerging at an astonishing rate, and I think people have no idea how awesome it's going to be by the end of this decade. But when you look at all the best capabilities of the top game engines, look at all the work being created for top movies in the film industry, all the work of all the car makers and of all the other storytellers and creators of all different kinds of games, and envision what the world is like when all of that comes together into a socially connected united economy which everybody can participate in, that's going to be a whole new world. And that's what we're very excited about."</p>

While the 168 million global subscriptions present a significant opportunity for broader reach and steady revenue, developers are treading carefully.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A July 2024 survey of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/om123391/game-developer-collective-survey-july-2024-trends-in-design-accessibility-and-inclusion">Game Developer Collective</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveals that while many developers are optimistic about including their games in subscription services, few are tailoring the design of their games specifically for these platforms. No doubt, the slowing uptake of game subscription services post-pandemic has been a key factor in this restrained approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is in contrast with the experience of other industries, such as music, where streaming services have had a significant impact on songwriting, with artists adapting to fit algorithms and playlists. The key difference is that music subscriptions account for over two-thirds of industry revenue, compared to less than 10% for games – meanwhile, game developers face a far more opaque payout model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the survey, 35% of game developers believe it’s likely that their current game will be added to one or more subscription services. However, when asked if subscription models have influenced the design of their current game, only 13% indicated that subscription services have had any impact on their development process. A striking 80% said these services had no influence at all. These numbers reveal a gap between interest in inclusion and active adaptation to the unique requirements of subscription platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Limited design adaptation points to industry hesitation about subscriptions</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Uncertainty about how subscription services will impact developers’ revenue models long-term is likely at the core of this cautiousness. The most successful subscription platforms, like Xbox Game Pass, often provide developers with lucrative upfront payments in exchange for including their games in the service. But for smaller titles or those without obvious blockbuster potential, the ambiguity around whether their games will be selected for a subscription service makes it hard to rely on subscriptions as a revenue stream.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games designed with subscription models in mind need to hook players quickly, as subscribers have access to a large library and can easily move on if they aren’t engaged early. A separate consumer survey conducted by Omdia found that four in ten subscribers try new games for only 30 minutes or fewer before deciding to commit. Yet, 80% of surveyed developers were reluctant to make substantial design changes, like front-loading exciting content right at the start of the game, that might favor these platforms (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>see chart above</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Opportunities offered by subscriptions remain alluring to developers</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the reluctance to change game design, the overall appeal of subscription services cannot be denied; 35% of developers expect their current game to be added to a subscription service (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>see the chart below below</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Developers recognize the potential to reach a broader audience, particularly through services like Xbox Game Pass, which boasts over 34 million of subscribers worldwide. For some developers, inclusion in these services provides exposure to players who may not have encountered their games otherwise. The lure of increased discoverability and the potential for long-tail revenue has led some studios to start exploring these platforms, even if they aren't overhauling their design strategies just yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, these benefits are tempered by the slow subscriber growth all platforms are experiencing. After the pandemic-induced surge in 2020 and 2021, subscriber growth has slowed significantly, and while steady growth is still expected in the years ahead, the massive consumer adoption some industry players envisioned remains distant. While subscriptions will generate $19.4bn in 2024, this will still make up just 8.8% of global games content revenue this year, according to Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/om124566/game-subscriptions-and-cloud-gaming-market-forecast-report-202428">latest report on the game subscriptions market</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But while subscriptions will not dominate the games market, they will complement a diverse range of monetization approaches. Therefore, the path forward will likely involve cautious experimentation – balancing the allure of subscription platforms with the economic realities of game development.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

Ubisoft has announced a dramatic delay to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will now launch on 14th February 2025 instead of its previously planned arrival this November. Existing pre-orders will be refunded. 
</p>
<p>
The publisher has always targeted the year's key holiday sales period for its Assassin's Creed blockbusters, making this move highly unusual. In a statement, Ubisoft said the game's content was complete - as you'd hope, seven weeks ahead of its intended launch date - but would now receive further polish.
</p>
<p>
Crucially, Ubisoft said the delay could be blamed on "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws", its previous big budget blockbuster for which it had high hopes, but then launched in August to lukewarm sales. The publisher was acting now, it said, based on "learnings" from that game.

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will now launch on Steam on day one - a move the publisher has indicated will continue with other releases going forward. </p>
<p>In another change, Shadows will now ditch the franchise's established season pass model. The game's first expansion will be granted free to anyone who pre-orders the game now, however.</p> <div>

<p>"While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide
additional time to further polish the title," Ubisoft said in a statement today. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles."
</p>
<p>Today's delay also marked Ubisoft's first comments on the performance of Star Wars Outlaws. The game received a "solid" critical response, it says, but this had not translated into sales. </p>
<p>"In response to player feedback, Ubisoft's development teams are currently fully mobilised to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the
holiday season to position Star Wars Outlaws as a strong long-term performer," the statement continued. "The game will be available on Steam on 21st November."</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote that the game's "stripped-back Ubisoft formula is admirable yet doomed" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws review</a> last month.</p>
<p>Rounding off today's news from Ubisoft was a statement from company boss Yves Guillemot, who admitted the firm's financial performance over the past quarter had been lower than expected, and announced a wider review of how future projects were executed. </p>
<p>"Our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly,
with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands," Guillemot said.</p>
<p>Without any further explanation, Guillemot concluded his comment by weighing in on what he called "polarised comments" about the company, which he said was "not to push any specific agenda". Here's the quote in full:</p>
<p>"Finally, let me address some of the polarised comments around Ubisoft lately. I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy."</p>
<p>It's hard not to read this as another comment on the recent controversy whipped up online around Assassin's Creed Shadows which has largely focused on the inclusion of African historical figure Yasuke and his portrayal as a samurai. Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for more clarity on Guillemot's comment here. </p>
<p>"Of course we're making creative choices, it's a video game," Assassin's Creed Shadows art director and franchise veteran Thierry Dansereau <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">told me last month</a>, adding that he was confident with how the game would ultimately be received.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/heart-electric-is-a-hero-shooter-from-a-dice-veteran-behind-battlefield-and-star-wars-battlefront<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
A veteran of Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront development has founded a fresh studio to launch Heart Electric, a new take on the hero shooter genre. 
</p>
<p>
Niklas Fegraeus, who served 15 years at DICE, announced the founding of Stockholm-based startup Modoyo last month. Now, the first gameplay footage of its debut project has also been revealed. 
</p>
<p>
Heart Electric - whose immediate look is bright and fun, if basic - hopes to stick a defibrillator to the embattled hero shooter genre, which recently saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">the failure of Concord</a> even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Valve's own effort Deadlock waits in the wings</a>.

<p>
How does it all work? Well, the idea is that each Heart Electric match begins with four teams of four heroes in their own base with a set amount of revives. You can go all out and simply take down opponents, which adds to your revive pool, or work more tactically to storm another team's base and steal their revives from them.
</p>
<p>
The idea is that with four small teams, the balance of gameplay can shift over the course of a match, and deciding who to target or work together with at a specific point is key. "Victory depends on reading the pulse of the battlefield," a press release states.
</p>
<p>
There's no firm release date yet, but you can sign up for a playtest now via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2392980/Heart_Electric/">Steam</a>.
