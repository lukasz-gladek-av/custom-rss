            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-gets-esrb-rating-suggesting-launch-might-be-near/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 had been rated by the ESRB. In that article, I predicted it would be released within six months, as most games rated by regulators do. Today, Paradox Interactive has unveiled that's exactly the timeframe they have in mind, as the long-awaited roleplaying game sequel is now scheduled to launch in October.</p>
<p>The message was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzc1Ow18qhY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> by Marco Behrmann, Executive Vice President of the World of Darkness IP (and Executive Producer on Bloodlines 2), who explained that the game is essentially done with only polishing left to do. Here's the full statement:</p>
<p><em>Since our last update, we have added more content to the game more narrative depth character development and we have also evolved Fabien's role in the storyline. Over the past couple of months we have invited you all to see the development of Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 in the form of <a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diaries</a> focusing on various areas from the game including the Camarilla, the Anarchs, the Hunters, and many many other things. I implore you to check it out, and learn more about the game. The status of the game right now is that the game is done.</em></p>
<p><em>We are currently focusing on bug fixing,&nbsp; stability and performance so that we can deliver the best experience to you guys once it releases. Bloodlines 2 will release in October this year.</em></p>
<p>It also looks like PC Gamer was the first publication to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-first-hands-on-a-gory-undead-power-fantasy-that-im-desperate-to-play-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get hands-on with a preview build of the game</a>, and their report is quite enthusiastic, minus some concerns, such as dialogue animations that need to be polished. They also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-have-typical-rpg-romantic-relationships-but-it-will-feature-romantic-feeding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers, revealing that the game would feature 'romantic feeding' rather than relationships, as confirmed by Creative Director Alex Skidmore:</p>
<p><em>So there are some romantic options. But vampire romance isn't the same as human romance. So we have—this is probably awful and I don't want to give this soundbite—a kind of romantic feeding. So there are points with named vampires where if you have played your card rights, you can do a romantic feed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A vampire's bite in VTM is called 'the kiss', so the humans don't scream, and they're left afterwards sort of dazed, and probably when they snap out of it they'll go, 'That was awesome. Where did that person go?' So that's the romanticism, whereas we didn't have that for the combat feeds. We want the combat feeds to be lethal, horrible.</em></p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-october-2025.1144344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed yet again. It's now set to come out later this year.</p>

<p>In a new development update trailer,&nbsp;<em>World of Darkness&nbsp;</em>executive VP Marco Behrmann reveals that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>won't be meeting its previously-announced release window; the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">set to come out in the first half of this year</a>.</p>

<p>However, the two aforementioned studios believe that "ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date", and so they've admitted that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>"will not be ready for release" before the fall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=Lzb2Q_8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=a7cfqcn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again. Who'd have thunk?</figcaption></figure><p>According to Behrmann, however, the game is "done", and The Chinese Room and Paradox are currently focusing on bug fixing and testing, placing&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>in a "late development stage".</p>

<p>The developer is apparently currently working to "ensure [<em>Bloodlines 2</em>] is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience", hopefully guaranteeing that the game "meets the technical quality standards that [fans] rightfully expect and deserve".</p>

<p>As such,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in October 2025, although Behrmann stopped short of announcing a new release date for the game. The wait goes on, it seems.</p>

<p>In case you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has a very long and arduous development history. The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-announced-mitsoda-returning-as-writer" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2019</a>, at which point original game writer Brian Mitsoda was set to return.</p>




<p>After numerous delays, Mitsoda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-kicks-out-narrative-designer-brian-mitsoda" rel="nofollow">removed from the project</a>, and its future was relatively uncertain until the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">returned in late 2023</a>, now being developed by <i>Dear Esther&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room.</p>

<p>We can only hope that this new release window for&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is accurate, but given the game's long and storied history, I will believe that when I see it. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Please, please, please keep an eye on Fortnite in the immediate future, as pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter appears to be heading to game soon. The breakout musical artist will seemingly be the next face in the massive roster of characters and real-life people to become playable Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-have-you-ever-tried-this-one">Have You Ever Tried This One?</h2>



<p>The Fortnite leakers are the first to report Sabrina’s seemingly imminent arrival. Multiple leakers have claimed that Sabrina Carpenter is likely the next to arrive, and the @FNBRintel account <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1903101976147095629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> last week that an inside source confirmed that the “next Fortnite Festival artist is female.”</p>



<p>Another Fortnite leaker, @ShiinaBR, posted today that some Sabrina-themed cosmetics have appeared in the game files already. This includes a glittery microphone with a heart-shaped base and a red, sequined heart-shaped sticker that she regularly uses.</p>



<div><article><p><span>SABRINA CARPENTER IS THE NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST 🔥

Fortnite accidentally added some of her cosmetics to the files earlier than intended! </span></p></article></div>



<p>Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, and The Weeknd have all been featured as the primary Icon in each season of Fortnite Festival. The rhythm game developed by Harmonix, developers of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, launched in Fortnite in December 2023. Each season features its own seasonal pass complete with songs, poses, and instruments related to the season’s Icon. Each Icon typically releases with playable outfits that can be used in various other games modes, like Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sabrina’s more risqué poses from her performances of “Juno” make it into the game remains to be seen. But a number of her most iconic songs should be playable in Fortnite Festival. Almost certainly, “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” will be featured, with one or both likely to be outfitted into an emote. The current Fortnite Festival season, featuring pop idol Hatsune Miku as the Icon, is scheduled to end on April 8th.</p>



<p>Will Sabrina’s arrival in Fortnite Mountain Dew it for you? Let us know down in the comments below! Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

In tandem with the launch, several pieces of free and paid DLC will be going live as well. A new hub will expand the hang-out potential for hunters, new armor and cosmetic pieces shake up the fashion game, and more fearsome monsters await on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've now got a date, details, and more for the next big update in Monster Hunter Wilds. What part of the update are you most looking forward to? Let us know down below!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">A New Hub For Hunters</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-14-1742912741311.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase started with a look at the new endgame hub for hunting parties. Dubbed the Grand Hub, there are plenty of new things to do in the area. Feast together, arm wrestle, or listen to the Diva sing at night. There's also a Barrel Bowling mini-game, which you can obtain vouchers for through various activities, and more rewards to be earned through it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Hub can be unlocked once you're Hunter Rank 16 by talking to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mizutsune Arrives</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-15-1742912686820.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As confirmed, the big addition for Title Update 1 is the bubbly monster Mizutsune. It's got swift tail strikes, water jets, and many other moves ready to burst your bubble when it arrives in Title Update 1. Once you've reached HR 21 or above, head to the Scarlet Forest and talk to Kanya for the quest. And of course, there's some new gear to make from the hunt.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Additional Hunts on the Way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Event Quest will bring Arch-tempered Rey Dau to Monster Hunter Wilds. Arch-tempered is a scale above the usual Tempered fight, making this a potentially challenging bout. You'll have to be HR 50 or above to challenge it, and new armor awaits those who can clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoh Shia is also getting its own fight. Previously, you'd only fight Zoh Shia once, as part of the main story. With the new update, you'll be able to re-fight Zoh Shia through new quests after reaching HR 50, and craft new armor from it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arena Quests</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunners get their own challenge to tackle in Arena Quests, which will allow hunters to compete for the fastest clear times. Both Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests will be available, with pendants given out for participation and achievement alike. You can access them through the counter in the new Grand Hub.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Change Alma's Outfit</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hardest-working handlers around is finally getting some cosmetic options. You'll be able to change Alma's attire through an appearance menu in camp, and one new outfit is being given out for free. After completing a certain side mission, you can also change out Alma's glasses.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-21-1742913507424.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More DLC is on the way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A mix of free and paid DLC is arriving in tandem with Title Update 1. Some additions, like some classic gestures from Monster Hunters prior, will be made freely available for hunters in the store. Others, like those in the Cosmetic DLC Pack 1, are available through the store, or for those who picked up the Cosmetic DLC Pass or Premium Deluxe Edition. New stickers, looks for Alma, and even more are on the way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-23-1742912586790.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More Event Quests and Seasonal Events</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more Event Quests are on the way, alongside Seasonal Events. The latter are special windows of time where the Grand Hub will change appearance, and available meals will also change. LImited equipment, gestures, decorations, and more are available during these Seasonal Events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seasonal Events kick off with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on April 23, adding pink cherry blossoms and some new decor to the game. Capcom confirmed that most previously available events and Event Quests should return in the future, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Roadmap Ahead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-24-1742912549128.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's how Title Update 1 and its related content will roll out over the coming months.

            <p>The second season of HBO's The Last of Us is almost upon us, and finally more about Catherine O'Hara's new character has been revealed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">O'Hara's casting was announced in February of last year</a>, although at this time who she was playing remained a mystery. There were rumours her character was called Gail, and these have ultimately been proven correct. But, who exactly is Gail?</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us (both games and the show) below</strong>.</p>

<p>In an interview during The Last of Us season 2's premiere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann confirmed O'Hara is playing a therapist living in Jackson, but also that she is - somewhat of a surprise to me - Eugene's wife. This marks a significant change from the games, and has made me curious about what this will mean for season two's story.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">it was announced Joe Pantoliano had joined The Last of Us' cast as Eugene</a>, a character mentioned in Part 2 but who doesn't appear in person, barring collectables.</p>

<p>In the game, Eugene is a patrolman who lived in Jackson before dying of a stroke aged 73. Prior to his death, he formed a close relationship with Dina (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-dina-and-alien-romulus-have-an-unexpected-connection">played in the show by Isabel Merced</a>). Little else is really known about Eugene, but players can find a letter in the game which reveals he had a wife and daughter, however he left them to join the Fireflies, where he served with Joel's brother Tommy.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Catherine-O-Hara-is-Gail-artwork-for-The-Last-of-Us.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
</figure>
<p>The showrunners previously said Eugene's story was going to be expanded upon for the show, with an episode akin to season one's Bill and Frank episode, so I assumed this meant they would be telling Eugene's story of leaving his family to join the Fireflies. Maybe it still will, and maybe O'Hara plays Eugene's second wife but… how will the fact that Joel killed a load of the Fireflies at the end of the first season impact those therapy sessions?!</p>
<p>Ooh, I am looking forward to finding out. You can check out a clip of O'Hara as Gail with Pedro Pascal's Joel in the second season of The Last of Us below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geoguessr-steam-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular geographical guessing game&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Steam, so you'll soon be able to completely fail to guess where on earth a random muddy field is through Valve's platform.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/geoguessr/status/1904516547806150715" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the game will be launching via Steam Early Access sometime in April, and the Early Access version will include both Solo Duels and Unranked Team Duels.</p>

<p>Playing Unranked Team Duels will be free, but the Solo Duels mode will require a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>Steam Pass. If you've got a subscription on the browser version of the game, that won't translate to the Steam edition, so you'll have to fork out some more cash if you want to play Solo Duels on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=K37JT8aw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=UILe_i1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, but there are a few catches.</figcaption></figure><p>You won't be able to use your&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>browser account to play the game on Steam; it's technically a new game, so it'll require a new account as well, although it sounds like you'll just be able to use your regular Steam profile.</p>

<p>You will, however, be able to access crossplay between&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>on Steam and the browser version of the game, so even if your buddies aren't playing via Steam, you should still be able to play with (or against!) them.</p>

<p>If you do intend to play Solo Duels, you'll rise through the ranks gradually in order to prove yourself as a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>champion. It promises to be exactly as addictive as the regular browser version of the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr</em>, the clue is in the name; it's a game that shows you a random picture from somewhere around the world, and it's up to you to use context clues (or just wild guesses) to figure out where the picture might show.</p>

If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early—which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates.

According to the Dring, publishers he spoke to have multiple plans in place just in case. </p><p>“If we move out of 2025, what if Rockstar do, too?” said one exec. “Will we have time to push our game up? Or will we have to delay further? It’s stressful.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Goat Simulator developers Coffee Stain North has announced the debut of its inaugural Goat Direct showcase on April 1, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-goat-direct-arrives-on-april-1">Goat Direct Arrives on April 1</h2>



<p>The highly anticipated Goat Direct is being hosted on April Fool’s Day, and many fans are wondering if this is all just an elaborate prank. However, the developers have explicitly stated that they “promise the ‘Goat Direct’ is real. The showcase is indeed happening, and all the announcements we see during the presentation “are legitimate. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted on April 1, the original Goat Simulator’s launch anniversary. During the event, fans should expect world premiere reveals for Goat Simulator 3 and some announcements from Coffee Stain North’s partner. The devs will also feature an update on the recently revealed Goat Simulator: The Card Game and more “top secret news.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-and-where-to-watch-goat-direct">How and Where to Watch Goat Direct?</h2>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted through a virtual live stream on the Goat Simulator YouTube channel. Interested players should tune in on April 1 at 15:00 BST / 16:00 CEST / 07:00 PDT / 10:00 EDT to hear all the new announcements first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santiago Ferrero, Creative Director at Coffee Stain North, has stated, “We do realise that announcing lots of new things on April Fool’s Day isn’t always the best of ideas, but we think we’ve truly outdone ourselves this year, so please believe us and tune in to ‘Goat Direct’!”</p>



<p>In other news, a recent claim states that a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct is expected this week</a>.

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch this June, and the new system will be accompanied primarily by first-party titles, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Earlier today,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> reported that during this year's GDC, there was much talk centered on the next-generation Nintendo console, which is expected to launch this June, as has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">rumored</a> for a while. The most interesting reveal, however, is regarding a three-phase games launch strategy, which will begin with a first phase featuring primarily first-party titles, followed by a second phase which should begin in October and November featuring games from third-party studios that should receive a development kit in June and a third phase that will coincide with the Holiday period.</p>
<p>Up until now, we have only heard rumblings and rumors regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, so it's nice to finally hear something about games, although today's report didn't provide any information regarding which games are expected to launch together with the highly-anticipated system. Thankfully, it won't be long until we will finally see something other than a new entry in the Mario Kart series running on the system, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the new system will air next week, on April 2nd. Hopefully, the presentation will also provide some information on what is expected to launch on the system beyond its release window.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will receive its first proper title update on Thursday, April 3rd PT and Friday, April 4th in the UK. The update adds a new social hub to the beast-bashing action-RPG, together with a new monster you might recognise from previous games, some tougher varieties of existing monsters, and a bunch of additional quest types and outfits. Plenty to chew on, once you pick out the bones. Here's a trailer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LryxlqiIi1A" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Let’s start with the monsters. These include the “dazzling and dangerous” Mizutsune, a returning face from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which will be available in both standard and eight-star Tempered varieties. It’s a big frilly rainbow lizard that “moves almost as if it’s dancing, and skillfully attacks foes with debilitating bubbles”, according to a PlayStation blog post. Hands up if you now wish there was a real-life dancing school that involved bubbles. (There probably is.) 
</p>
<p>
As with all of Monster Hunter’s apex predators, Mizutsune is a source of materials for new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-get-layered-armor">armour</a> sets. Where is my bubblesuit, Capcom? How am I supposed to do dancing emotes without a bubblesuit? To hunt (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-capture-monsters">capture</a>) the Mizutsune, talk to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp at Hunter Rank 21 or above. 
</p>
<p>
The first title update also begins Capcom’s rollout of “Arch-tempered” monsters - the toughest monster variations yet. First on the menu is the Arch-tempered Rey Dau, which will be available at Hunter Rank 50 or above as part of an event quest on Tuesday 30th April. 
</p>
<p>
Title update 1 also sees the return of the Zoh Shia in High Rank play, this being a critter that you could hitherto only fight once as part of the story. As of 3rd/4th April, you’ll be able to battle the Zoh Shia repeatedly. Look out for the High Rank Zoh Shia quest in the environment overview. You might also stumble on the poor dear during the Wyvern’s Wakening in the Ruins of Wyveria. Fell it and you can craft some new High Rank hunter and Palico equipment that, to my eye, makes you look like you’ve been tarred and feathered.</p>

</figure>
<p>That’s it for new monsters. But what about the <em>real</em> monsters here – other human players? Well, title update 1 introduces the Grand Hub, a majestic social space that has “long served as a place of worship for the people of Suja”, where carved totems rear above the tents and you might occasionally hear the songs of the faithful after dark. Also, it’s got a bowling alley where you roll barrel bombs at targets to win items and pedants. 
</p>
<p>
To do this, you’ll need Barrel Bowling Vouchers, which you can earn via login bonuses among other means. It’s a retention mechanism, in other words. The Grand Hub will be available from Hunter Rank 16 – just chat to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
What else? Well, they’re bringing back arena quests, which challenge you to complete a hunt as fast as possible using pre-determined equipment, together with limited-time Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests, where you can earn pendants. There’s a new free outfit for Alma, and some other cosmetic DLC gubbins.

</p>
<p>
Capcom are already teasing the game’s second title update, which lands this summer – there’s a glimpse of another new predator in the video above. There is, as yet, no word of any significant overhaul for the PC version’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">technical tribulations at launch</a>. I’m not sure how bad it is right now – have you had any frame rate issues lately?

<p>Capcom has revealed that Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1 will launch on Thursday April 3/Friday April 4, depending on your time zone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal came as part</a> of a 15-minute video on Tuesday that went into details on what players can expect to see in the game’s first major update. </p>



<p>First thing’s first, the title update will be free to all players. It will include a new monster called Mizutsune alongside a new Zoh Shia quest. There is also a new Grand Hub gathering place that players who’ve completed the game’s main story can get together and hangout as well as play a new game called Barrel Bowling. If you want a different type of entertainment, The Diva will be there to perform at night.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Aside from the title update at the beginning of April, there is more to come in late April and May. There is the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance coming from April 22/23 to May 6/7. The Arch-tempered Rey Dau event quest also comes at the end of April and lasts through late May.</p>



<p>Lastly, the second free title update for Monster Hunter Wilds will launch later this summer. That update will include an additional monster, a new seasonal event, and more.</p>

            <p>Nintendo will reportedly launch its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> games in three phases.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/">Insider Gaming</a>, the first phase will see <em>primarily </em>first party games released on the console's launch, which is believed to be June. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">console launch date ties in with what both analysts</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee have predicted will be the case</a>.</p>

<p>The second phase of Nintendo's game launch plan is then reportedly set for around October-November, and will have a greater focus on third-party studios. Sources said these studios are expecting to get their hands on a Switch 2 dev kit in June.</p>
<p>The third and final phase will tie in with the holiday period, Insider Gaming reports. So, to me that's the end of November and then December. 
</p>
<p>Thankfully, there isn't too much longer to go until we hear something more concrete on Nintendo's Switch successor. A dedicated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo Direct focused on the Switch 2 will take place on 2nd April</a>, where we'll presumably hear about the release date and price. And, just maybe, we will hear about more games coming to the console, so don't get your hopes up, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>? Ooh, what about Silksong?! We surely must be getting an update on that soon…</p>

			<p>Unlike other entries in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> isn't all about sneaking around and killing enemies unseen, but stealth is still a big part of the experience, especially if you like using Naoe a lot. While Yasuke can hold his own in a fight against multiple enemies, the shinobi from Iga is almost always at a disadvantage in open combat, as her toolkit is more geared towards stealth gameplay and taking down enemies without being discovered.</p>
<p>Unless you are equipping the best possible gear at any given time, however, Naoe is not always able to kill enemies in a single strike by approaching them silently and using the Assassination ability. Whether it's due to an enemy's high health or armor, there will be times when an Assassination attempt will result in open combat, which can be a massive issue for the young shinobi.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250325132249_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you want to improve Assassin's Creed Shadows' stealth gameplay features without having to constantly hunt down the best possible gear, there's an easy way to make sure both Naoe and Yasuke will always perform<strong> lethal Assassinations</strong>. At any time during the game, enter the O<strong>ptions menu</strong> and access the <strong>Gameplay</strong> tab.&nbsp;<span>Here, pick the&nbsp;<strong>Difficulty Tuning</strong> option, where you can set the Combat Difficulty and the Stealth Difficulty and <strong>turn on Guaranteed Assassinations</strong>.</span>&nbsp;By turning on this option, all your successful Assassinations will automatically kill the target, regardless of the remaining health.</p>
<p>While turning on Guaranteed Assassination in Assassin's Creed Shadows may feel a bit like cheating for some, it is a massive game changer for stealth gameplay, as without it, the Assassination ability leaves something to be desired most of the time. With it on, however, you don't have to worry about anything else other than sneaking around and being a proper, lethal assassin!</p>

<p>Per a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>showcase that aired earlier today,&nbsp;Title Update 1 will arrive on Friday, April 4th. The main attraction when it comes to this update is the introduction of Mizutsune, a water monster that made its first appearance in 2016's 3DS game&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll need to be High Rank level 21 or over to take on Mizutsune, and once you reach this level, you'll be able to grab an Extra Mission after speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest. That's the mission in which Mizutsune waits for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=biImuV5Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=rfjIgQcj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first title update is heading your way soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just Mizutsune that's coming as part of this update, of course. You can also look forward to battling a new Arch-tempered version of new monster Rey Dau, which will be added to the game in a new quest "at a later date".</p>

<p>Zoh Shia, another new monster introduced in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, can now be fought as part of repeatable quests, although you will need to complete a new HR 50 mission in order to access it.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a new hangout spot for you and your fellow hunters, then you can head over to the new Grand Hub, which serves as a place "for hunters to gather and socialize", according to Capcom. There's also a fun new minigame to try out there.</p>

<p>You can check out all of the highlights of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 1 <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_0/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> courtesy of Capcom, and you can take a look at a brand new trailer for the update below.</p>

It's proven to be the most popular game in the franchise by far, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million sales in just three days</a>&nbsp;and breaking records both for the series and for Capcom as a whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">on Steam</a>.</p>

They are, as with any other form of human-invented categorization, arbitrary. The notion of labeling any specific game as one “type” is inherently nonsensical, all art existing on an infinite spectrum, the boundaries of labels drawn utterly subjectively. That’s been the case forever, and it’s notable that about 15 years ago there were growing calls to abandon genre titles altogether as they felt so needlessly restrictive and confusing.</p><p>Of course, instead, we went in exactly the opposite direction and quadrupled down on the concept, as we entered the Era of Tagging. As we desperately tried to maintain some sense of order while the number of games released swelled from “a manageable few” to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands a month</a></span>,” we relied on genre tags to try to establish some notion of control. Except, oh dear God, it was done with no sense, understanding, meaning...it’s been sheer semantic vandalism, and the result is carnage.</p><figure id="" data-id="684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-recommend-id="image://684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Scott Olson / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-recommend-id="image://684987f11f6211db9ead6c29080eab45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of delicious-looking tomatoes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s really important that everyone’s on the same page regarding the subjective nature of genres. And for help, let’s look at fruit! You have, no doubt, either been the person, or been subjected to the person, loudly announcing that tomatoes are, in fact, not a vegetable actually, because they have internal seeds and so they’re a fruit. But, of course, tomatoes are actually a berry. Although a berry <em>is</em> a type of fruit. But it’s eaten, to quote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></span>, “as a vegetable.” Because “vegetable” is the word for the part of any plant that’s eaten as food. So <em>all fruit</em> are vegetables. So tomatoes are, of course, vegetables. And fruit. And berries. And broccoli is a flower. Pistachios and coffee beans are drupes, which are fruit. Avocados are maybe a drupe, maybe a berry, but definitely a fruit. Figs are an infructesence, filled with a multitude of single-seeded fruits (well, drupelets) created as a result of the pollination from specialized fig wasps, all surrounding the central “false fruit.” And peanuts are a legume. Let’s call the whole thing off.</p><p>The point is, <em>none of this is real</em>. These are all arbitrary categories invented by humans, into which the subjects do not usefully fit. Vegetation was just getting on with it, until we came along and tried to divvy them up into supermarket sections. And so it is for video games. Apart from the already existing bit.</p><figure id="" data-id="cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-recommend-id="image://cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-recommend-id="image://cfb83aa4f45b51225d727d0a351be27f" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the 1976 text adventure, Adventure, with white text on a black background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the very start of gaming, it just made sense to say, “Oh, those games are all adventures written entirely in text. Let’s call them ‘text adventures.’ And these ones are all about making that pixel blob jump between these platforms. They can be ‘platform games’.” That was useful for a good, solid ten minutes, before the imaginations of developers allowed for the merging of ideas, taking inspiration from here <em>and</em> there, and seeing what the results might be. In fairness, there were a fair few years when games could be quickly understood as “graphic adventures,” “god games,” “role-playing games,” or “strategy games,” albeit alongside the always-confusing category of “arcade games,” which originally meant games that were first released for arcade machines, and thus spread across a multitude of genres, but sort of came to mean games where things went “pew pew” and there was a high score table.</p><p>But even then, people were combining strategy and RPG, or including what were always called, in the snarliest of tones, “arcade sections” in graphic adventures. And then first-person shooters came along, so we needed “third-person shooters” to be a thing, and then the angle you looked at something from became a genre, hence “isometric,” and down into the madness we spiralled. I would say the moment all hope was lost was the point at which anyone, anywhere, thought “action game” might be a useful descriptor for <em>anything</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-recommend-id="image://a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="767" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-recommend-id="image://a771d0f9fc155036ea94240ff4f73819" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="767" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Hero Shooter tag page, featuring, um, Crysis 3 at the top." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, as I mentioned, post-millennium people began talking about the need to ditch genres as a concept entirely. I remember being involved in heated discussions at various gaming magazines over whether they would stop listing a game’s “genre” as part of the review, given how the decision was really being made based on the personal view of the reviewer, rather than anything inherently born of the game itself. When we were running <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>, the team would frequently argue  over the useful/uselessness of tagging games by genre. It seemed, across the industry, that this terminology might be on the way out.</p><p>And then Steam arrived.</p><p>So, obviously genres never went away. Some games just <em>are</em> the next big first-person shooter, or the real-time strategy game that—oh so ironically—“redefines the genre.” People like to know if something’s a fruit or a vegetable, even if neither term means anything useful in context, and we all knew that this new <em>Monkey Island</em> game was a “point and click adventure” whether we wanted to or not. They served a function, even if it was wildly imperfect, and often deeply unhelpful. (I always think of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> as the perfect example of a game series that can never be usefully classified, hence the absolute blithering nonsense of “action-adventure,” as if that isn’t a term that could be ascribed to just about anything short of a puzzle game.)</p><p>Up until this point, genres were pretty much decided by the developers, even if it was often begrudgingly. The need for a press release meant they had to call their game <em>something</em>, and  “defying genre” too quickly became associated with extremely off-putting braggadocio. Most instead opted for hyphenates, picking two of three genres their game sort of loosely fell into, describing their game as “first-person-strategy-adventure-typing-sim” or what have you. It was only more proof that the whole conceit was nonsense.</p><p>But then the floodgates opened, and everything got flipped upside down. In the last 15-or-so years the explosion of online stores, most especially Steam, and the ease of access to development tools like Unity and Unreal has caused the numbers of games released to grow explosively. From 2008 to 2012, around 300 games were releasing a year onto Steam. In 2012, Valve launched Steam Greenlight, via which games could be voted for to be allowed to release on store, and by 2017 that number had reached 7,000. That year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1265922321514182595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1265922321514182595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve ditched Greenlight</a></span> and replaced it with Steam Direct, where anyone could release a game on Steam if they paid $100. In 2020, around 10,000 games were released. By 2023 it was 14,000. Last year, 2024, that number hit 18,892.</p><figure id="" data-id="fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-recommend-id="image://fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1124" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-recommend-id="image://fbe1e1f1c6b5a153545589f22bbbba1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1124" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam's Adventure tag page, featuring no adventure games at all." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While developers can select their own genre categories, Steam, as Valve is so wont to do, handed over much of the responsibility for the labelling of genres to its users. And as anyone who’s ever met a group of other people will know, they’re <em>idiots</em>, and giving them the ability to tag games on the online store has led to a whole new form of chaos. Where a decade-and-a-half ago we were taking steps toward a beautiful genre-free future, we’ve now instead just taken a sharp left and jumped off a nearby cliff. Genres now mean <em>nothing whatsoever</em>.</p><p>I first became frustrated by this phenomenon by the demolition of the “adventure” genre. It was, for my entire life, used to describe...well, “adventure games”! These began in the late-70s, early-80s as text adventures, and during the ‘80s evolved into graphic adventures which, once mice became commonplace, would become known as “point-and-click adventures.” (The term has a rather quaint, anachronistic tone nowadays, given that the act of pointing and clicking is hard to remember as revolutionary, but it was meant to distinguish these games from those graphic adventures in which you primarily engaged via a text parser. To this day, among decent-minded people, “point-and-click” has semiotic meaning, a game of the ilk of <em>Monkey Island</em>, <em>Day of the Tentacle</em>, <em>Gabriel Knight</em>, or <em>The Longest Journey</em>. You move a character around scenes, gather items into an inventory, chat with other characters, and solve puzzles by using inventory items on the world.)</p><p>Yet, click on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the “Adventure” tag in Steam</a></span> and you might as well have clicked on a tag for “Game.” The first few games it suggests to me are <em>Pathologic 2</em> (a first-person RPG), <em>Into The Necrovale</em> (a top-down hack-and-slash roguelite), <em>Dark Deity 2</em> (a turn-based strategy RPG!), and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> (an open-world action-RPG). See! Those are literally the first four I saw under the tag, each a wildly different type of game, and none of them in any sense an “adventure.” With half of them, it’s hard to even argue that they’re about <em>having an adventure</em>.</p><p>But it’s so, so much worse than that. Because, you might say, “Oh get over it, old man. We cool kids use ‘adventure’ to describe...games...that exist! Use something more specific!” So OK, I know, I’ll search for something far more precise, the unimpeachably clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure_point_click&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/adventure_point_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Point &amp; Click Adventures.”</a></span></p><p><em>Mr. Prepper</em>: A survival crafting sim.</p><p><em>Steps of Debauchery</em>: A porn visual novel.</p><p><em>Urban Jungle</em>: A “relaxing” puzzle game about growing plants.</p><p><em>Let’s Minesweeper</em>: An online multiplayer tile puzzle game.</p><p>SERIOUSLY?!</p><p>However, I absolutely cannot deny that all these games contain the ability to point a mouse and click. Much like <em>Doom Eternal</em> and <em>Civilization VII</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dan Kitwood / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://a4e747ad02dd5860251951c98683a4c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A whole bunch of fly-tipped trash in a field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And so, my opening thesis is proven correct, all opposition is demolished, and everyone in the whole world owes me and everyone else an apology.</p><p>The same phenomenon is true across all genres on Steam, and it’s just the same on Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo’s online stores. These terms have become, for want of a better word, clickbait. People search for this genre term, so stick it on the game. I just looked up “Real-Time Strategy” on Steam (a genre for which I have no interest) and it immediately offered me <em>DOTA 2</em>, then threw in a good handful of turn-based strategy and tower defence games, and <em>so</em> many city builders.</p><p>15 years ago we were arguing that genres were useless because they needlessly boxed in creativity, applying artificial labels to a medium that inherently defied them. It felt reductive to describe a game as Type C instead of Type F, a process that failed to usefully communicate nuance. We are now so bloody far through that looking glass, and have emerged in a place where it’s the genres themselves that defy classification, where they’ve all become gobbledegook words that mean nothing and can be applied to anything. We wanted to be post-genre, but we’ve instead become post-meaning.</p><p>Why does it matter? Well, because I want to be able to find new point-and-click adventures on Steam, for one thing, and cannot find them buried beneath an avalanche of games that let you use your mouse on the menus. But beyond that, it matters because it’s just more empty cacophony in a world where those with power are trying to destroy any sense of meaning.</p><p>Is there a fix? No, I don’t think so. Sorry, that’s not very satisfying, is it? I think, like vegetation, we’ve just muddled ourselves to the point where we don’t know where we’re supposed to go in the gaming supermarket to find the games we want to consume. It’s too late. We broke it. We’re stuck with some useless nothing now.</p><p>Although, if you want a pithy closer, you could argue the AAA publishers are doing their bit by only investing in open-world action games, soulslikes or hero shooters. That certainly refines things a little.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All eyes in the video game industry are watching to see when Grand Theft Auto 6 will release. The potential impact on the industry is expected to be very large, but several publishers planning to release games around the same time are ready to delay just to get out of its way.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-don-t-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">“We Don’t Want to Be Anywhere Near That”</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Christopher Dring</a> of the recently launched outlet The Game Business, “three major video game publishers” are ready to delay their games to avoid GTA 6. Dring says that the boss “of one of the world’s biggest game publishers” told him: “Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market. We don’t want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles.”</p>



<p>This past weekend at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco, Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson was told by a few developers that they’re “waiting to see what GTA 6 does.” Back in December, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that competing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishers are “waiting as long as possible to commit to their release date.”</a></p>



<p>The launch of GTA 6, tentatively scheduled for October 2025, reportedly isn’t just scaring off major new releases. According to Dring, two developers of “top 10 live-service games” are not planning any significant updates during the GTA 6 launch window. One studio boss reportedly said that they would “nudge” their releases ahead or backwards three weeks just to avoid GTA 6. The studio heads that spoke to Dring spoke of other potential issues, like a crowded schedule of other games trying to avoid GTA 6, but those problems seem preferable than trying to compete with a potentially industry-altering release. However, as one industry consultant noted at GDC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting on GTA 6 only for it to delay could “tank” those developers</a>.</p>



<p>Are game developers perhaps being too cautious of the GTA 6 release, or are they wise to get out of the way? Let us know down in the comments below!
