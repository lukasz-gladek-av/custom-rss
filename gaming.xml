Perhaps we can even expect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-yuri-lowenthal" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d0a3961-f7b9-4d4a-8bfd-9b72ce8d096a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Yuri Lowenthal to leak this one as well</a>!

<p>The one thing I wouldn't hold your breath for when it comes to this website is an announcement for <em>Persona 6</em>. Atlus is busy with the aforementioned <em>Persona 4 </em>remake, and the studio is also still celebrating <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e36e5f7f-aa76-4099-89f0-cc0de577a8fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the success</a> of its latest RPG <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>(although that, admittedly, is made by the newly-formed Studio Zero).</p><p>With that said, Atlus has said that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-director-no-plans-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eb30c86-5461-470b-923e-8c96fcd0675c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">doesn't currently have plans</a> to expand <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>into a series, so it's possible that the focus has shifted towards <em>Persona</em> for now. If <em>Persona 6 </em>was to be announced, then the 30th anniversary celebrations for the franchise as a whole would seem an ideal time to do so.</p><p>In the meantime, while you wait for a <em>Persona 6 </em>announcement (or whatever Atlus has in store for the anniversary), you can celebrate the franchise's music thanks to the <em>Persona </em>concert tour <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-concert-us-january-date-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d8554b0-8365-410f-a8ba-d0bee07489a8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">making its way to the US in January</a>.</p><p>Back in September, the franchise also received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-music-video" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dee0e73a-8716-4317-9058-a4d024355fa1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its first official music video</a> in the form of a clip for "It's Going Down Now", the iconic battle theme from 2024's <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Atlus plans to reveal as part of the <em>Persona </em>30th anniversary celebrations. Make sure to keep an eye on the website if you want to be the first to see it!</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Pokémon mania continues to spread around the world, and 2026 is set to be a huge year for the franchise, which celebrates 30 years since the release of the first games in Japan.</p>



<p>In the three decades since, Pokémon has introduced over 1,000 creatures to catch and collect in video games, alongside thousands of anime episodes, full-length films, an extremely successful TCG, and countless spin-off titles.</p>



<p>With next year being such a landmark occasion for the Pokémon franchise, Insider Gaming has taken a look at what to expect from the company in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026">What to Expect From Pokémon in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New World Order. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-launches-a-new-series-of-games">Pokopia Launches a New Series of Games</h3>



<p>Due to launch on March 5, Pokopia is set to be the first Pokémon title to release in 2026, and the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive for the franchise—although there is a way to play on the original Switch.</p>



<p>The concept of a Pokémon version of an Animal Crossing-like game seems like a perfect match and if the title is as successful as it looks likely to be, it will likely spark the start of a new series of games.</p>



<p>Pokopia may feature Pokémon from a variety of generations, but it appears to be set in Kanto, with a post-apocalyptic theme leaked, which leaves the door open to adventures across even more regions in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set for Pokémon is a surefire guarantee, with trademarks already registered in Japan. It doesn’t take a genius to predict them, as previous anniversaries saw the Celebrations set release in 2021, and Generations in 2016.</p>



<p>Exactly what Pokémon has up their sleeve remains to be seen, though they could opt to reprint classic cards once again. There are countless possibilities, however, and plenty of debate around what would be the best move for Pokémon<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Either way, it’s a guaranteed money-spinner for the Pokémon franchise, particularly given the craziness in the market currently, which, sadly, doesn’t look likely to stop for a while.</p>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-releases-on-nintendo-switch-2">Gen 10 Releases on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>



<p>2026 will mark four years since the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, making it the longest gap between generation releases since Black and White were released in 2010, and the next generation of Pokémon<strong> </strong>is almost certain to arrive next year.</p>



<p>Pokémon Day 2026 would be the perfect time for the first reveal, and it seems likely to be when the first teaser will be shown, with a full release coming at the back-end of 2026 in a similar spot to where Legends: Z-A released this year.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for original Switch players, Gen 10 is likely to be the first main title released as a Switch 2 exclusive, setting a precedent for future releases to follow.</p>



<figure><figcaption>New generation. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-black-amp-white-remakes">Pokémon Black &amp; White Remakes</h3>



<p>Black and White are the next games in line for a remake, and were widely expected to be released this year, but Pokémon went quiet and, following on from the rather disappointing Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in 2021, it could be that the entire approach has shifted.</p>



<p>Remakes of Gen 5 are inevitable at some point, however, and they’d be the perfect signing-off game for the Switch era, releasing on both the original console and Switch 2. </p>



<p>Black and White remakes in 2026 are far from a guarantee, however, as the aforementioned Gen 4 remake titles seem to have left a lasting impact, and not in a good way. That’s all for the best, though, as it’s better for time to be taken to hit the remakes in the way that Heart Gold and Soul Silver did, for example.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansions">More Pokémon TCG Pocket Expansions</h3>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has achieved vast success in its first year since its initial release, and it’s only going to get bigger from here, which makes more expansions in the game in 2026 one of the easiest predictions to make.</p>



<p>TCG Pocket has moved into the Mega Evolution scene with the start of the ‘B’ sets, a trend likely to remain for the foreseeable future, but it’s already exciting to consider what could be on the horizon, considering the game has almost 30 years of TCG history to reflect back on for inspiration.</p>



<p>A 30th anniversary set in TCG Pocket seems to be a solid bet for sure, and there are plenty of options when Gen 10 comes around, too. </p>



<h3 id="h-another-pokemon-mobile-title">Another Pokémon Mobile Title</h3>



<p>A flurry of Pokémon titles have been released on mobile devices in recent years, including big hits like Pokémon Go, TCG Pocket, Cafe Remix, and more, so it isn’t hard to see another Pokémon title launch onto mobile in 2026.</p>



<p>It’s already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be released on mobile, but an entirely new game is possible. There are endless possibilities, with the ability to tie into existing games or offer something different entirely.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-lego-sets-make-a-wave">Pokémon LEGO Sets Make a Wave</h3>



<p>After an eternity of waiting, Pokémon and LEGO have finally partnered together, and the first sets from the huge collab will be released in 2026, but expect there to be a fight to secure them.</p>



<p>LEGO and Pokémon are both extremely popular hobbies, with both fanbases often having a fight to get the products they want, so don’t be surprised if you struggle to find any LEGO Pokémon products in your local store.</p>



<p>The good news is, LEGO is a lot better at making sure products are available long-term and in greater quantity than Pokémon’s TCG side, so it shouldn’t lead to a scalper frenzy.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/12/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-promotion-coming-to-the-u-s-for-franchises-30th-anniversary">a report from PokéBeach</a>, it will run from February into March, with exact dates depending on the country, but that's all the details known right now.</p>
<p>Past events — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/scalpers_and_collectors_buy_up_mcdonalds_pokemon_happy_meals">for the 25th anniversary, for example</a> — have seen scalpers rocking up to stores and buying <em>dozens</em> of Happy Meals to get the cards. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/mcdonalds_uk_plans_to_restrict_pokemon_happy_meal_toy_purchases">McDonald's in the UK</a> put a restriction on buying more than one extra card with your meal following the frenzy in the US, but that feels like trying to stop a geyser with a bathplug.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fmgoztj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The Pokémon Company and Ronald have persevered, though - there was a Dragon-type collab <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-cards-soar-back-into-mcdonalds-uk-happy-meals">earlier in 2025</a>. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">back in August</a>, a three-day Pikachu event in Japan was stopped after 24 hours when demand for the card exceeded supply, with boxes of unopened cards turning up for sale online. <em>Shifty.</em> That one was particularly sought after, though, as the card featured exclusive artwork.</p>
<p>It's a shame that Pokémon cards just seem to attract a manic mix of the FOMO crowd (ask the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/van-gogh-museum-fires-four-employees-following-pokemon-collaboration">Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum</a>) and straight-up scalpers, bringing out the worst in people who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-scalpers-are-ignoring-tornado-warnings-just-to-nab-latest-card-collection">ignore tornado warnings</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/random-try-not-to-cringe-watching-this-video-of-a-pokemon-tcg-scalper">behave atrociously</a> to get their hands on fresh packs.</p>
<p>We'll see in February if TPC and McDonald's have any clever plans to combat the problem.</p>

            <guid>1394932</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has appeared for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>on Nintendo Switch 2, suggesting that a full Switch 2 Edition version of the game could be on the way soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Splatoon+3" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a> (which was first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/splatoon-3-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>) lists the release date as December 31st, although that's almost certainly a placeholder, unless Nintendo intends to release the game in the next few hours. It's unlikely, but it's not impossible!</p><p>If a Switch 2 Edition of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>is planned, it'll be a different prospect to the free update released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="838585b0-e552-447b-bbf4-87e2329e177e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a few months ago</a>, which was announced alongside a brand new <em>Splatoon </em>spinoff game. Nintendo hasn't revealed any new info about that project yet, but we'll probably learn more about <em>Splatoon Raiders </em>in the new year.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Splatoon 3 </em>could be getting a Switch 2 Edition version soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Naturally, the game bears the same PEGI rating as its Switch version, which is to say a PEGI 7. The rating warns those buying <em>Splatoon 3 </em>about its "violence" and "in-game purchases", so if you're planning to pick it up on Switch 2, you have been warned.</p><p>The <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Switch 2 listing follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="606f040c-e9d7-4046-8557-17a8d3ce9a10" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">cessation of updates for the game</a> back in 2024, but don't worry if you haven't played for a while; the servers are very much still operational, so you can still enjoy games of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>whenever you like.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it is, as you might expect, the third installment of the <em>Splatoon </em>series, and like its predecessors, the game revolves around quick shootouts in which the goal is to ink the most territory for your team (although other modes are available as well).</p><p>The game also features a single-player campaign that's a little more fleshed out than those of its predecessors, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-fresh-season-2024-side-order-gameplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c071dd8-431c-4f24-a396-4cd2494ff2fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">roguelike-focused DLC</a> expansion that was released back in 2024.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Splatoon 3 </em>right now on Switch, and if this listing is to be believed, it'll be launching on Switch 2 soon as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the latest edition of the so-called '<strong><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of the Sanderson</a></strong>', the yearly recap that the popular fantasy author writes to let his fans know what he's worked on and what's next, <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong> revealed that he's been talking to triple-A game companies to make a <strong>Mistborn game</strong> happen. Here's the relevant quote from the blog post:</p>



<p><em>I’ve started to get some real interest on the video game front, and I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. To that end, I’ve started talking to some AAA developers. This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging one. These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last… oh, six~seven years, so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m trying to do things differently this time in an effort to retain control of my video game rights. I already have interest from some major players in the Video Game industry (who I like a lot). So if you are a decision maker at a AAA studio, or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a Mistborn or Stormlight game… well, you would want to contact my reps now.</em></p>



<p>The key change is that Sanderson had unwisely decided to license the film and game rights together, and ultimately, neither thing happened. In October 2016, the author selected DMG Entertainment as the licensee of not just Mistborn but the entire <strong>Cosmere</strong> (Sanderson's fantasy universe, where most of his books are set), and an adaptation of Mistborn: The Final Empire was planned, but the project stalled.</p>



<p>Presumably, the gaming rights have now reverted to the author, who is now free to seek a new partner for the game adaptation. There once was a project called Mistborn: Birthright, announced in 2012 and developed by Little Orbit (which would later be infamously known for the failure of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029260/Unsung_Story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsung Story</a>), but it was canceled.</p>



<p>Sanderson himself is a massive gamer. In early 2022, he made headlines when he jokingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/brandon-sanderson-complains-about-fromsoftwares-choice-of-george-r-r-martin-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complained</a> that<strong> FromSoftware</strong> had picked <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong> author <strong>G.R.R. Martin</strong> to help them create the mythos of <strong>Elden Ring</strong>. He did contribute to a game shortly afterward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-series-developer-announces-turn-based-tactical-game-moonbreaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working with <strong>Unknown Worlds</strong> on the turn-based strategy game <strong>Moonbreaker</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Still, there's no question that he's very excited about the prospect of a triple-A game set on <strong>Scadrial</strong> (the world where Mistborn takes place). As a massive fan of all things Sanderson, Mistborn very much included, I am equally intrigued. There's a lot of potential for an action RPG here, especially with the incredibly deep mythology already established by Sanderson and the cool allomancy and feruchemy magic systems.</p>



<p>Who would you pick as the ideal developer of a Mistborn game? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<p>It's almost 2026, and while a new year is always exciting, a new month means another batch of PS Plus games is headed towards PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium tier subscribers. In what has practically become a monthly tradition, a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-vous-revele-le-premier-jeu-du-mois-de-lannee-2026-60812">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has revealed one of the games that kicks off the year for PS Plus Essential subscribers: Need for Speed Unbound.</p>



<p>The latest Need for Speed game in the franchise, Unbound arrived on current-gen consoles on December 2, 2022. It was a more-than-solid racer at the time of its launch, though it wasn't able to reach the highs that made the series so iconic. Though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-charging-5-dollars-to-unlock-map-markers-new-races-challenges/">decidedly fell off the radar of players not too long after its debut,</a> developer Criterion Games and Codemasters have done a good job of updating it with multiple drops of new cars, tracks, challenge modes, etc. </p>



<p>As Wccftech's Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-unbound/">put it in his review of the game at launch</a>, "<em>Need for Speed Unbound is the franchise’s best entry in a decade, although the competition for that title wasn't particularly stiff. The game offers polished tech, good (if slightly dated) open-world design, and a varied array of events and challenges, but still lags behind the current open-world racer pack leaders. The fantasy of becoming an underground racing champ is also hampered by a restrictive, ill-considered progression system. Nostalgic fans will find plenty to like here, and more general players might want to consider a test drive once the game is marked down, but “need” may be a strong word to attach to Criterion’s latest.</em>"</p>



<p>The game's last major update, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-unbound/news/end-of-kaizen-review">Volume 9, arrived earlier in 2025,</a> though Criterion has had its focus shift away from Need for Speed while it worked on delivering Battlefield 6 this past October. Its arrival as a PS Plus Essential game will technically be the second time it has been added to PlayStation's subscription service, as it was made a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-february-2024-assassins-creed-valhalla-nfs-unbound-tales/">PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalog title back in February 2024</a>.</p>



<p>So, unfortunately for those subscribers, you're technically getting one game less than you otherwise would if Unbound weren't already available to subscribers on the Extra or above tiers. Though there's always the chance that an added game coming to Extra and Premium subscribers only will make up for it.</p>



<p>It should also be mentioned that, while Billbil-kun has an immaculate record at this point when it comes to announcing PS Plus titles early (they've almost never been wrong), it is still an unofficial report at the time of this writing. So take it for what it's worth. </p>



<p>If you don't believe it'll be one of the three free games for Essential subscribers, and you wouldn't mind starting your 2026 by checking it out, then you can always grab it on the PS Store with the Ultimate Collection edition, currently at 85% off for PlayStation's Holiday Sale.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s HDMI Switch Crashes Below $10 With Final Discount, Compatible With TV, Laptop, PC, Xbox, Playstation, Projector, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-hdmi-switch-crashes-below-10-with-final-discount-compatible-with-tv-laptop-pc-xbox-playstation-projector-and-more-2000656187</link>
            <guid>1394902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Don’t look now, but Amazon has this Anker HDMI switch on sale for 38% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/">That shaves the price down by six whole dollars, bringing the price down from $16 to an even $10.</a></p>
<p>Old hats me remember the dark ages of television inputs. Between my cousins and I, we had an original NES that we kept at our grandmas house. This way we would always have something to do while over. This was when the SNES and even N64 had been out already, so we were retro gamers early on. Anyway, the TV in the backroom with the NES only had one coaxial hookup, which would always be set up to the cable box. It was at the back of the TV which was too heavy for any of us to move, so every visit started with one of us reaching our arm back there blindly to unscrew the cable box cable and then screw in the NES cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Since those “switch the input to channel 3,” days, things have gotten much easier, with TVs offering multiple inputs which you can swap between. Though not every modern TV is equipped with enough ports. Maybe you’ve got a cable box, your Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. If your TV isn’t packing at least four inputs, then you too will be living in the old days of reaching behind the TV to unplug one console to plug in another.</p>
<h2>HDMI Switching Simplified</h2>
<p>You don’t have to live like this. This is the exact scenario that the Anker HDMI switch was designed for. It has two inputs and one output. Just plug two of your consoles into the front end and out the back plug it into your TV. With just the click of a button, you can swap between either of the two inputs. It’s all hassle-free and you can say goodbye to reaching behind your TV to the jungle of tangled cables ever again.</p>



<p>The Anker HDMI switch has a wide range of compatibility. Set it up with a laptop, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, or even a streaming stick like a Fire TV or Roku. And then the other end can hook up to your TV, a monitor, a projector, or even an HDMI compatible VR headset.</p>
<p>It supports resolutions of up to 4K and refresh rates of up to 60Hz, so choose wisely which consoles you choose to go through this instead of your TV’s native HDMI inputs. You won’t be able to make use of the PlayStation 5 Pro’s high-frame rates of 120fps. Also, the switch does not support HDMI CEC. This is the tech that will turn your TV on the same time you turn on your Nintendo Switch or something like that.</p>

            <guid>1394896</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Sometimes, on my better days, I think I know the answer to what keeps me up at night. Or that I have it in me to figure it out. I like those days because even though they start with a problem, I know where to go, what to do, or who to ask to solve it. That's a pretty good day. Not too many of those lately.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps this is why, when considering the year that was, mysteries – particularly video game mysteries – come to mind. Of all the entertainment released in 2025, I was drawn to these the most: I know the dirty secret of the Roottree family. I know why Evelyn Deane disappeared from Blake Manor. I know the truth about Mt. Holly Estate. Some questions wormed into my head, and I answered them. I had problems, and I solved them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When executed well, sleuthing suits video games even more naturally than violence, a contest between the programming logic of video games and the human ability to think laterally. One of the first things you learn about coding is that computers are literal to a degree that is, frankly, madness-inducing. The genius of any particular application, including video games, lies in how elegantly it hides the fact that it is reducing your every input into a cascade of simple binary decisions. However, even with a program designed to do all of the heavy lifting for you, even with all the cumulative experience of the internet at your disposal, sometimes the thing that lies between you and your goal is the wildly frustrating task of figuring out how to ask the right question.&nbsp;</p><p>This also happens to be the engine that drives a good mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>On a basic level, a video game mystery narrativizes one of the most fundamental computational functions: Querying a database. (The narrative designer <a href="https://brunodias.itch.io/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bruno Dias</u></a> has called games expressly built around that function "database thrillers" for this reason, going so far as to jam out his own – quite good! –&nbsp; text parser version of one, <a href="https://brunodias.itch.io/kinophobia?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Kinophobia</u></em></a>.) Defining the right parameters that will separate the endless sea of useless data from the precious and narrow set of information you can actually use, perhaps to form another query in turn, rendering previously useless data into something vital. Once again: Asking the right questions.&nbsp;</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The Roottrees Are Dead (Evil Trout)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754380/The_Roottrees_are_Dead/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Roottrees Are Dead</u></em></a>, Jeremy Johnston and Robin Ward's 2025 remake of Johnston's browser game of the same name, operates on this fundamental level. It casts the player as an amateur genealogist, asked by a mysterious client to trace the family tree of the Roottree sisters. Recently deceased in a private plane crash just before the start of the game, the sisters are heirs to a massive family fortune, and their untimely demise means a significant windfall for the extended family.&nbsp;</p><p>The pleasures of <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em> lie in doing the task it sets out for you in its simulated tactility. The game is set in 1998, and in researching the Roottree family, the player bounces between a table with relevant documents and photographs to examine, a corkboard where they lay out the family tree, and a desktop computer with a blistering 56k modem for surfing the information superhighway. A notebook, available at the push of a button, allows you to type notes or collect highlighted passages from your research materials. Using all these tools, a family's history becomes a giant jigsaw puzzle, a deductive riddle that feels impossible until you just buckle down and do the work. One good lead yields another, and then another, and finally you have names and faces and the puzzle begins to take shape. </p><p>But these aren't just puzzle pieces: They're people. The connections and if/then questions that determine where they fit in the Roottree pedigree are just part of the story. What makes <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em> such an exceptional game is in the way it tells you from the start that one branch of the family tree is off-limits until the end, an optional question where the answer isn't so much there to be found as it is inferred. In laying out the endgame this way, Johnston and Ward provoke the player: Were you merely solving the puzzle? Or were you paying attention to the story it told? You know the what – how about why? Can you see the people hidden between the data points?&nbsp;</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The Seance Of Blake Manor (Spooky Doorway)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the twilight of the 19th century, the massive disruption of the industrial revolution left European high society in a state of unease, as the edges of a carefully-constructed social order began to crumble. Literacy spread among the middle class, the world shrank as steamships sent people all over the globe, new customs and experiences shook the once–strong foundations of Christian institutions. For many people of means and those who aspired to such status, the church was insufficient at addressing their moment of malcontent. The occult took root.&nbsp;</p><p>Set in the final three days of October 1897, <a href="https://aftermath.site/seance-of-blake-manor/"><em><u>The Seance of Blake Manor</u></em></a> follows Declan Ward, a detective from Dublin, after he receives a mysterious commission to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. Deane was one of a number of mystics and magic-curious from all over the world invited to Blake Manor, a hotel in Western Ireland, for a Grand Seance to take place on Samhain, the day when the veil between the mortal world and the spirit realm is thinnest. Assuming the role of Ward, the player wanders the eponymous manor, snooping through rooms and asking guests questions, each exchange or observation deepening the mystery of Ms. Deane's disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em> is a work of folk horror, which means that history has something to say here, whether the story's characters are able to hear it or not. (They will pay if they don't.) While a far more traditional narrative than <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em>, <em>Blake Manor </em>is similarly powerful in its subtext. Every character is haunted by some private thing that has brought them to the seance; each is fleeing something or in denial or mourning or desperation. It causes them to be cruel, selfish, reckless. You can piece these backstories together for as many characters as you wish – the game encourages you to solve them all – but what lingers for me is the weight of all that history.&nbsp;</p><p>In the search for Evelyn Deane, Declan Ward must repeatedly contend with the beliefs of others. He learns much about Irish folklore, of the fae and the Other World and the Tuatha Dé Danann, the pagan deities worshipped in Gaelic Ireland before Christianity arrived in the country. He sees evidence of the ways both Catholics and Protestants have incorporated those pagan traditions, turning them into saints or holy days. He meets people from around the world who have their own version of those same saints and gods.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Blake Manor </em>requires you to note all this, and think about it some. Learning the faith of each character you meet is integral to solving its mystery. But in this story, Christ and Allah are both just characters in books. The pagan deities, however, are very much real.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't believe this is the game choosing a side, asserting that the pagans had it right and everything else is just a fairytale. Rather, I think <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em>'s choice to slowly, deliberately communicate that, in its fiction, the folkloric deities are real is meant to underline the ways in which the indigenous beliefs and cultures of a place are never really gone, even after waves of colonization, industry, and plunder. The spirits are real in <em>Blake Manor</em> because we have fooled ourselves into thinking that wealthy men who build monuments to their fortunes and family name are the only ones who get to write their stories upon the land, forgetting that the land might have stories of its own. Will you seek them out, even if you don't have to? Will you carry that history within you, and keep it alive just a little while longer?&nbsp;</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Blue Prince (Dogubomb)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like many others this year, I have lost <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review/" rel="noreferrer">countless nights</a> in search of the secret 46th room in the Mt. Holly Estate, and for the bewildering number of mysteries Room 46 is but a mere prelude to. I have many of the answers I set out to find, but I still have further questions beyond them. I also know that the point here may very well be learning to quit.&nbsp;</p><p>It's remarkable that Tonda Ros' <em>Blue Prince</em> is structured as a roguelike, a genre defined by its endlessness and infinite possibility. This brings the game in conflict with its narrative setup, which casts the player as Simon P. Jones, a young boy who has learned his wealthy uncle has willed his entire estate to him – provided he can find the hidden 46th room in the logic-defying 45-room mansion that changes its layout every day. Such an explicit goal implies an ending, and upon achieving it, credits do roll. But as anyone who has played <em>Blue Prince </em>knows, that ending is merely <em>an</em> ending. It is also not a solution. Simon's strange quest, the magical nature of the house – which, after enough excursions, is clearly diegetic and not just an allowance for gameplay – are the first of many <em>whys</em> that are left unsaid by that initial ending.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus the real mystery of <em>Blue Prince </em>begins, but what that mystery is largely depends on the player. What about this house and the family who built it did you notice, or care about? What in its many possible configurations, its hidden foundations, its many scrawled notes that double back and recontextualize previous findings, bedevils you? Is the game truly endless, like its genre structure implies? <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><u>Can you be at peace with that</u></a>? Or do you refuse to accept it?&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Consider again how well-suited games are for mystery, how they can present players with impossible enigmas but also guide and nudge them towards asking the right questions. Games can assure players that the world is knowable. We talk about power fantasies, and perhaps this is the most seductive one, even more so than those that give us guns or impossible abilities or great destinies. The fantasy of a world that fits together.&nbsp;</p><p>I find that fantasy alluring. Justice has been lacking in my lifetime, and it may not be my lot to see it win the day. I like the idea that asking the right question is the first step to making sense of the world. And if I ask the right question and then answer it skillfully, I can find some kind of peace. Or at least, know what it is that will give me a direction to walk until I find it.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a delusion, but a useful one. Answers aren't what make questions worth asking, but go long enough without finding your way to one and, well. That's a lot of sleepless nights. Sometimes you need a ballast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If there is a reason these games are the mysteries that have resonated with me most strongly this year, this is why: because while they provide all the pleasures of a solvable problem, of crimes answered for, they <em>also</em> present me with so much I cannot know. Of how much escapes the record of material evidence in the gaps of a family tree or a nigh-forgotten folkloric tradition or the inscrutable patterns of an ever-shifting mansion. There is tragedy in this, but also grace, and humility. In grappling with them, solving a mystery takes on another, more durable purpose: making peace with what I don't know, so I can be brave with what I do know. Every day I'm able to do that would make for a good day. Every year I strive for that goal would be a good year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>2025 was practically defined by Indie Games, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> running away with (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stripped-of-indie-game-awards-goty-win-over-genai-use/">almost</a>) every Game of the Year win, Hollow Knight Silksong and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Hades 2</a> finally landing and consuming the entire industry for at least a month. While other titles like Peak, Blue Prince, The Seance of Blake Manor, Dispatch, Ball x Pit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/">Eternal Strands</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/routine-review-lunar-software-raw-fury/">Routine</a>, and Megabonk, to name a few, stole attention away from big-name releases across the whole year.</p>



<p>So, will 2026 be any different? We can probably bet on at least one unsuspecting indie game taking the spotlight that no one sees coming, but it's more of a gamble to say 2026 will be as defined by indies as 2025 was.</p>



<p>That said, there are a few indie games that we know are coming up that could absolutely dominate the conversation, even be Game of the Year contenders. These are Wccftech's most anticipated indie games for 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-ii-march-2026-pc">Slay the Spire II (March 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slay-the-Spire-2-Key-Art-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Slay the Spire 2 key art. Image credit: Mega Crit</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>A game that made our list for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">2025's Most Anticipated Indie Games</a>, Slay the Spire II returns to the 2026 list after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-delayed-march-2026-mega-crit/">was delayed "<em>to a secret Thursday in March 2026</em>" back in September 2025</a>. Mega Crit may not have put a specific release date on it, but specifying that it will arrive on one of four possible Thursdays feels like the studio is confident it won't have to delay the early access release again - at least not so far that it won't arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire II is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most popular deckbuilding roguelike games of all time, and Mega Crit is one of the biggest success stories to come from the indie world. It's early access arrival will be one of the bigger events of 2026 for indie games, and even in its early access form, it could be a potential contender for Game of the Year 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-mina-the-hollower-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Mina the Hollower (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mina-the-Hollower-Delayed.png"></a><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower. Image credit: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another game that was supposed to arrive in 2025 but got pushed into 2026, Mina the Hollower is the long-awaited return of Yacht Club Games, the studio behind the critically acclaimed platformer Shovel Knight. What <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-delayed-yacht-club-games/">was not intended to be "<em>a major delay</em>"</a> ended up becoming one, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDY4MDU4MywiZXhwIjoxNzY1Mjg1MzgzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNk41RDBLR0NURlkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.tTCDzLvXeRacM9mzJfRv3juJV7WGiMAKvYS8DWRQBFs">a report from Bloomberg</a> revealed deeper issues within the studio as to why the game was taking so long.</p>



<p>That said, Yacht Club is an incredibly talented team, and this old-school Legend of Zelda-style adventure game with an energetic mouse and the same incredible pixel-art the studio is known for behind it all means that you cannot count Mina the Hollower out.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch">The Eternal Life of Goldman (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman_KEYART-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman. Image credit: Weappy Studio</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Weappy Studio's upcoming 2D platformer, The Eternal Life of Goldman, is arguably one of the most visually stunning upcoming games. Its art will remind you of Cuphead almost immediately, and if the platforming gameplay can match how good it looks, then this could be one of the surprising hits of 2026.</p>



<p>If it arrives in 2026, that is. There's currently no release window for it, but it appeared at multiple showcases in 2025. If it wasn't going to be ready to release soon, or at least if Weappy Studios didn't think it would be ready, we probably would have seen less of it. Hopefully, once 2026 begins, we'll start to see more of the game and get a proper release date. For now, we'll wait with baited breath.</p>



<h2 id="h-replaced-march-12-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Replaced (March 12, 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Replaced-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Official key art for Replaced. Image credit: Sad Cat Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sad Cat Studios has had a long road to the release of Replaced. When it was first showcased in 2021, it was one of the highlights of that year's Xbox show, and it immediately shot up to being one of the most highly anticipated indie games. At least, that was until <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">Russia's invasion of Ukraine interrupted its development</a>, and the game had to be delayed.</p>



<p>Now, it's due out on March 12, 2026, and it hasn't lost any of the lustre it had when it was shown in 2021. It still looks like it will be this incredible, cyberpunk adventure that leans on some gorgeous-looking pixel art and a deep narrative. Who knows if it will live up to those expectations, of course, but it's exciting to know that Sad Cat Studios is getting the chance to try.</p>



<h2 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire-march-19-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-xbox-one-nintendo-switch">MOUSE: P.I. For Hire (March 19, 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mouse-P.I.-For-Hire.png"></a><figcaption><em>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire. Image credit: Fumi Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once the original likeness of Mickey Mouse was old enough to be in the public domain, everyone knew that we had an onslaught of Mouse-adjacent projects coming our way. One of them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3094480/Bad_Cheese/">Bad Cheese</a>, was a first-person horror game that arrived in September 2025. Another, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, is a first-person shooter where you play as private investigator Jack Pepper in what looks like an eccentric and bombastic adventure.</p>



<p>It's another game on this list that has been a long time coming, since it was first revealed back in 2023. It even stars Troy Baker as the lead character. All together with its art, animation, gameplay, and narrative, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire could be one of 2026's top indie games when it arrives on March 19, 2026. </p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>2XKO</em>, it's a <em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game that includes characters from the celebrated MOBA.</p><p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3ec28b2-9e16-4ae6-a24a-11a8af39db67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in 2024</a> (well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b4d1a85-12a2-46e6-82af-d985715a9e5d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">officially, at any rate</a>), the game features characters like Illaoi, Yasuo, and Teemo, and new characters are being added over time, so if your favorite isn't in the game yet, they may well be introduced soon.</p><p>After being in development for some years, <em>2XKO </em>launched in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f9a82e6e-d1fa-4755-bf89-d3f786e17e74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in October last year</a>. It's free-to-play, so you can check it out without paying a penny if you want to, and presumably, the console releases will follow the same model.</p><p>The next champion to arrive in <em>2XKO </em>will be the sniper Caitlyn, and presumably, she'll be launching at the same time as the game does on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

<p><em>2XKO </em>is available to <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">play right now for free on PC</a>, and it'll presumably be hitting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on January 20th.

              <p>ChatGPT reportedly wants to put sponsored ads in your AI psychosis sessions. The League of Legends fighting game is almost out. And Pluribus’ Rhea Seehorn once <a href="https://x.com/rheangelseehorn/status/2006038032537805032">starred in a<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> tutorial CD-ROM</a> from Best Buy. It’s the last Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, for 2025. We’ll see you on the other side where more great gaming debates await like whether the myth of the “solo dev” should be retired for good or is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3mbbvyts6l72g">still a useful descriptor</a>. 2026 feels like the year we’ll finally get to the bottom of this, and so much more!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rhea Seehorn on her early role in the Magic the Gathering video game 🧙‍♀️ <a href="https://t.co/0knL13ppkc">pic.twitter.com/0knL13ppkc</a></p> <p>— 𝙧𝙝𝙚𝙖 𝙨𝙚𝙚𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙣 𝙛𝙖𝙣 (@rheangelseehorn) <a href="https://twitter.com/rheangelseehorn/status/2006038032537805032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>ChatGPT results could soon be manipulated by “sponsored” bots</h2> <p>That’s according to a new report <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-ads-push-starts-taking-shape">from <em>The Information</em></a> which points to conversations among some employees at OpenAI about how to inject ads into the popular bot querying platform. A hypothetical example includes asking for recommended ibuprofen dosages for headaches and being recommended an Advil ad instead. Basically, the shitty version of Google, except you have to pay a subscription to access it.</p>

 <p>“As ChatGPT becomes more capable and widely used, we’re looking at ways to continue offering more intelligence to everyone,” a spokesperson for OpenAI told <em>The Information</em> this month. “As part of this, we’re exploring what ads in our product could look like. People have a trusted relationship with ChatGPT, and any approach would be designed to respect that trust.”</p>

 <h2>The <em>League of Legends</em> fighting game arrives next month</h2> <p>A console release date of January 20 for <em>2XKO</em> was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/2xko-launches-january-20-2026">briefly leaked after a new trailer for the game went up on YouTube early</a>. Launched in early access on PC back in October, the full launch will see Riot Games’ free-to-play fighter arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as well.</p>

 <h2><em>River City Ransom: Underground</em> is about to disappear</h2> <p>The 2017 beat ’em up is set to be delisted from Steam at any moment now. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/422810">store page</a> has already lost all of its images and gameplay footage. “Due to the expiration of a licensing agreement, this game will be removed from sale on Steam,” the developer shared in a new update. “The delisting process is currently underway. <wbr>If you already own the game, nothing changes — it will remain available in your Steam Library, and you can continue to download and play as usual.”</p>

 <p>The <i>Kunio-kun</i> franchise is currently owned and overseen by Arc Systems.</p> <h2>Atlus isn’t rushing the next <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em></h2> <p>“When we initially set out to create this game, we had the ambitions of hoping to cultivate this game into one of our brands within Atlus, like a pillar,” director Katsura Hashino recently <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/refantazio-director-katsura-hashino">told <em>Game Informer</em></a>. “With that being said, just because we had a certain level of success, we don’t want to just jump on that and quickly put out something as a sequel.”</p>

 <p>He went on, “We want to really give it some thought and make sure that if we are able to continue on in this series, we’re putting together something that is building on the values that we were able to infuse into this game, and something that would be worthwhile for the fans that would be waiting for it.”</p>

 <h2>Geoff Keighley shares how the <em>Mega Man</em> reveal at The Game Awards 2025 came together</h2>   <p>“A few weeks later, I was at Capcom HQ in Osaka,” he wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5WvBMD8DA/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">on Instagram</a>. “The lights dimmed, the Mega Man theme played, and through the door walked Minamitani-san in a full Mega Man outfit, alongside Izumi-san, dressed as Dr. Wily. It was classic Capcom.</p> <p>Keighley continued, “We talked about their vision for the next Mega Man, and then they handed me a controller to play a very early ROM and give feedback. That’s when we began discussing how to reveal it to the world.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188">The state of the Switch 2 is good but not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nitnendo-switch-2-3ds-xl-used-ebay-prices-2000656110">3DS XL prices are through the roof</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/polymarket-betting-dota2-bot-trump-truth-predict-2000656106">Bots are making hundreds of thousands betting on esports thanks to Trump</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-wishlisting-games-on-switch-eshop-is-a-game-in-itself</link>
            <guid>1394863</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="ee3534a19a81f"><a title="Switch 2 eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee3534a19a81f/switch-2-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I love browsing the eShop, and the clicky sounds as you scroll across it.</p>
<p>The pleasing crispness of the <em>chick</em>! sound goes so well with the Joy-Con button feel. There’s that camera shutter <em>snap!</em> if you scroll across a game’s gallery in quick succession, and on Switch 2 there’s a thumb-cheek <em>pop!</em> when you hover over a 2-wide box. Genuinely, big fan.</p>
<p>It’s partly why I even liked OG eShop — or at least found it absorbing — with its weird Y2K modem lag every time you moved and that old-school anticipation of waiting for things to load or change, wondering <em>did I even press the button?</em> but not daring to re-press in case I did. You might overshoot!</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> like the new one better, obviously. Now nicely responsive as I scroll down the Coming Soon section with OCD completionism - <em>middle down, left right right left</em> (and the reverse obviously for the next line down, I don’t want to unbalance the universe) - <em>click click click</em>, and everything is tactile like digi-brail, everything touched like I'm thumbing across book spines. I think this is fun?</p>
<p>But even more fun (!) than all this is then adding things to my wishlist.</p>
<p>I don’t just add games I recognise and would like to buy or play, but — I’ve now realised — use it as a sort of scrapbook; of thumbnails I liked, weirdness I was intrigued by, a repository of ideas, nostalgia triggers, or more. The wishlist heart is my eShop ‘like’ button, and I try to not self-censor if something catches my eye (barring blatant anime boobs, etc).</p>
<figure data-uuid="d4f579bdc640c"><a title="Switch eShop Wishlisting Games 29" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d4f579bdc640c/switch-eshop-wishlisting-games-29.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Redblack Spade</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What can we learn from this silly habit, from the patterns and trends?</p>
<p>For one thing, I seem to really, <em>really</em> like hand-illustrated fantasy art overlain by serif font and a vaguely wistful title.</p>
<p>Why else would <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvestella">Harvestella</a> (bucolic name, tree in thumbnail), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trinity_trigger">Trinity Trigger</a> (illustrated artstyle, tree-adjacent thing in thumbnail) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/various_daylife">Various Daylife</a> (nonsensical/wholesome name, treeless thumbnail but appealing screenshot of characters walking through gamecube era grass-textures in gallery) be in my wishlist?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/star_ocean_the_second_story_r">Star Ocean R Hyper Turbo</a> (or something) has a gallery image of characters traipsing through a golden hour wheat field in pixel-grained glory, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/egglia_rebirth">Egglia</a> looks like an homage to the <strong>Legend of Mana</strong> style, the original website of which I used to hang out in just for its gorgeous pastel tones and Victorian-storybook style of fantasy illustration (<em>and trees</em>). I will not play any of these games.</p>
<p>In general, there’s lots of open-air adventure suggested by JRPG thumbnails. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a> (which I think is set in a kingdom of genetically thick-thighed females?) has been there for ages even though I played the demo and it was very not for me. But the image has a lovely pea-green sunset behind Yumia (?) in the classic rule of thirds and it doth please my eyes to roam across it.</p>

<p>Beyond fantasy, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/milkmaid_of_the_milky_way">Milkmaid of the Milky Way</a> has a lyrical title and evokes an old book cover, with its strangely proportioned golden ship and enough sky to suggest sci-fi scope. But I've now actually read the description for the first time ever and apparently it's about some Norwegian lass and rhyming couplets? Whatever, the cover is evocative enough to keep.</p>
<p>To be honest, I may actually play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/a_space_for_the_unbound">A Space for the Unbound</a>. But what about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_from_toyotoki_arrival_of_the_witch">Tales from Toyotoki: Arrival of the Witch</a>, with its bifurcated thumbnail that looks like a PowerPoint slide? Looking at the screenshots I can confirm I will not - it looks like a visual novel and so I worry it won’t have a jump button. But both give vaguely (or in the case of ASFTU, explicitly) Shinkai vibes of hanging out with cleanly drawn anime teens and spiritual themes in pristine urban evocations, and both use a blue-purple in their art and character outlines which looks lovely. (Also, ASFTU’s title writing is nicely aligned.)</p>

<p>Scrolling through my wishlist I also see unintended rhymes, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bahnsen_knights">Bahnsen Knights</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tenement">Tenement</a>, and now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bermuda_survivor">Bermuda Survivor</a> forming a trio of black backgrounds burst through with '80s-neon pop.</p>
<p>But let's go further, to things wishlisted <em>mainly</em> for their titles or phrases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/qualia_the_path_of_promise">Qualia</a> looks like a hentai game? There are certainly girls with improbable-looking breasts. But it's called 'Qualia', which an English professor once told me means the <em>whatness</em> of something (or something?) and transports me in time and space and perspective enough to add to the list. See also: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/room_of_depression">Room of Depression</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/looking_up_i_see_only_a_ceiling">Looking Up I See Only A Ceiling</a> (which is practically a poem in itself and actually looks pretty interesting).</p>
<p>Less lyrical are the ‘games’ I add because of their pleasing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7dx2Z9G7Mk">Ronseal-like directness</a>, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/easy_dice_for_rpgtabletop">Easy Dice for RPG/Tabletop - GOLD EDITION</a> (what makes it Gold-er though?!).</p>

<p>Others have legitimately good thumbnails a YouTuber would be proud of, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/car_parking_madness_school_drive_mechanic_car_games_simulator_2023">Car Parking Madness School Drive Mechanic Car Simulator 2023</a> - with its strange Pro/Noob arrows in the thumbnail for two different cars, both of which frankly look perfectly well parked. But there’s almost a question in the image, the tension of <em>wait, what?</em> The game has already started!</p>
<p>Some games I wishlist to preserve my baffled curiosity. Who exactly made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/america_wild_hunting">America Wild Hunting</a>, with its overexposed photo backgrounds and stock military <strong>MASH</strong>-style font and thumbnail of an eagle in crosshairs? Where do they live? What do they love (except hunting)?</p>
<p>And what exactly <em>is</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/about_an_elf">About An Elf</a> (which has been in my wishlist for ages as a sort of fringe outpost that broadens my impression of the gaming landscape), and why is the thigh-high riding face-painted woman riding an animal that looks like a polar bear shagged a ferret? Why are there gnomes? Did someone make this out of passion? Art? These are questions that provoke the soul, so I guess just the <em>page</em> is art. Get on the wishlist.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gorsd">GORSD</a> might be one of my favourite thumbnails, of a disconcerting goat-head smiling a human-teethed grimace no one could love.</p>
<p>Nicely, the game’s vibe actually lived up to this strangeness — I do actually <em>buy</em> games, too — though I could never get the hang of the play proper. The surrealism was worth the coffee price, enough to keep it on the list even though I’ve bought the game, though the wish has been granted.</p>
<p>Indeed, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyond_good_and_evil_20th_anniversary_edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil Anniversary Edition</a> I’ll wishlist partly with some vague intention to one day replay it, but mainly because I already know it and love it and enjoy the shorthand associations of seeing the cover thumbnail.</p>
<p>Whereas I've never got round to looking up what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/what-is-eggconsole-full-game-list-pc-88-msx2-on-nintendo-switch-best-games-to-start">EGGCONSOLE games</a> <em>are</em>, and don’t really want to just yet. Instead, I get to enjoy the uncollapsed Schrödinger potential energy, the ongoing mystery.</p>
<p>Also, did you know there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chubby_cat_2">Chubby Cat</a> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chubby_cat_2">2</a></em>?</p>
<figure data-uuid="5951a3ddf07d4"><a title="Switch eShop Wishlisting Games 17" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5951a3ddf07d4/switch-eshop-wishlisting-games-17.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Springloaded</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The point is, I love all this, my own skewed-kaleidoscope of gaming paraphernalia, of images and words and those big background-colour changes on pages with galleries I can scroll through with face buttons and 'R'/'L' clicks.</p>
<p>It reminds me a little of a mispent youth poring over video game magazines and experiencing most games as things described, screenshotted, mysterious allusions instead of things I actually played. An ecosystem of enthusiasm built as much from the discourse and the depiction as the game itself, and a hobby that was also a portal into different worlds and art styles and ideas.</p>
<p>Would it be a stretch to call eShop browsing a 'game', this engaging thing done with pad in hand?</p>




<p>Maybe I should just get Instagram.</p>

              <p>A great pair of headphones can completely transform the way you experience your favorite music.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 has been another big year for gaming, and while the past 12 months have been headlined by huge releases and major updates to existing titles, there’s also been a slew of weird moments.</p>



<p>Take a trip down memory lane with Insider Gaming to take a look at the weirdest gaming moments from 2025, and don’t forget to share yours!</p>



<h2 id="h-2025-s-weirdest-gaming-moments">2025’s Weirdest Gaming Moments</h2>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-s-attack-on-titan-crossover">Assassin’s Creed’s Attack On Titan Crossover</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Weird duo. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bringing the world of Attack On Titan into the Assassin’s Creed universe was always going to be a weird choice, and it became even weirder when players actually got their hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-x-attack-on-titan-crossover-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, which went viral for all the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>Some of the screenshots shared on social media following the release of the limited-time quest were harrowing, and there were plenty of annoyances around both the disappointing content introduced and the fact that it was only available to complete for an extremely small period of time.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite-s-darth-vader-ai">Fortnite’s Darth Vader AI</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Force Unleashed. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in May, coinciding with the annual Star Wars day, the huge Disney franchise once again launched a collab with Fortnite, bringing new content, characters, skins, and more into the Epic Games title during a dedicated mini-season, which also featured Darth Vader as a recruitable ally, with AI interaction using the actual voice of James Earl Jones.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take a genius to predict where an AI-voice for an iconic character would go wrong, and it wasn’t too long until players found ways to avoid Epic Games’ restrictions entirely, leading to viral slips where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-darth-vader-fortnite-slurs-epic-patching-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vader engaged in inflammatory language</a> and controversial situations.</p>



<p>Epic Games hasn’t brought back a similar AI character since, and it’s clear that major improvements are needed if the idea is to be revisited.</p>



<h3 id="h-mindseye-s-messy-release">Mindseye’s Messy Release</h3>

<p>Gamers were hoping that Mindseye would present a Grand Theft Auto alternative, particularly following the latest delay in GTA 6, and Mindseye, on paper at least, looked like it could potentially fill that void for a bit. However, not only did Mindseye fall way short of that mark, but it ended up being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s worst games</a>.</p>



<p>Criticism was directed at all areas of the game, with game-breaking bugs present, a sub-par storyline, unjoyable characters, and more all receiving the brunt of those criticisms, and things took an even weirder turn when Build A Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard claimed on Discord that the negative reception was part of a third-party campaign to make a “concerted effort to trash the game and the studio.”</p>

<p>One player enjoying the world of Grand Theft Auto 5 had a much more realistic experience than they could have ever anticipated, after a car evading police crashed into a woman’s house while she herself was trying to escape the cops in the game.</p>



<p>Emma Graves detailed the terrifying experience to the <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/leeds-woman-petitions-for-safety-measures-on-residential-road-in-armley-after-car-crashes-into-flat-5320663">Yorkshire Eve</a><a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/leeds-woman-petitions-for-safety-measures-on-residential-road-in-armley-after-car-crashes-into-flat-5320663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/leeds-woman-petitions-for-safety-measures-on-residential-road-in-armley-after-car-crashes-into-flat-5320663">ing Post</a>, saying the incident was “just so ironic” and she “literally couldn’t” make it up. While it wasn’t funny at the time, as the crash occurred inches away from where she was playing, she’s found the humorous side since.</p>



<h3 id="h-make-fps-great-again">Make FPS Great Again</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Controversial. Image via Summer Games Fest</figcaption></figure>



<p>At Summer Games Fest, 1047 co-founder Ian Proulx took to the stage to promote Splitgate 2 bizarrely, wearing a cap that read “Make FPS Great Again” and calling out Call of Duty directly with his comments. Both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incidents sparked controversy</a> and stirred up quite an aftermath, though Proulx insisted the cap, which mimicked Donald Trump’s infamous presidential election catchphrase, was not a political statement.</p>



<p>The irony is that Splitgate 2 far from achieved any goal of making the FPS genre “great again,” with Metacritic reviews narrowly seeing the title edge out the much-maligned Black Ops 7, and being way adrift of Battlefield 6. If any title made FPS’ great again, it was undoubtedly Battlefield.</p>



<h3 id="h-miss-piggy-amp-geoff-keighley-flirting">Miss Piggy &amp; Geoff Keighley Flirting</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Uncomfortable. Image via The Game Awards</figcaption></figure>



<p>At The Game Awards, the on-stage flirting between Geoff Keighley and Miss Piggy was a fever dream, particularly for those in areas of the world in time zones that saw the event take place in the middle of the night, and it’s fair to say that Kermit the Frog would not approve of the incidents.</p>



<p>Seeing an iconic Muppets character engaging in the flirting was weird enough, but seeing Keighley reciprocate made for uncomfortable viewing.</p>







<figure><figcaption>What the Duck? Image via Team Soda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Escape From Duckov may sound like the sort of weird advertisement for a mobile game you’d find appearing mid-video on YouTube, but not only was it a major launch, it actually became one of the most successful titles of the year, adding a further feather in the cap of the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Millions of players across the world</a> splashed out to purchase Escape From Duckov, with the game also boasting a strong audience in China, and it sits with overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-literal-peanut-shining-on-the-streaming-stage">A Literal Peanut Shining on The Streaming Stage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Nutty. Image via Twitch</figcaption></figure>



<p>The world of streaming has often been weird and wonderful, though things took an even stranger turn in 2025 with the emergence and huge reach of TheBurntPeanut, who boasts over 1 million followers on Twitch and is closing in on that mark on YouTube, too.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut was also an award winner in 2025, taking home the prize for the Best VTuber at the Streamer Awards, sparking some controversy in the VTuber community. Overall, it showed the weird and wonderful world of streaming, providing evidence that even a humble snack can rise to the top.</p>



<h3 id="h-gamestop-s-staplegate">GameStop’s Staplegate</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Odd. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>GameStop can’t escape the headlines and controversy, regularly causing a stir in 2025, but by far the biggest blowup was Staplegate after the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, with GameStop stapling receipts to the console’s box, in some cases causing damage to the screen.</p>



<p>One of the Staplegate copies of the Switch 2 console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestops-switch-2-stapler-sells-for-250000-at-auction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold for six figures on eBay</a>, because of course it did, and the whole incident really puts the claims that there is no such thing as bad press to the test.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Pushing RTX 5090 Prices to $5000 in 2026, Rumor Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1394851</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ongoing impact of artificial intelligence’s growth could be felt even more acutely by PC gamers in 2026, according to a new rumor. It has been claimed that next year, NVIDIA will increase the prices of the RTX 5090 GPU to as much as $5,000 for a <strong>single unit</strong>. It has been suggested that price increases will start rolling out from January onwards.</p>



<p>NVIDIA isn’t alone in the pricing boom. In a recent report from a South Korean outlet, it was claimed that sources close to the technology have stressed AMD will also be boosting price tags on its highest-tier GPUs.</p>







<h2 id="h-gpu-prices-are-about-to-get-ridiculous">GPU Prices Are About To Get Ridiculous</h2>



<p>It’s easy to see the cost of top-tier GPUs soaring through 2026 when you look at how much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/">RAM costs have skyrocketed</a> through 2025. The construction of AI-fed data centers and the technology backbone to support the growing vertical have absolutely shattered the hardware market in the last few months, but we’re not out of the woods yet.</p>



<p>In a recent claim <a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Newsis</a>, a South Korean outlet, it was stressed that we’re just seeing the beginning of monumental and borderline ridiculous price hikes in the GPU space.</p>



<p>The report explained that sources have suggested a climb in the RTX 5090 stakes from $1,999 at launch this year to as much as $5,000 later in 2026. AMD’s RX 9000 series is apparently set to mimic that ticket growth, but not as steeply.</p>



<p>It was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Both companies are reportedly planning to continue raising GPU prices every month going forward. It’s highly likely that the price increases will extend across their entire product lineup, encompassing not only consumer GPUs but also GPUs for AI data centers and servers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report then noted a quote from an ‘insider’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The average proportion of memory in the overall GPU manufacturing cost has recently exceeded 80%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, this situation is having an impact on all areas of technology. Recent concerns surfaced regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/">development of the PlayStation 6</a>, the cellphone space is getting shaky, and RAM prices reached an all-time high in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s likely going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/845401/nintendo-switch-2-best-games</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>2025 was a big year for gaming, and that includes gaming hardware. Nintendo launched its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> console in June, and since then, numerous Switch 2 titles and noteworthy updates for original Switch games have launched. These include brand-new Nintendo experiences like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, as well as some belated but welcome third-party titles, including <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>. Even classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> got some new life on the upgraded console.</p><p>If you’re considering buying a console, or you’re getting one for someone else, there are 11 games that we think are a must-buy for any Switch 2 owner.</p><p>So what if <em>Mario Kart World</em> comes in the box with the $499 Switch 2 bundle? It’s still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">so easy to recommend</a> because few other games match the briskness at which it just lets you get going and have fun. The latest entry in Nintendo’s top-selling racing franchise adds many new characters, an open-world single-player mode, unique interconnected courses, and a lot more.</p><p>One of the best ways to play the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> was on a Nintendo Switch, so it’s no surprise that the Switch 2 is a great way to enjoy the long-awaited sequel, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a></em>. The side-scrolling action exploration game looks fantastic, and its gorgeous animations are easier to appreciate thanks to the console’s 120Hz refresh rate screen.</p><div><p id="divinity-original-sin-2"><h2><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em></h2></p></div><p>Before Larian Studios made <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834516/baldurs-gate-3-choices-narrative-perfectionism">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></em>, it was best known for its <em>Divinity </em>series. The developers recently announced a reboot of the RPG franchise, but for now, the closest thing to <em>BG3 </em>that Switch 2 owners can experience right now is <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, a fantastic RPG that first launched in late 2017. It just got a free Switch 2 update that enhances visuals and reduces slowdown, and I highly recommend playing it.</p><p>The team that developed <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> clearly had a ball with its most recent game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>. It’s just as ambitious in terms of level design, giving Donkey Kong several unique powers of transformation. But it’s significantly more destructive, letting him demolish everything in sight with his fists or punch through the ground to get around obstacles.</p><div><p id="cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition"><h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em></h2></p></div><p>You know Nintendo did something right with the Switch 2 when the graphics showcase <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> shows up as a launch game. The first-person-shooter-meets-RPG plays well on the system, especially when you use the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode, which makes it feel a bit like the PC version. This version of the game includes the excellent <em>Phantom Liberty</em> DLC that adds even more action, plus Idris Elba.</p><p>After nearly a decade in development, the first new <em>Metroid Prime</em> game in nearly 20 years is now available for the Switch 2. It runs at glorious 4K on the new hardware (or up to 120 frames per second in 1080p), but beyond looks, it’s great to be back in Samus Aran’s butt-kicking boots again. This time, she’s got the Vi-O-La motorcycle for getting around the desert terrain that connects the main dungeons. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">story and exploration may not have the same magic as the original <em>Prime</em></a>, but its best parts are still worth paying the price of admission to experience.</p><div><p id="splatoon-3"><h2><em>Splatoon 3</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> was already a fun game on the original Switch, but it’s even better with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686128/splatoon-3-switch-2-update-overview">free Switch 2 update</a>. With faster loading speeds and better-looking visuals, you owe it to yourself to make a splashy mess in its fun single-player campaign and online multiplayer modes.</p><div><p id="the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"><h2><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></h2></p></div><p>The release of the Switch 2 made old things new again. For example, the original Switch launch title <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> has never looked or played better than it does in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">new Switch 2 Edition</a>, which costs $10 if you own the Switch game or $70 by itself (the upgrade is free if you have Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Faster frame rates, speedier loading times, better visuals, and a GPS-style mobile app feature make this one feel like a breath of fresh air.</p><div><p id="red-dead-redemption"><h2><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></h2></p></div><p>Rockstar Games’ open-world Western was late to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834520/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-hands-on">hit the original Switch</a>, but the new (and free) Switch 2 update makes it shine in some surprising ways. Not only does it boost the visuals and performance thanks to the new console’s more powerful specs, it adds a PC-like mouse mode to make it much easier to aim (and more fun to play).</p><div><p id="no-mans-sky"><h2><em>No Man’s Sky</em></h2></p></div><p>If you’ve never played <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update">No Man’s Sky</a></em>, can we switch brains so I can experience it again for the first time? The space exploration game with an infinite universe (made possible via procedural generation that makes each player’s experience unique) is one of gaming’s biggest success stories in recent years. The developers pile on numerous substantive updates each year, making this an excellent game to play, whether you want to chill or engage in building a space empire. Oh, and the Switch 2 update is free for those who own the base game.</p><div><p id="fortnite"><h2><em>Fortnite</em></h2></p></div><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite">Fortnite</a> </em>is the only game on this list that’s free to play, but that doesn’t make it one that you should pass up. Epic Games’ battle royale-style shooter is a cultural juggernaut that includes characters representing a huge array of fandoms. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on">The Switch 2 port makes it feel like an entirely different game</a> than the original Switch version. You can drop in as a character from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, lock and load as your favorite family member from <em>The Simpsons</em>, or assume the role of Sabrina Carpenter or Kim Kardashian, to name some of the literally dozens of tie-ins that are fun to see in-game.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845401/nintendo-switch-2-best-games]]></content:encoded>

<p>As gamers enter an all-new year, they’re looking forward to big releases, massive reveals, and of course, a slew of free games handed to them from subscription services like PS Plus. In a recent post, the first PS Plus game of January 2026 was revealed, and it’s coming in just a few days.</p>



<p>Fans of high-octane racing titles with an arcade twist will be pleased with what’s coming first to PS Plus in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-need-for-speed-unbound-coming-to-ps-plus">Need for Speed: Unbound Coming to PS Plus</h2>



<p>In a new post from Dealabs, it was leaked that the first game headed to PS Plus in January 2026 is Need for Speed: Unbound. It’ll be added to the PS Plus service from Tuesday, January 6th at 9 AM GMT.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-vous-revele-le-premier-jeu-du-mois-de-lannee-2026-60812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs report</a>, Need for Speed: Unbound will be available across all tiers of PS Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. It’s not yet clear what the ‘other two titles’ are that will join the service at the same time.</p>



<p>Need for Speed: Unbound was released in 2022 and stands as the most recent iteration in the popular racing series. It secured a Metascore of 77, which is regarded as ‘Generally Favorable’, so it should be a nice addition to the PlayStation Plus service.</p>



<p>We recently published a guide showcasing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-games-you-must-play-on-playstation-plus-released-in-2025/">top PS Plus titles</a> on the service released in 2025 that you <strong>need </strong>to play. No racing games found a spot on the list, unfortunately. It did feature the likes of God of War: Ragnarok, Red Dead Redemption, and Alan Wake 2, though.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to install Need for Speed: Unbound when it lands on PS Plus in January 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the first-person shooter space, fans of the two titans, Call of Duty and Battlefield, have found themselves up in arms again. This time, it’s over accusations that Electronic Arts has ‘blatantly copied’ Call of Duty art from days gone by, releasing a new Battlefield 6 skin that is eerily reminiscent of 2013’s Call of Duty Ghosts.</p>



<p>The latest Battlefield Pro battle pass contains a skin with a balaclava that’s admittedly walking the line between ‘inspired by’ and ‘pure replication’. Check it out below.</p>







<h2 id="h-did-electronic-arts-plagiarise-call-of-duty-ghosts">Did Electronic Arts Plagiarise Call of Duty Ghosts?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been in the Battlefield 6 space of late, you might have noticed the new Battlefield Pro battle pass drop that contains, amongst other things, the ‘Objective Ace’ skin.</p>



<p>If you were also around during 2013 and enjoyed Call of Duty Ghosts, you might have spotted something that doesn’t look right.</p>



<p>The Objective Ace skin for the Assault class has a balaclava that’s almost a stitch-for-stitch copy of the iconic ‘Ghosts’ balaclava from the 2013 Call of Duty game of the same name.</p>



<p>Here’s a comparison image of the two graphics side-by-side for you to make up your own mind:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On social media, fans were quick to draw comparisons with bright red arrows and circles, pointing out some of the obvious similarities. For instance, the ‘spiking’ of the skull to the base of the image, the ‘craack’ across the lower half of the skull, and the ‘chip’ above the right eyebrow.</p>



<p>It’s not <strong>identical</strong>, but it’s damn close, and that’s why fans have issues with this particular skin.</p>



<p>It’s difficult <strong>not </strong>to see the resemblance, but perhaps there are only so many ways you can represent a faded, scuffed, and worn skull motif on a balaclava. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Battlefield 6 team came under fire on December 21 for using what was believed to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">AI-generated art</a> for new sticker bundles. It’s not getting better, is it?</p>







<p>Do you think the Battlefield Pro balaclava is too close to the Call of Duty Ghosts art to be acceptable? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

		<p>As we venture into the final hours of the year, and with some parts of the world are already sneaking into the next, it’s time to reveal our overall <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-of-the-year-2025">Game of the Year 2025</a> winner!</p>
<p>We’ve been doling out awards for a whole host of categories, from looking at our favourite visuals, audio, and narratives of the year, to breaking games out into their genres, including a new run-based Roguelike category. For the overall winner, the favourites and front runners would have been obvious to see from the off, but who comes out on top?</p>
<p>We’re highlighting the top three, as usual, but our winner is…</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei</a> has climbed to the top of the mountain to claim our Overall Game of the Year Award 2025, and for good reason. Sucker Punch’s follow up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tshushima</a> is stronger in every way from the story, the combat, but most importantly the world. Ghost of Yotei’s open world of Ezo is one that is crafted so well that it invites you to explore, and you accept that invitation willingly.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch has crafted an environment where exploration is signalled by clues within the environment, like trees covered in flowers, and smoke on the horizon tapping into your curiosity. Ghost of Yotei’s world is made stronger by having a variety of environments to explore across its regions, each hiding its own dangers and secrets. The world itself is inhabited by interesting characters that weave in and out of Atsu’s story, be it through the mainline path, side missions, and even the bounty hunts that feed into the overall narrative.</p>
<p>As I said in my Ghost of Yōtei review, “This is a truly worthy successor to Ghost of Tsushima.” And the journey is not over with the Legends content coming in 2026 that will draw so many of us back to Ezo’s shores.</p>
<p><em>– Aran</em></p>
<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is just a beautiful game. It begins strong, with an irresistibly intriguing setup: in a fractured world where Paris sits upon one of few islands amidst the chaos an unravelling world, the Paintress, a giant with long hair covering her face, sits beside a monolith with the number 34 on it. She erases the number and replaces it with 33, and everyone of that age fades into oblivion. Another in a long line of expeditions readies itself to try and destroy her, including Gustave, whose long lost love just turned into smoke and flower petals. It’s just as strange and mysterious right up until the very end.</p>
<p>It’s not just story and setting, though. There’s also an intricate turn-based combat system that, when harnessed properly, can make you feel very powerful indeed. All of the characters play completely differently as well, each one a completely new playstyle to fiddle around with, but each as potentially strong as the other. On top of that, there’s a parry and dodge system, allowing you to pull victory from the jaws of defeat by ably parrying and countering if you’re good enough. Whilst it may be challenging to read the fiendishly deceptive attack animations, successfully countering a combo of six attacks is at least satisfying enough to be worth it. Clair Obscur is a remarkable achievement for such a small studio and remains one of biggest surprises and one of best games of the year.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Hades 2 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>One hundred and three. That’s the number of times I’ve commenced a run in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/hades-2-review/">Hades 2</a>, either sending the magic-spell concocting Melinoë on a descent to the dark-depths of the underworld, or having her travel across the surface to clamber atop Mount Olympus. Just like the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>, the combat remains crisp, responsive and utterly beguiling; it’s a hectic action-packed thrill-ride of a game, yet you never lose the ability to tell what’s going on despite the onscreen fireworks. In fact, even with the many roguelite imitators over the intervening years, none of the emulators have been able to achieve this perfect balance of spectacle and nuance. It took the return of Supergiant Games to show the rest how it’s done.</p>
<p>What impresses even more, is how that, after some fifty hours into the game, it’s still introducing brilliant new mechanics, fascinating new characters and entirely new storylines to me. Talk about confidence, Supergiant Games saved a lot of the best stuff until tens of hours after the end credits rolled.</p>
<p>My final point as to why Hades 2 is well deserving a place on the GOTY podium; it offers an absolutely perfect interpretation of the larger-than-life icons of Ancient Greek mythology, exploring the volatile relationships between gods, heroes and monsters. It’s a masterclass in bringing new life to ancient mythology.</p>
<p>How do Supergiant Games do it?</p>
<p><em>– Ade</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>And that’s a wrap for our Game of the Year 2025 awards. Congratulations to our winners across the board – we will be keenly watching what comes next from all of these teams!&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Speaking of which, next up we have our Most Wanted lists, looking at the games we’re most excited to see through 2026.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"><strong>2025 has been a great year for role-playing games</strong></a>, and 2026 is setting out to be another incredible year for one of the most popular gaming genres around. While next year won't see the release of many new properties, 2026 will see the <strong>return of some beloved series</strong>, with new entries in their respective franchises as well as <strong>remakes that breathe new life</strong> in all time classics.</p>



<p>Here are the <strong>five RPGs</strong> officially confirmed for a 2026 launch that we feel deserve your attention the most at this point in time.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-3-february-6-2026-pc-playstation-5">Nioh 3 (February 6, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nioh-3.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>With its open-field mechanics and tight combat, Nioh 3 is one of the most anticipated RPGs launching in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Following games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,</strong></em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Rise of the Ronin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Team NINJA</strong>&nbsp;is finally returning to the series that has defined the studio's course since 2017: the&nbsp;<strong>Nioh series</strong>.</span></p>



<p>Unlike <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh 2</a></strong></em>, which refined the formula of its predecessor, bringing it to heights that made it rival FromSoftware games in terms of mechanical complexity, <strong>Nioh 3</strong> is set to provide a brand new experience with the introduction of <strong>open-fields</strong> that will provide a more involving way of engaging with the game's world inspired by different time periods in Japan, including the <strong>Sengoku and Bakumatsu eras</strong>.</p>



<p>This open-field approach, however, won't water down the mechanics that define the Nioh series. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">With the introduction of&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">two fighting styles - Samurai and Ninja - </strong>new mechanics inspired by other games developed by the studio, and a challenging, uncompromising experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;is set to become one of the&nbsp;best games by Team NINJA, if not the very best.</a></strong></span></p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-february-5-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined (February 5, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will bring the seventh entry in the series to a whole new audience in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-new-information/"><strong><em>Dragon Quest XII</em> is nowhere to be seen</strong></a>, the popular JRPG franchise hasn't been dormant. Over the past couple of years, the first three entries in the series received excellent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">HD-2D makeovers</a></strong>, which will be followed this year by a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">full-on remake of Dragon Quest VII</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Although the seventh entry in the series was already remade on Nintendo 3DS, <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> is set to become the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"><strong>overhauling everything from visuals to gameplay.</strong></a> With its <strong>beautiful handcrafted artstyle and diorama environments</strong>, a streamlined story experience which aims at <strong>trimming the original's very long story</strong>, new scenarios focused on the Hero, Maribel and Keifer, an <strong>improved Vocations system</strong> with the ability to equip two Vocations per character, new spells and skills for an enhanced battle experience, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> promises to deliver the <strong>prime turn-based JRPG experience in 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to make the long wait for <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> more bearable? We will find out this February.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">The Blood of Dawnwalker (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Blood-of-Dawnwalker-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In early 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that former <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> director <strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong> had founded a new studio called <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong>. Later that year, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>NetEase</strong> had provided an investment to create a new <strong>triple-A RPG</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to be titled <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong>. Their game is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being published</a> by <strong>Bandai Namco</strong>, though, which is why NetEase's move to pull back from many Western studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-isnt-in-any-danger-despite-netease-involvement-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not affect Rebel Wolves</a>.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker clearly borrows a lot from the framework of The Witcher III (which is only a great thing, as that is one of the finest open world RPGs ever made), but it also adds a few key innovations, such as the fact that there is essentially no difference between main and side quests. The protagonist, Coen, <strong>has 30 days to save his family</strong>; how to reach that goal is entirely up to the player. Tackling specific objectives is radically different during the day, when Coen is human, and at nighttime, when his vampiric abilities manifest. Because of these elements, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-freedom-closer-to-fallout-1-2-pen-paper-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> its role-playing freedom was <strong>inspired by pen-and-paper games</strong>.</p>



<p>Its setting and peculiar twist on vampire lore, with them actually coming out in the open and ruling the Carpathians-inspired Vale Sangora, is also intriguing. For more on The Blood of Dawnwalker, check out <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our exclusive interview with Creative Director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz</a></strong> from Gamescom 2025.  </p>



<h2 id="h-control-resonant-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">CONTROL Resonant (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Control-Resonant.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>CONTROL Resonant is a major shake-up of its predecessor's formula that will deliver Remedy Entertainment's most ambitious experience to date</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/"><strong>a brilliant action-adventure title</strong></a>, <strong>Remedy</strong> is taking a <strong>"not-so-safe" approach</strong> for the sequel. <strong>CONTROL Resonant</strong> officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/"><strong>shifts the series into full-fledged action RPG territory</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Seven years after the original, the lockdown on the Oldest House has collapsed, and the <strong>paranatural chaos</strong> has spilled out into a <strong>quarantined, "open-ended" Manhattan</strong>. Stepping into the shoes of Jesse’s brother, <strong>Dylan Faden</strong>, players will have to fight this new reality-warping threat with the help of the <strong>Aberrant</strong>, a brutal, shapeshifting melee weapon that pairs with expanded psychic abilities.</p>



<p>With a heavy focus on <strong>build-crafting</strong>, varied enemy types that can match your mobility, and a <strong>meticulously authored version of New York City</strong>, <em>CONTROL Resonant</em> looks to be <strong>Remedy's most ambitious project to date</strong>, and one of the most interesting action RPGs to launch in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fable-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Fable (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fable-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It was early 2018 when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-game-confirmed-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard the first rumors</a> that <strong>Playground Games</strong> had decided to accept the arduous task of rebooting the long-dormant <strong>Fable</strong> series. The game itself was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, but it quickly became clear that it still had a long road ahead of its release. In 2022, a former Playground developer who worked on the project's early stages <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-progress-slow-playground-lack-of-rpg-experience-frugal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the studio's lack of experience with role-playing games and their frugal approach to development were slowing down progress.</p>



<p>Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-first-gameplay-xbox-games-showcase-richard-ayoade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2023</a> with an in-game trailer that featured actor <strong>Richard Ayoade</strong>, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2024</a> with a trailer that featured actor <strong>Matt King</strong> as well as some gameplay. More importantly, that trailer came with a promise of a <strong>2025 launch</strong>, which of course did not happen. In February 2025, Xbox Studios head <strong>Craig Duncan</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game required additional development time and was thus <strong>delayed until 2026</strong>, accompanied by some promising new gameplay footage.</p>



<p>There has been no further news from the studio. A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Fable might not even make it next year, although for now, there's no solid evidence to confirm that. As such, we remain hopeful in a 2026 release. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, 2026 is poised to be a fantastic year for role-playing games, and selecting only five titles proved to be a daunting task. Below are several more notable titles that are expected to make waves in the next 12 months.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="481">LEGO is one of the rare brands to resonate across generations. Its sets function equally well as a thoughtful gift, a collectible display piece, a rewarding personal project, or a toy to be played with. Beyond the finished model, there is genuine enjoyment in the building process itself—setting on a podcast or music, following the instructions step by step, and watching a creation gradually take shape. The experience is inherently mindful and calming. You get a brief escape from everyday stress as your focus shifts to assembling something tangible. Plus, LEGO’s extensive range of licensed sets spans countless popular franchises, so odds are your favorite character across media has taken LEGO form at least once or twice.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="481">Star Wars stands out as one of LEGO’s most enduring and celebrated collaborations. This here LEGO Star Wars Jango Fett helmet set is a refined display model created for adult fans. Designed for builders aged 18 and over, this set pays tribute to the Star Wars galaxy’s most iconic bounty hunter… ‘s dad. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6621/">For a limited time, Amazon has the LEGO Star Wars Jango Fett on sale for 20% off. That brings the price down from $70 to just $56 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s no question about it: 2025 has been a standout year for video games. From massive AAA blockbusters to boundary-pushing indie gems, the release calendar has been stacked with quality, and many titles have earned widespread critical praise.</p>



<p>With the year drawing to a close, it’s the perfect moment to reflect on its strongest launches. This list is based solely on Metascore ratings from Metacritic. To qualify, a game must have been released in 2025 to <strong>over 25 critic reviews</strong>—apologies to The Legend of Zelda; as great as you are on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we want new games, not ports.</p>







<p>If you’re searching for the cream of the crop, here are the ten highest-rated video games that released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-highest-rated-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Highest Rated Games Released In 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-10-monster-hunter-wilds">10. Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Just another day out in the Wilds. Image by Capcom.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter franchise</a> hardly needs an introduction. Venture through sprawling environments, craft and wield powerful weapons, and take down towering beasts—all in pursuit of better gear and ever-greater challenges. It’s a formula that has defined the series for years, and for good reason: it’s endlessly satisfying.</p>



<p>Capcom has long perfected this loop, and Monster Hunter Wilds showcases the series at its very best. It’s also the most approachable entry to date, making it an ideal starting point for newcomers. Whether you’re a veteran hunter or someone curious about diving in for the first time, Wilds stands tall as the newest and most impressive evolution of the franchise.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">9. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take a trip back to medieval Europe. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>It’s easy for early-year releases to slip from memory—especially in a stacked year like 2025—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> refuses to be forgotten. Its remarkable immersion and gripping atmosphere have kept it firmly in the spotlight, resonating with critics right through to the year’s end.</p>



<p>Nearly every aspect of the game is executed with exceptional polish. The cutscenes, writing, visuals, and core gameplay all stand as shining examples of what a modern RPG can strive to be. If you’re a fan of rich, grounded storytelling paired with deeply engaging, authentic gameplay, then this is one 2025 release you absolutely shouldn’t overlook.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-dispatch">8. Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Up there with the Telltale greats. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>Dispatch may not have launched with the same blockbuster buzz as some of 2025’s heavy hitters, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly made a name for itself</a>, as it settles in as one of the highest-rated games of the year. AdHoc Studio’s episodic adventure blends sharp writing with a clever superhero twist, placing you in the role of Robert Robertson III—a former hero now managing crises from behind the scenes as a dispatcher. </p>



<p>If you thought the gameplay was reminiscent of Telltale games of old, then you’d be right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-dispatch-adhoc-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AdHoc is made up of former Telltale veterans</a>, and Dispatch proudly channels that lineage with its branching choices, punchy character dialogue, and narrative-driven pacing. Each episode plays out as a slick animated series brought to life, backed by strong performances and confident direction. It’s tightly crafted, consistently entertaining, and a standout reminder of how impactful choice-based storytelling can be.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">7. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Kojima at his best. Image by Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>There are few creators in the industry with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vision as distinctive as Hideo Kojima’s</a>, and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach might be his most striking showcase yet. At a glance, it may appear to be another atmospheric delivery-focused “walking sim,” sending players across sweeping landscapes with cargo in tow—but that surface-level read barely scratches the depth beneath. The sequel expands on the original’s foundations with richer mechanics, broader exploration, and a renewed emphasis on improvisation and survival.</p>



<p>At its core, Kojima once again crafts a story about human connection and the lengths we go to forge and maintain it. Every mechanic, from traversal to cargo management, serves a narrative purpose, reinforcing the themes woven throughout the journey. Combined with an exceptional cast delivering some of the year’s strongest performances, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> lands as one of 2025’s most affecting and ambitious releases.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-hollow-knight-silksong">6. Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The wait didn’t disappoint. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 90</strong></p>



<p>There were stretches over the past few years when it genuinely felt like the long-awaited sequel to Hollow Knight might never arrive. Team Cherry maintained an unwavering silence that became almost mythical in its own right, leaving fans to wonder if Silksong would remain a dream rather than a reality. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But when it finally launched</a>, the wait proved more than worthwhile—Silksong didn’t just meet expectations, it shattered them.</p>



<p>What makes the game so remarkable is how confidently it elevates every facet of the original. Movement and combat are faster, smoother, and more expressive than ever, giving Hornet a distinct identity that feels both familiar and thrillingly new. The world is richer and more atmospheric, the story deeper, and the level design more ambitious in scope. Silksong accomplishes what many believed impossible: it meaningfully improves on Hollow Knight, delivering an adventure that stands as one of the year’s defining triumphs and a masterclass in Metroidvania design.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-donkey-kong-bananza">5. Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>On the hunt for Bananas! Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Fans had been hoping for a Super Mario Odyssey sequel ever since the Switch classic was first released, but Nintendo ultimately had a different vision in mind. Donkey Kong Bonanza arrived as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananzas-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritual successor rather than a direct follow-up</a>—a game that channels Odyssey’s spirit while carving out its own bold identity.</p>







<p>What’s immediately clear is that it’s unapologetically a Donkey Kong adventure. The refined elegance of Mario is swapped for DK’s heavier, more powerful movement, giving the platforming a satisfyingly weighty feel. Yet the team didn’t abandon the fluidity that made Odyssey such a modern platforming masterpiece. Instead, they built upon it, designing levels with verticality, momentum, and environmental interaction tailored perfectly to DK’s strengths. The result is a vibrant, imaginative, and fiercely inventive 3D platformer, one that proudly stands as one of the best the genre has seen in years, and one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-split-fiction">4. Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hatch your very own dragons. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Hazelight Studios has practically redefined what co-op gaming can look like, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-is-on-course-to-outsell-it-takes-twos-20-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> carries that torch with confidence. It’s a game built entirely around collaboration—so much so that playing it solo is downright impossible. Its enforced teamwork isn’t a gimmick but one of its greatest strengths, pushing players to communicate, coordinate, and experience every moment together.</p>



<p>Even beyond its co-op brilliance, Split Fiction is an exceptional piece of game design. The sheer variety on display is astonishing: one moment you’re soaring across a fantasy realm atop a dragon, and the next you’re tearing through a neon sci-fi setting on a high-speed motorbike. Each sequence feels fresh, inventive, and packed with personality. It’s wild, imaginative, and endlessly entertaining.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-blue-prince">3. Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll never stop exploring. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Blue Prince emerged as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s standout indie hits</a>, offering a clever blend of mystery, strategy, and roguelike design. You play as Simon P. Jones, tasked with uncovering the hidden 46th room inside the ever-shifting Mt. Holly Estate. Each day, the mansion reshuffles itself, forcing you to reopen doors, navigate new layouts, and piece together clues as you steadily rebuild your understanding of its labyrinthine structure.</p>



<p>What makes Blue Prince so captivating is how it turns that unpredictability into a deeply satisfying puzzle. Every run reveals new fragments of lore, fresh room combinations, and surprising twists that make the mansion feel alive. It’s inventive, atmospheric, and endlessly replayable, making it one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-clair-obscur-expedition-33">2. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Race against time. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Explaining why Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ranks among the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sets-record-as-2025s-best-third-party-xbox-game-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated games of the year</a> is almost impossible—not because the reasons are scarce, but because there are so many to choose from. The turn-based fantasy RPG blends a stunning Belle Époque–inspired aesthetic with a gripping, emotionally charged narrative, all while pushing the boundaries of what a modern turn-based RPG can be. Its combat system, worldbuilding, and striking visual identity come together in a way that feels both refreshingly new and instantly timeless.</p>



<p>It’s rare for a studio to deliver a debut title with this level of polish and ambition, yet that’s exactly what Sandfall Interactive has achieved. The French team has crafted something bold, beautiful, and unforgettable—an experience that resonates long after the credits roll. After all, there’s a reason it became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most nominated game ever at The Game Awards</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hades-2">1. Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hauntingly beautiful. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 95</strong></p>



<p>Hades 2 arriving in 2025 felt like the gaming world collectively holding its breath—and Supergiant Games delivered in a way only they could. After spending some time in early access, the sequel takes everything that made the original so beloved and expands it with confidence, introducing a new protagonist, a richer world, and even deeper layers of mythology to explore. The moment-to-moment gameplay is as sharp and addictive as ever, but there’s a newfound elegance in how combat, progression, and narrative flow together, making each run feel meaningful.</p>



<p>What elevates Hades 2 even further is how effortlessly it balances familiarity with innovation. Supergiant’s signature art style and storytelling return in full force, but the expanded cast, refined systems, and fresh environments give the sequel a flavour entirely its own. It’s bigger, bolder, and often more surprising than its predecessor—no small feat considering the heights the first game reached. In a year stacked with standout releases, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2 shines as the highest-rated game released in 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/">dealabs.com</a> has got the scoop on one of the games coming to PS Plus January 2026. According to their sources, the main title for January will be Need for Speed: Unbound on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Need for Speed Unbound - Speed Race Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBPZapIh4MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Criterion developed the game and it was published in 2022 by EA, and when it was released we gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/05/need-for-speed-unbound-review/">9/10 in our review</a>, calling it “the best arcade racer of 2022”. Since then it has had multiple updates but support for the game ended in in 2024 when Criterion moved on to help make Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 title is the PS5 version as Sony&nbsp; announced that January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>

<p><em>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</em></p>
<p><em>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</em></p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 games should be officially revealed later today on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/">PlayStation Blog.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h4>What are the PS Plus December 2025 Monthly Games?</h4>
<p>There’s a big bundle of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 2nd December until January 6th, 2026</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>The Outlast Trials</strong>&nbsp;| PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Synduality Echo of Ada</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>Neon White</strong>&nbsp;| PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s Fighting Game 2XKO Is Getting a Full Launch on PC & Consoles on January 20, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/</link>
            <guid>1394758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2025 early access debut on PC</a>, <strong>Riot</strong> is preparing to launch the fighting game <strong>2XKO</strong> as a full release on both PC and consoles. An announcement trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BVTEIoD_S0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was published a few hours ago on YouTube</a> by Riot but quickly went private, which means someone posted it beforehand. Still, even though it technically counts as a 'leak', it's the kind where the official source self-leaks the news in advance, and so can be considered accurate.</p>



<p>2XKO has been a long time coming. It all started after Radiant Entertainment, the studio that made <strong>Rising Thunder</strong> (as well as the city builder Stonehearth), was acquired by Riot in 2016. While that meant the cancellation of Rising Thunder, the founders, the <strong>Cannon brothers</strong>, quickly started working on a new fighting game under Riot.</p>



<p>That wasn't very surprising. Despite Stonehearth, the Cannon brothers were always more interested in fighting games than anything else; after all, they founded the <strong>Evolution Championship Series</strong> and also developed the <strong>GGPO</strong> middleware, which provided the <strong>rollback netcode technology</strong> now practically mandatory for any self-respecting fighting game with online functionality.</p>



<p>It took many years to get this new project running, though. The first confirmation that they were indeed working on a new fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-rising-thunder-devs-are-indeed-working-on-a-fighting-game-at-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in August 2019</a>, but it wasn't until August 2022 that fans got another major update, when the developers<a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-fighting-game-project-l-goes-free-to-play-new-fighter-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealed</a> that it would be a free-to-play title. The game's title, 2XKO, was only announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in February 2024</a>. That's also when we learned the first actual details on the game, which is a 2v2 tag-team fighting game where players select two characters from Riot's League of Legends setting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2XKO Official Cinematic: Ties That Bind ft. Courtney LaPlante of Spiritbox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyK3lFtz2H8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One champion starts as the "Point," while the other starts as the "Assist." Players can tag in and out to swap active fighters, creating a four-player arena. Active tagging lets you call in assists mid-combo to extend damage or set up mix-ups. Furthermore, tag-in timing is crucial to offensive flow.</p>



<p>In an attempt to improve accessibility to those who aren't well-versed in the genre, there are no traditional quarter-circle or dragon-punch motions in 2XKO; instead, champions use button combinations. Another key feature of the game is the Fuse system, a team-building customization mechanic (similar to League keystones) that grants abilities like back-to-back assist calling, increased damage at health advantage, or dual ultimates, allowing users to customize duo synergies and playstyles.</p>
