            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Teases Far Cry 60 FPS Update For THREE Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-teases-far-cry-60-fps-updates/</link>
            <guid>1409029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Far Cry team has posted an image on social media that clearly teases (and essentially confirms) the imminent arrival of 60 FPS updates for Far Cry 3, Far Cry: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry: Primal. While fans wait patiently for news about the next major Far Cry release, this is a welcome tidbit to surface, even if some of these updates are coming <strong>more than a decade </strong>after the games were released.</p>



<p>The newest game in the collection is Far Cry: Primal, a unique release that was released in February 2016. It puts players in control of a tribal warrior in a prehistoric era – ‘caveman times’.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-far-cry-updates-coming-soon">Major Far Cry Updates Coming Soon</h2>



<p>It’s not exactly hard to decode the image posted by the Far Cry social team recently. The strings of emojis aren’t enigmatic enough to require a code breaker. See for yourself:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you know Far Cry, it’s easy to decode the suggestions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Far Cry + Jungle + Six Tea + Frame Pair Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Blood Dragon + Six Tee + Film Pear Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Primate + Six Tea + Frame Purr Time = ?</li>
</ul>



<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘Far Cry 3 60 FPS update PLEASE,’ to which Ubisoft’s team simply responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I mean… it’s pretty clear what (it) is, no?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When one user decoded the messages, Ubisoft was pretty clear in their confirmation:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not clear if the updates will come with any other tweaks or optimizations, but who knows? Far Cry is in a bit of a slump right now, with the last game, Far Cry 6, having been the worst-received game in the series. This year will mark the game’s fifth anniversary, and fans are hungry for more.</p>



<p>Early in 2025, it was reported exclusively by Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">Ubisoft’s extraction-based multiplayer</a> title set in the Far Cry universe had been <strong>rebooted</strong> after failing to impress in internal reviews. It was going to be set in Alaska and would put players against the harsh environment, wildlife, and enemy players, but that was all pulled back for an assessment.</p>



<p>That’s in addition to Far Cry 7, known as Project Blackbird, which remains in development.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deadpool Pushed Marvel Rivals Player Count to Nine-Month High]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-player-count-soar/</link>
            <guid>1409026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no big secret that Deadpool is one of the most beloved Marvel characters of all time. The loud-mouthed mercenary is a fan-favorite through and through, which is why there was so much buzz around his arrival in Marvel Rivals, the sensational hero shooter with a star-studded line-up.</p>



<p>On Friday, January 16, Marvel Rivals’ sixth season of content went live, introducing Deadpool as a playable hero. The move caused players to <strong>flock back </strong>to the game, pushing the player count higher than it has been in <strong>nine months</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadpool-pulls-in-players-in-marvel-rivals">Deadpool Pulls in Players in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Yesterday, Marvel Rivals hit 200,027 players on Steam, the highest the count has risen since April 14, 2025, and the release of season two.  Every time a major update drops in Marvel Rivals, it’s accompanied by a small increase in player traffic, but nothing moved the ticker up quite like Deadpool has.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The sixth season of content in Marvel Rivals is more than just Deadpool, of course, including new controller settings, an improved photo mode, enhanced hero ‘Proficiency’, and a stack of new bundles in the store. With every new season also comes a fresh battle pass, so more reasons to dive back in and get to the Marvel Rivals grind.</p>



<p>This season brings a new limited-time event, some adjustments to existing modes, a fresh round of Twitch Drops for viewers watching their favorite streamers, and a whole host of fixes and optimizations.</p>



<p>The introduction to this season’s patch notes was ‘written by’ Deadpool himself:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deadpool here, hijacking the patch notes because, let’s face it, nobody reads these unless you need to know if your main got nerfed. Then you whine that there are no balance updates here, and some random internet person tells you what you really want is the Balance Post, not the Patch Notes. I see you, internet people! </strong></p>



<p><strong>Well, guess what? Season 6 is almost here! (They took this long to add me!? Who came before, oh Gambit &amp; Rogue… together? #$%&amp; that!) Anyways, I’m here, I’m playable, and I’m ready to make the Collector’s Museum wilder than a taco truck at a biker rally.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are still plenty of adored characters for NetEase to lean on for Marvel Rivals, so the train is far from running out of steam. Deadpool might be the hottest new character yet in Marvel Rivals, but he’s nowhere near the last.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Checking in on your gaming, we saw that <strong>Andrewww</strong> completed and snagged the platinum trophy for Alan Wake 2!

<p><em>That’s all for the round up this week. Enjoy the weekend and we’ll carry on carrying on on Monday.</em></p>

<p>This week has seen the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on Nintendo Switch 2, which the wonderfully handsome and beautiful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Alex had a look at</a>, the award-winning (and thoroughly excellent) <u><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a></u> finally dropped on Switch, and the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">The Legend of Heroes: Trials Beyond The Horizon</a> stuck the landing with epic RPG action on both Switch 1 and 2. Hooray!</p>
<p>In the news, it's been rather quiet overall, never a bad thing, but we <em>have</em> had some tasty nuggets in leaked looks at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zeldas-next-lego-set-might-have-been-leaked-heres-a-first-look">new Zelda lego set</a> (I'll take 10, thank you, and no I don't have any money), Sophia Turner <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/sophie-turner-looks-incredible-as-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-series">making an awesome-looking Lara Croft</a> (please put more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider</a> games on Switch 2, lads, come on now) and, of course, lest I forget - I could never - we've had the arrival of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/site-news-please-welcome-mai-the-newest-member-of-our-youtube-team">brand new member of the Nintendo Life YouTube team</a>. So if you haven't said hai to Mai yet, now's as good a chance as any.</p>
<p>Right. Enough messing. Let's take a look at what the team's game-playing plans are for this weekend!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I'll be doing a whole lot of racing around on Switch 2 for my next review, but I'll also definitely be making plenty of time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, which I'm finally serious about playing through, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, which is turning out to be a belter so far. It's no wonder we gave it a 9!</p>
<p>That's it for me, I think, all that gaming goodness and some sausages for tea. Have a relaxing one!</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm really hooked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> at the moment. Honestly, if I'd actually got my bum in gear and started playing this earlier, it might have wound up on my top five games of 2025. It's wonderful. The world just feels so alive, and I love sneaking around the different syndicate hideouts and stealing a bunch of goodies.</p>
<p>I'm eager to dive back into a <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda</a></strong> game at the moment, too, but which one is unclear at the moment. Maybe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> via NSO? Or perhaps I should give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> another shot. I'm sure I'll have an answer for you next week. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This week has been pretty spectacular for me, what with joining the Nintendo Life team and the Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 update releasing! Let’s just say I’ve spent every spare moment collecting over 1.5k of hotel tickets, tidying up my island and upgrading my house storage to accommodate my “collecting” habits.</p>
<p>Other than that, I’ve also been exploring some of the demos on the eShop, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. I have a soft spot for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares</a> games, so checking out the latest entry was pure adrenaline-pumping joy. I can’t wait to try it out when it finally releases. Is it weird to say that I can’t wait to get creeped out?</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is quite amazing I am this many years old and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_4">Halo 4</a>’s campaign remained an unspoiled experience. I am having quite a blast in the boots of Spartan 117 and should wrap up the game this weekend, which also wraps up all the single-player campaigns from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. I am now even more depressed with the cancellation of the TV show.</p>
<p>I'm having a hard time in virtual 16th-century Japan because I keep wandering into high-level zones and missions in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. I need to get more serious about this whole main plot revenge thing else I risk not having enough free storage space next week to trade Naoe and Yasuke’s adventures for Cloud and the Avalanche crew in Midgar.</p>
<p>On a more 'cosy game' affair, I have picked up the delisted 2014 remake of Cinemaware’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wings">Wings!</a>. Absolutely loved the original Amiga outing and was quite happy with both the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance versions, but had never played the <strong>Wings! Remastered Edition</strong> version, and I hope to shoot down von Richthofen before the sun rises on Monday.</p>
<p>Game of the week is the weekly Arcade Archive! Being quite the fan of the original back on both ZX Spectrum, NES, and Game Boy, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-bomb-jack-twin">Bomb Jack Twin</a> was the entry in the series that I would expect to show up on Super Nintendo or Mega Drive, but alas it was not meant to be, so this supercharged 16-bit sequel eluded us all.</p>
<p>Now, it shines forever on our modern console tablet thing.</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I've got some chums coming over this weekend, so I know what I'm going to be playing: <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>.</p>
<p>How does that sit with your preconceived notion of a weekend's entertainment, eh? Bet you couldn't imagine someone as hip and happening as me rolling dice and being nice to various peasants, could you? Well, it's happening, baby, and I'll probably bash out some Animal Crossing: New Horizons as well.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Animal Crossing has gotten its claws in me once more. Between stripping Kapp'n's tour islands of their natural resources and using said resources to craft crap to get access to more crap like a good little capitalist, I acquired a couple of genuine artworks from Redd by chance. Now I'm spying the only wing of my museum that isn't complete and wondering if this update is the excuse I need to 100% my collection.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I want to make time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a> now that it's out in Europe. Short and sweet, I've heard - looking forward to a kickaround. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend is Plane Time (again) and I'm about 1% through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, so getting through that is probably my job for the foreseeable future. And I don't mind at all! It's wonderful! Although the bit I'm at is a little hands-off. There was a lot more to do in the [REDACTED] but now it's a lot more visual novel-y. Maybe that'll change! Who knows! I have no idea where this game is going any more, and I love it.</p>
<p>Also, probably a fair bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Ball x Pit</a>, and another game I can't talk about because I'm playtesting it, shhhh.</p>

<p><em>That's our plans for the coming weekend. Now it's your turn to tell us yours, so make sure to get busy with our poll, and let yes know all about your weekend gaming plans in the comments!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are few moments in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> quite as harrowing as when Gollum leads Sam and Frodo into the lair of Shelob, the horrifying Spider-like creature and offspring of Ungoliant who snares and webs the poor Hobbits. Games Workshop has sent us an all-new feature box called <em>Path of Cirith Ungol: Shelob &amp; Gollum</em> to check out, along with the newest Swan Knights of Dol Amroth. We checked out the sprues, so follow along for this first sneak peek!</p><h2>Path of Cirith Ungol: Shelob &amp; Gollum</h2><p>First up is this wonderful new box set, <em>Path of Cirith Ungol: Shelob &amp; Gollum</em>, which features Shelob and Gollum both in brand-new poses. It <em>also</em>, importantly, features a very sad figure: Frodo unconscious and tied up in Shelob's webbing! There was a previous box set called <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/In-the-Clutches-of-Shelob?srsltid=AfmBOoozgrrsTynbK7AbMcfy7Y_WJAPrMEbmsRMxqsf1uTHGFOv3QJht" rel="nofollow"><em>In the Clutches of Shelob</em></a>, which included Shelob and Sam (with webbed up Frodo), but this new set swaps out Sam for Gollum.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>I love the new pose for Shelob included in this box set, which sees her crawling across a small crevasse of rocks, ready to strike. The previous model of Shelob had her rearing up on her hind legs, ready to strike. But this pose looks much more menacing, presenting her as the creeping terror she truly is.</p><p>Gollum also has another very gollum-y pose, perched on rocks and ready to strike (or scheme). This box set releases alongside a new book of scenarios all around Gollum, the Hobbits, and Shelob, entitled <em>The Treachery of Gollum</em>, which will present scenarios where players can reenact their favorite moments from the story.&nbsp;</p><p>From trying to steal the ring from a sleeping Frodo and Sam, to this pivotal confrontation with Shelob, there will be lots to explore.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-gollum-and-frodo.jpg?itok=QUNzb6W9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="644">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-gollum-and-frodo.jpg?itok=75ilp332 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="644">
                  

  </picture><p>I wasn't able to get my hands on an advanced copy of this new book, so I can't speak to updated rules for the figures or the scenarios, but needless to say I'm thrilled for its eventual release in a few weeks.</p><p>As for poor ol' master Frodo, he'll be stuck in place in his webbing, with this model to be used as an objective marker in the Bravery of Master Samwise scenario found in the new book. Now let's take a closer look at how the figures come on the sprue.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-path-of-cirith-ungol-shelob-and-gollum.jpeg?itok=SB6lG5Xk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1280" height="960">

  </picture><p>Looking over the assembly instructions, I appreciate the simplicity and straightforward nature of these sprues. The Shelob model, which could have been overly complicated, looks clean and streamlined, without the need to assemble five pieces per leg.</p><p>And Frodo simply couldn't look more pathetic on the sprue - don't you just want to swoop in and save the little guy?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-frodo-closeup.jpeg?itok=EL6kIf3- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1280" height="960">

  </picture><h2>Swan Knights of Dol Amroth</h2><p>I don't know why, but Prince Imrahil is one of my favorite characters from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, with very little time on the page (and no time in the films), he swoops in at the last minute with his Swan Knights to help save the day. Now, a new set of those very same Swan Knights are available from Games Workshop!</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-swan-knights-of-dol-amroth.jpg?itok=ZvcDMgpT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="1000">

  </picture><p>Cast in resin, these will be trickier to assemble than plastic miniatures. I, for one, have no patience, and use super-glue and a quick-dry solvent spray to put them together immediately. But more practiced and careful builders love the flexibility that gluing with super glue gives you, and more power to them!</p><p>Let's dive into the sprues on these models and see what we're working with here.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-knights-of-dol-amroth.jpeg?itok=B6Hau1PA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1280" height="960">

  </picture><p>The detailing on these knights is really quite incredible, I especially like their armor and plating, which sets them apart from other <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em> men-at-arms by having a more regal, well-equipped look to them.&nbsp;</p><p>These are fighting men with the training and coin to come to the battlefield ready to deliver a decisive blow (or at least <em>help</em> deliver that decisive blow).</p><picture>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-17-951/</link>
            <guid>1408972</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The weekend is here, which means it’s time to relax, get some tasks ticked off your to-do list that has inevitably built up over the week, and, most importantly, <strong>complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle</strong>. Fortunately, I can help you with that last point, as I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need, waiting for you below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-17">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 17)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #951:</p>



<ul>
<li>PLASTER</li>



<li>SLING</li>



<li>HIDE</li>



<li>BLANKET</li>



<li>PELT</li>



<li>SINK</li>



<li>RED</li>



<li>COAT</li>



<li>SKIN</li>



<li>COVER</li>



<li>CAST</li>



<li>INKS</li>



<li>SIMON</li>



<li>HURL</li>



<li>KINS</li>



<li>CAPTURE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Things you might lay on top.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Ways to really chuck something.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Same letters, different order</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>How classic playground games begin.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 17:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-17-951">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 17 (#951)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLANKET, COAT, COVER, PLASTER</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CAST, HURL, PELT, SLING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – INKS, KINS, SINK, SKIN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CAPTURE, HIDE, RED, SIMON</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tinder User Spots Nadeshot in Their Feed, But Something Isn’t Right]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tinder-user-nadeshot-feed-not-right/</link>
            <guid>1408966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a user uploaded an image to the Tinder subreddit of a recognizable face that popped up in their Tinder feed. They’d scrubbed out the profile name, but the image was clear as day: Matthew ‘Nadeshot’ Haag, former Call of Duty pro player, founder of 100 Thieves, and popular content creator.</p>



<p>The strange thing was, the profile <strong>absolutely wasn’t </strong>representative of the man himself. It was for a 28-year-old ‘night shift’ worker who is ‘overbearing and weird’.</p>







<h2 id="h-nadeshot-probably-doesn-t-use-tinder">Nadeshot Probably Doesn’t Use Tinder</h2>



<p>Being happily married and a father, the chances are that Nadeshot <strong>doesn’t </strong>use Tinder, but that doesn’t stop people from apparently impersonating him.</p>



<p>In a recent image shared on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/1qdyalf/umm_im_speechless/">the user ‘AlyFromCali’</a> revealed Nadeshot on the app in his ‘gun-to-the-head’ meme pose that <strong>many of us </strong>will already recognize.</p>



<p>The bio is cut off in the image, but we can see some of it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s be honest! Do people really read bios on tinder? Big on mutual obsession, I’m pretty overbearing and weird :3. So don’t say I didn’t warn…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a doozy of an intro.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The 28-year-old likely used the image of Nadeshot a) to grab attention, and b) because it sums up their vibe perfectly. The profile holder’s job title reads ‘night shift at labor thief’, so something is bubbling there to suggest not everything is hunky-dory in this person’s life.</p>



<p>Hence, the image of Nadeshot holding a gun to his head.</p>



<p>The user uploaded the image to Reddit because <strong>that </strong>was enough to creep them out – they didn’t even know it was Nadeshot. In the comments, they wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did notice he didn’t quite look the same in the rest of his pictures, but wtf.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s strange is that the image was the first one used on the profile, which means it’s the initial impression anyone gets of that person’s account. It also suggests that Tinder’s verification processes are potentially lax, as this could be seen as a catfishing attempt by some.</p>

            <guid>1408963</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a stellar extraction adventure title, but it’s not without some clear issues. Over the festive window, concerns started rising regarding cheaters, which went largely unaddressed until Embark Studios returned to the office as 2026 kicked off. Patches were pushed out, things improved, but certain problems remained.</p>



<p>One of the biggest problems is the ‘ceiling glitch’ mechanic that exists in the game, allowing users to manipulate their way above the map in certain areas and shoot down on unsuspecting players. In a recent clip online, it was shown how some users are fighting fire with fire.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-do-ceiling-glitches-in-arc-raiders">Don’t Do Ceiling Glitches in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded to social media by ‘aimkey’, we see a trio of players hightail it into the rafters of Stella Montis to exact revenge on… a trio of players in the rafters of Stella Montis.</p>



<p>It’s a weird game of cat and mouse that shows the ultimate punishment for those abusing an exploit that others are being banned for. Tired of people abusing the exploit, aimkey and his comrades glitch into the ceiling and chase down malicious players trying to use the glitch to <strong>take them out</strong>.</p>



<p>Is it right? Well, it’s two wrongs, and we know what the adage says about that.</p>



<p>It’s like the situation that surfaced a couple of years ago in Escape from Tarkov. One YouTuber purchased and used cheats in Escape from Tarkov, Battlestate Games’ popular extraction shooter, to determine <strong>who else was cheating</strong>. He stressed that he didn’t use the cheats to get an advantage over other users, but for research for his deep-dive video into the state of play.</p>



<p>It was a success, in some ways. He was able to semi-accurately see that cheaters were <strong>absolutely everywhere</strong>.</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders ceiling glitch situation isn’t as severe as <strong>that problem</strong>, but it is irritating, and as aimkey says, it’s ‘super easy to do.’</p>



<p>In the comments section under the clip, viewers were supportive of aimkey’s efforts:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘We got anti-exploiters before anti-cheat.’</li>



<li>‘Y’all just went up there and hunted them down? That’s great.’</li>



<li>‘We need more people to kill those guys who are spamming this glitch btw’</li>
</ul>



<p>Unfortunately, these kinds of issues have existed in multiplayer games since multiplayer games have existed. Back in the day, we’d use out-of-map exploits in games like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. There are some iconic spots, such as the hillside glitch on Overgrown, that are still memorable to this day.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Devs Didn’t Pay for The Game Awards Finale Spot]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/</link>
            <guid>1408960</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In December, The Game Awards ended the 2025 showcase with a reveal of Highguard, an all-new first-person shooter. It prompted a wave of disappointment from gamers eager to see which title would land the prestigious finale spot in one of the most-watched gaming events ever made.</p>



<p>Highguard emerged, with the developers at Wildlight uncovering a confusing, overdone first-person arena shooter, and viewers went nuts, wondering why they’d paid so much to secure the drastically expensive slot. It turns out that Wildlight didn’t pay for that spot in The Game Awards at all.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-a-million-dollars-saved">Half a Million Dollars Saved</h2>



<p>In recent years, the cost of acquiring space to run a trailer during The Game Awards has skyrocketed, with the longest slots now having around a half a million dollar price tag.</p>



<p>When Highguard, a brand-new game with no marketing beat before (or since) surfaced in the final spot, viewers were dismayed. There were expectations of something impressive appearing, but Highguard came on screen as a hard-to-pin shooter that looked like many other games we’d already seen emerge (and often fail) in recent years.</p>



<p>It was quickly judged as bizarre, because there was <strong>no way </strong>this all-new studio would stump up the half a million required to land that final spot, right?</p>



<p>In a new post <a href="https://xcancel.com/PaulTassi/status/2012258185495650308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a> by Forbes’ Paul Tassi, it was stated that the developers at Wildlight Entertainment <strong>did not pay </strong>for that spot:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Have learned that Highguard did not actually pay for that Game Awards finale spot. Was just the show putting it there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments, Tassi’s followers surmised that Geoff Keighley, the host of The Game Awards, was so enamoured by Highguard that he offered the team the final spot. That rings true, given Keighley’s hype for the game in the closing minutes of the show.</p>



<p>However, many were quick to point out that, if anything, the reveal did the game more harm than good. There’s now an emotional angle stifling the game’s anticipation, with folks everywhere wishing something else had popped up at the end of The Game Awards.</p>







<p>Do you think Highguard is going to exceed (low) expectations and surprise everyone when it launches in just nine days? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Ignited by a viral Metacritic campaign</p>

<figure data-uuid="c0e42cf26f5db"><a title="Cory in the House" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c0e42cf26f5db/cory-in-the-house.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Disney</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this week, the 2008 Nintendo DS title Disney title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/disneys_cory_in_the_house">Cory in the House</a> was reportedly on the cusp of dethroning the award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a> on Metacritic's user ranking list.</p>
<p>Although Clair Obscur <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/all-time/userscore/?releaseYearMin=1958&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=1">remains out in front at the time of writing</a> with a user score of 9.6, as a result of this viral campaign to get Cory's game into the top spot, it's now reportedly led to the title's price spiking in value on eBay. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awful-nintendo-ds-game-disney-cory-in-the-house-now-selling-for-hundreds-of-dollars-on-ebay-amid-viral-metacritic-campaign">highlighted by IGN</a>, the game is now being sold for "hundreds of dollars".</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fqnwkpr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>This includes sealed listings which have sold for up to $399 USD. It's quite a contrast to last year around November, when copies of the title were supposedly selling for under $10.</p>

<p>So, if you happen to have a copy of this DS shovelware on a shelf or packed away in a cupboard or box somewhere and it's in decent or pristine condition, now might be the time to offload it.</p>
<p>When this game was originally released, IGN (one of the few outlets to apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/25/cory-in-the-house-review">upload a professional review</a> when the title launched) said it was "awful" - awarding it a score of three out of ten, and noting how the short-lived experience had "some of the clunkiest controls", "insultingly stupid" presentation and minigames that were "hardly games at all".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The team behind Helldivers 2 planned to launch a new Warbond, Redacted Regiment, on January 20. However, Arrowhead Game Studios has indefinitely delayed the release after discovering an issue during final testing that failed to meet the studio’s quality standards.</p>



<p>The upcoming premium Warbond plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduce two new weapons</a> for players to use, as well as new Stratagems and cosmetics.</p>







<h2 id="h-arrowhead-game-studios-first-informed-the-helldivers-discord">Arrowhead Game Studios First Informed the Helldivers Discord</h2>



<p>While Arrowhead Game Studios did not specify exactly what went wrong during testing, they informed their Discord server that they would ensure the content was properly ready before releasing it to the public.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Greetings, Helldivers.</p>



<p>During final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn’t meet our standards for a release. We’re taking some extra time to get it fixed, so the Redacted Regiment Warbond is going to be delayed.</p>



<p>We’re sorry for the change in plans, but we want to make sure the update is actually ready for you before it goes live. Thanks for the patience.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Back in December, the studio confirmed that new Killzone-themed gear was headed to Helldivers 2 as a Premium Warbond. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-returns-as-a-legendary-warbond/">here</a>. In other news related to Helldivers, the team behind ARC Raiders revealed that they scrapped plans to make that game free to play because of Helldivers. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ditched-free-to-play-because-of-helldivers-2/">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The next Assassin’s Creed game has secured its Lead Scriptwriter, and it’s someone with a history of working on the franchise.</p>



<p>Christopher Grilli, someone with a history as the Scriptwriter for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and the lead writer for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, recently revealed on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophergrilli_im-thrilled-to-share-that-im-starting-a-activity-7417934734485413889-FrRL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> profile that he has signed on to be the Scriptwriter for the next game in the long-running franchise, code-named Hexe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m thrilled to share that I’m starting a new position at Ubisoft Montreal as a Lead Scriptwriter on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team and project,” he shared on January 16.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-everything-known-about-assassin-s-creed-hexe-so-far">Everything Known About Assassin’s Creed Hexe So Far</h2>



<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming reported</a> that the game was in a relatively early stage of development and was expected to be released this year. It’s also believed this will be a more linear experience than other games in the franchise, and that the series will feature a female protagonist named Elsa with supernatural abilities.</p>



<p>The game takes place in 16th-century Central Europe during the Holy Roman Empire, and reports indicate developers plan to implement a fear system inspired by the Jack the Ripper DLC from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>With the Lead Scriptwriter only now coming on board, it’s fair to suggest that the game is still a ways from release, but with someone with such experience on the team, it appears to be heading in the right direction.

                <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s Season 2 launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-update-delayed-to-help-refine-the-content-after-fan-feedback/1100-6537352/" data-ref-id="1100-6537352">was pushed back to February 17</a> to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined.</p><p>Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take "approximately 40% more hits" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update.</p><p>Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve "responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Happy Friday, <em>Game Informer </em>audience! You made it to the end of the week, and I hope some of the stories we published this week made doing so just a little bit easier. It was a slow week for reviews, previews, and the like – a very quiet January so far before the storm of releases that is February, which includes some big games – but a big one for news. We also completed a ton of magazine proofing and editing this week, and we're putting the final touches on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">the next issue</a>, featuring [REDACTED] on the cover, as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of, we'll be revealing said cover next week, so keep an eye out on <em>Game Informer's </em>social channels for exact details on when. You don't want to miss it!&nbsp;</p><p>I started <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/12/the-first-ever-pokemon-lego-sets-have-been-revealed-and-they-look-amazing">This Week On GI</a> as a formal article last week to detail weekly <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping updates AND to neatly and concisely organize all the content we published on the site that week. Below, you'll find the general <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping section followed by an article round-up underneath it:&nbsp;</p><h2>Game Informer Housekeeping</h2>

<p>Overall, it's a quieter week on the housekeeping front. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/wowmidnight">The latest magazine issue</a>, which features <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover/2025/12/16/cover-reveal-world-of-warcraft-midnight">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a> on the cover, continues to ship to mailboxes. We're aware that prior issues – mostly the The Outer Worlds 2 and, to a lesser extent, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined editions – had some shipping issues; it was the result of post service errors and shipping delays as a result of last year's government shutdown and while that was out of our hands, we take full responsibility and continue to try to make things right for those who are still waiting on magazines. That said, it seems like the majority of shipping problems are behind us, and the World of Warcraft: Midnight issue is reaching mailboxes in a timely and expected manner.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, thank you all for your patience as we work with our shipping partners to get everything back on track. We're looking forward to delivering some excellent physical magazine goodness to your mailboxes this year, and our next issue is a very exciting one, so get stoked!</p><p>If you aren't already a <em>Game Informer </em>subscriber, there's still time to become one and receive that issue – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">you can subscribe here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Story Round-Up</h2><p>Below, I've divided up the various sections of <em>Game Informer's </em>published stories, hopefully making it easy to check out the articles you might have missed.</p><h3>News</h3>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The video game industry’s awards season was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>dominated</span></a><span> this year by adulation for French turn-based roleplaying game</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span>. It’s easy to see why so many people loved it, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><span>AI usage</span></a><span> and</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>controversial status</span></a><span> as an “indie” game aside, but my personal game of the year was a much smaller project that garnered a lot less attention: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/baby-steps"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span>. Fortunately, at least one awards show is finally giving it the respect a bunch of us weirdos believe it deserves.</span></p> <p><span>The 2026 Independent Games Festival Awards released </span><a href="https://igf.com/article/baby-steps-strolls-to-lead-with-5-nominations-at-2026-igf-awards"><span>its list of nominees</span></a><span> on January 8, showcasing the incredible work of developers outside the AAA space. </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> managed to pick up nominations in five categories, including Excellence in Audio, Excellence in Design, Excellence in Narrative, the Nuovo Award (for “experiences that make the awards jurors think differently about games as a medium”), and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/baby-steps-qwop-indie-devolver-pc-ps5-new-trailer-1850521583"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span> tells the story of Nate, a man transported from living in squalor in his parents’ basement to a magical world inhabited by long-dicked donkey men and Australians. Navigating this strange setting, at least on PlayStation 5, revolves around using the controller’s triggers to independently control Nate’s feet by lifting them off the ground, and the control stick to have Nate lean in whatever direction you intend on traveling. Even simple walking requires maintaining a rhythm, and things get even more difficult as you climb slippery slopes and awkward rockfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’m so happy to see </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> get this kind of recognition. Not only does it advance the nascent genre of physics-based “rage games” practically invented by co-developer Bennett Foddy (who previously made&nbsp;<em>QWOP </em>and <em>Getting Over It</em>),&nbsp;but it also manages to interrogate the very concept of challenging video game mechanics through both gameplay and narrative. Please play this game, and remember, </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> doesn’t want you to rage, it wants you to love yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>Offbeat local TV broadcast simulator</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/blippo-plus"> <i><span>Blippo+</span></i></a><span>, surreal strategy game</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/titanium-court"> <i><span>Titanium Court</span></i></a><span>, and the bafflingly controversial</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><i><span>Horses</span></i></a><span> also received multiple nominations. After seeing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>the Game Awards</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115137649/en/Finalists-Announced-for-the-26th-Annual-Game-Developers-Choice-Awards-Led-by-Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-With-Eight-Total-Nominations"><span>the Game Developers Choice Awards</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/29th_dice_awards_finalists_93k3p1.asp"><span>the DICE Awards</span></a><span> focus almost exclusively on </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> and other mainstream, AAA fare, it’s refreshing to know there are still shows dedicated to plumbing the depths of the medium rather than remaining at surface level.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Furthermore, this year’s show features a new category honoring games made by women and other gender-marginalized developers in collaboration with investment fund</span> <a href="https://www.wingsfund.me/"><span>Wings Interactive</span></a><span>.

      <p>What are the best mothers and ships in video games? Thank goodness there’s a website for that now.</p><p><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/board-the-mothership/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mothership</u></a>, a new publication at the intersection of gender and games from ex-Polygon staffers Maddy Myers and Zoë Hannah, is the one bright spot in <a href="https://aftermath.site/layoff-verge-inverse-gaming/"><u>an already terrible year</u></a> for games media. Also, it’s about way more than mothers and ships. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>, Maddy and Zoë tell us about their plans for the site and what it means to launch a publication like this in an era when feminist media has been gutted, and even venerable institutions like Teen Vogue – a primary inspiration for Mothership – <a href="https://www.cjr.org/feature/the-tragic-loss-of-teen-vogue.php?ref=aftermath.site"><u>have fallen</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about <a href="https://defector.com/how-much-is-eight-dollars?ref=aftermath.site"><u>how much money $8 is</u></a> (actually $10, but also possibly $5). We also imagine what might happen if Asmongold, fresh off <a href="https://x.com/Disinfo_Tracker/status/2011808087431397672?ref=aftermath.site"><u>being retweeted by JD Vance</u></a>, travels to The White House and gives Donald Trump some kind of plague. Nothing too terrible, of course!</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> From one of our readers: Who/what is the best mother in games? Use whatever meaning of the term “mother” you want. And what’s your favorite ship? Use whatever meaning of “ship” you want.</p><p><strong>Maddy: </strong>Oh my god. Best mother in games is legit hard because there’s almost no moms in games.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Best as in “best portrayal of what motherhood often ends up being like” is the lady from <em>Portal</em>.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Chell?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Not Chell, the robot.</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> GLaDOS and Chell’s mommy-daughter relationship is terrifying.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That is a mother-daughter relationship, and that is a pretty accurate representation of how a lot of adult women feel about their mothers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> Yeah, I would say [it’s the] best in terms of a story potential and also an iteration on, I would say, the classic Mother Brain-Samus relationship, which is of course an iteration on the original <em>Alien </em>movie – the mother AI in that movie. All of these things are permutations of permutations of permutations, and GLaDOS is one of the greatest ones. The idea of a super computer AI being a female voice and also therefore being your mom and evil – just kind of knowing that lineage is so key there. It’s part of what makes GLaDOS so fascinating and still relevant today to some of the conversations we have about AI and what it’s for and what it does.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Do you have any other ideas of who the best mom is?</p><p><strong>Maddy: </strong>I mean, I don’t know. There’s a lot of bad moms in games. I did like <em>Returnal</em>, where you get to play as a woman who’s kind of wrestling with the idea of that. I might go with that. But I think GLaDOS is also a really great answer as a multifaceted mother figure character.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Your mom doesn’t want you to disobey her, and if you do, she’ll kill you.</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> Maybe it says something that it’s so easy to think of bad moms in games. I think that may be something to interrogate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Along the same lines as, at a certain point in time, all video games became about being a father.</p><p><strong>Maddy: </strong>Yeah, but we still haven’t had the time where all video games are about being a mother. They’re instead about the game developer’s relationship with their mother – which says something about who’s making games still and how many of them are mothers. Maybe not that many.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Do you have a favorite ship?</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> I was asked on the Minn/Max show earlier this week about what I picture as being the Mothership, and I talked about the Protoss mothership in <em>StarCraft II</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Who’s ready to stream the <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816">new<em> Zelda</em> movie</a> on Netflix at their in-laws’ in 2027? Why did Sony delete over 1,000 shovelware games from PSN? And just how bad are graphics card prices about to get? Welcome to a special afternoon edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Look, I was really busy today.</p> <p>Here’s your moment of zen for the weekend: local news broadcasters <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@quietcharacterofficial/video/7595295106295532818">trying to say the names of famous Pokémon</a>.</p>   <h2>Sony and Netflix lock in a new mega deal after the success of <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em></h2> <p>“Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) today announced a landmark global Pay-1 licensing deal. In the exclusive multi-year agreement, SPE’s feature films will stream on Netflix worldwide — an industry-first for Pay-1 — following their full theatrical and home entertainment windows,” the companies revealed this week. Netflix cited Nintendo’s upcoming live-action <em>Zelda</em> adaptation as a specific example toward the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal">bottom of its announcement</a>. It hits theaters on March 26, 2027.</p>

 <p><span>“Some of the first SPE feature film titles that will stream on Netflix as part of the new deal include </span><em><span>The Nightingale</span></em><span>, the highly anticipated adaptation of Kristin Hannah’s global sensation starring Dakota and Elle Fanning together for the first time; Sony Pictures Animation’s </span><em><span>Buds</span></em><span>; Nintendo’s live-action </span><em><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></em><span>; </span><em><span>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</span></em><span>, the conclusion to the groundbreaking<em> Spider-Verse</em> trilogy; and Academy Award-winner Sam Mendes’ audacious quartet of Beatles films,” it read.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>If a graphics card is still being stocked but no one can get it, does it still matter?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE"><em>Hardware Unboxed</em> reported</a> earlier this week that the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti had effectively reached “end-of-life” status and would no longer be supplied by manufacturers. That was sourced in part to comments from Asus, which quickly turned around and said no, no, no, you’ve got it all wrong.</p>

 <p>“Current fluctuations in supply for both products are primarily due to memory supply constraints, which have temporarily affected production output and restocking cycles,” it said <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/statements/asus-rtx-5070ti-5060ti-statement/">in a statement</a>. “As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement.”</p>

 <p>That means you can still get one, right? Right?? A quick search online shows they’re out of stock at Best Buy, Microcenter, and other retailers, with even cards marked up 50 percent over the $750 MSRP being on back order.</p> <h2><em>Toy Story Mania</em> and 13 other Disney games just disappeared from Steam</h2> <p>The delistings were spotted by <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted">Steamgifts forum member HappyCatEW</a>. Other games removed from Valve’s storefront include <em>Finding Nemo</em>, <em>Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell’s Adventure</em>, and <em>Chicken Little: Ace in Action</em>. It’s unclear if this is part of a larger move on Disney’s part or just someone looking at a particular segment of the gaming division and wondering why it’s still maintaining listings for games that people aren’t really playing. Still, <em>Disney’s Hercules</em> has seven people in-game right now according to SteamDB. Game preservation suffers another blow.</p>

 <h2><em>The Grudge 2</em>‘s Teresa Palmer is the<em> God of War</em> TV show’s latest casting addition</h2> <p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-cast-teresa-palmer-1236633293/">She’ll play Sif</a>, Thor’s wife, alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584">Ryan Hurst</a>, who played Thor in&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarök </em>but is playing leading man Kratos here. Getting confused yet? Notably, Sif doesn’t appear in <em>God of War</em> 2018, suggesting the first season of the Amazon adaptation will be blending characters and events from across the whole Norse saga.</p>

 <h2>Sony nukes a bunch of PlayStation shovelware</h2> <p>Over 1,000 games, in fact. The mass deletions were spotted <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">by </a><span><a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">RobThanatos</a> and took aim at ThiGames_DE, which supposedly was ranked 4th for total number of listings across all of PSN. The game titles were things like <em>The Jumping Taco</em>, <em>The Jumping Hot Dog</em>, <em>The Jumping Soda</em>, and<em> The Jumping Taco TURBO</em>. Quick and cheap Platinum trophies, in other words. RIP to some real ones.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435">Backlog week has begun, but what even is a backlog in 2026?</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">There’s a very convincing theory about why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ framerates are so bad on PC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><em>The Fallout 3</em> and<em> New Vegas</em> remaster rumors have gotten out of control</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

			<p>Following our previous reports on John Gibson's stance regarding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-gibson-ex-tripwire-ceo-underrepresented-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"underrepresented majority" in gaming</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-tripwire-ceo-remote-work-game-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the efficiency pitfalls of remote work</a>, we are now presenting the <strong>full transcript</strong> of our lengthy conversation with the executive, which lasted more than 60 minutes and has been slightly edited and condensed for brevity.</p>



<p>John Gibson isn't just a veteran with 25 years in the trenches of the industry; he is a co-founder of Tripwire Interactive (<a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he stepped down in September 2021</a>) with a track record of several consecutive profitable titles. Now at the helm of <strong>Templar Media</strong>, Gibson has made no qualms of critiquing what he calls a "monolithic political block" in modern game development, advocating for a return to the <strong>"Entertainment First</strong>" philosophy of the 80s and 90s.</p>



<p>In the following transcript, Gibson pulls no punches on the <strong>"video game apocalypse"</strong> of layoffs and delays, the current development progress and challenges of making the Bible-based adventure game <strong><em>Gate Zero</em></strong> (Templar Media <a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased developer <strong>Bible X</strong></a> last month), and his pragmatic approach to utilizing <strong>AI in development</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="pivot-entertainment-first"><a href="#pivot-entertainment-first">The Pivot to Templar Media: From Tripwire to "Entertainment First"</a></h2>



<p><strong>John, for those who haven't followed your recent transition, could you tell us about your journey from leading Tripwire Interactive to founding your new venture, Templar Media?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Sure thing. I was formerly the co-founder, co-owner, and CEO of Tripwire Interactive. Now, I am leading Templar Media. I founded Templar Media earlier this year. After selling Tripwire, I took a break, but I realized I wanted to get back into games. I noticed that in a lot of media, the focus had shifted away from pleasing the player or the viewer. Instead, it was often about whatever commentary or message a developer or entertainer wanted to convey. This is where our slogan, <strong>"Entertainment First,"</strong> originated. I wanted to establish a company focused on creating great content that people truly enjoy. While everyone aims to make something great, players can tell if your primary focus is not on building an entertaining and fun game. Our goal is to make great, entertaining content.</p>



<p>We are catering to an underserved mainstream market. In America and somewhat in Europe, the people creating entertainment often represent a monolithic political block. However, consumers are not a monolithic block and do not necessarily share the same views as those making the entertainment. There is an underrepresented majority that wants entertainment without a specific agenda. When I was growing up, movies like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> or games like <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Metroid</em> were about entertaining you, not an agenda. This has been lost in much of modern entertainment. For example, in the new <em>Dragon Age</em> game, there is a cutscene where the player is lectured about pronouns. We experience entertainment to forget about day-to-day politics and just have fun. Entertainment needs to go back to focusing on entertaining people. While our first game is faith-based, we are not afraid to tell those stories to an underserved market and to anyone who simply wants great content without modern agendas. As a company owner and designer, you must focus on what the customer will enjoy, not just your own preferences.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GateZero_GC_Screenshot-19-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="underserved-faith-based-market"><a href="#underserved-faith-based-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gate Zero: Tapping into the Massive Underserved Faith-Based Market</a></h2>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> The first game we are developing tells biblical stories, allowing players to experience the Bible firsthand. This is not the only type of content we will produce, but we are not ignoring it either. In the television and movie industries, faith-based content is currently massive. It has gained mainstream success with projects like <em>The Chosen</em>, <em>Jesus Revolution</em>, and <em>House of David</em>. This mirrors the 1950s in America, when movies like <em>The Ten Commandments</em> were mainstream box office hits. <strong>Regardless of a person's faith, these are foundational stories of Western society and are simply great, entertaining narratives</strong>. We will not shy away from such content, but our primary goal remains to entertain people. </p>



<p><strong>How did your relationship with the Norwegian studio Bible X begin? Were you always a believer in the project from day one, or did it take some convincing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> I initially reached out to the Bible X team a couple of years ago after seeing videos for <em>Gate Zero</em> in my social media feed. To be candid, I had low expectations for faith-based entertainment, assuming it would not be very good. However, the project kept appearing in my feed, and I eventually decided to reach out. Although I was retired and did not need to work anymore, this project seemed interesting. I quickly got to know the team, and they asked me to serve as their executive game consultant to help make the game better.</p>



<p>When I played what they were working on, I saw a team that was excellent at storytelling and art with a great vision, but they needed help making the game truly fun. BCC Media, the parent organization of Bible X, has long-standing experience in media, including satellite television, film, and animated features. They already used Unreal Engine technology for their animated features. They had the technical and storytelling background, and I brought 25 years of video game design and execution experience to the table. I worked with them for a while to improve the game.</p>



<p>When I started Templar Media, I looked for titles to publish. Aside from the quality of the game, I looked for leading indicators of success. It is challenging to determine what will be successful years in advance. One indicator I look at is social media response. At my previous company, after 17 years, we had about 40,000 social media followers across all platforms. In a short amount of time, <em>Gate Zero</em> and Bible X had 500,000 grassroots followers. My previous company had games with 35 million players that sold millions of copies, yet we only had 40,000 followers. This indicated a very high level of interest in <em>Gate Zero</em>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GateZero_GC_Screenshot-18-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="kickstarter-proved-gate-zero-hype"><a href="#kickstarter-proved-gate-zero-hype">Why Kickstarter Success Proved the Gate Zero Hype</a></h2>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Another business indicator I examined was Kickstarter. While Kickstarters usually do not fund an entire project, they help gauge public interest. Most video game Kickstarters fail, raising an average of about $2,800 to $3,000. When Bible X prepared their Kickstarter, a consultancy firm suggested setting the goal at approximately €30,000. The team decided that was not enough to prove potential success and set the goal at €200,000. They hit €200,000 in less than three days and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gatezero/gate-zero-a-bible-exploration-video-game?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Gate%20Zero&amp;total_hits=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>reached €300,000 by the end of the 30-day campaign</strong></a>. This was a smash hit that proved an audience wants this kind of entertainment.</p>



<p>These indicators led me to sign the game as a publisher. As development has progressed, I have looked for further signs of success. In 2008, when I looked at <em>Killing Floor</em> for my previous company, we saw massive potential and decided to buy the IP. That first game eventually sold 6 million copies. <strong>I am seeing even higher indicators for <em>Gate Zero</em>, and as I play what we are creating, I see that something special is being made</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Game-Delays-Remote-Work-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="remote-work-and-inflated-salaries-fueling-game-delays-and-layoffs"><a href="#remote-work-inflated-salaries-delays-layoffs">The "Video Game Apocalypse": Remote Work and Inflated Salaries Fueling Game Delays and Layoffs</a></h2>



<p><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry? There's a lot of discussion on the layoffs that have hit big and small companies alike in the past few years, shortly after the COVID-induced boom ended.</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> The industry faced a "video game apocalypse" in 2023 and 2024 as things collapsed following the pandemic boom. Games were not always of high quality or were taking much longer to develop. For instance, the sequel to <em>Killing Floor 2</em> took five years to make. <strong>I believe part of the reason for these delays is distributed work</strong>. While working from home feels great, people are often less efficient and less creative. Some of the greatest ideas in the games I have worked on came from random encounters in the hallway. Two people might have different parts of a great idea, chat in the hallway, and create a whole concept for the game. As part of this acquisition, the core team on <em>Gate Zero</em> is relocating to our offices in Georgia. Having everyone in the office will allow us to iterate quickly to finish the game. This business decision will result in a more entertaining and fun game for the player.</p>



<p><strong>Another challenge was overinflated salaries during the pandemic</strong>. Companies with high COVID-era profits were overpaying for talent. For instance, an engineer might be offered a million dollars for their first year. This was unsustainable, and many of those companies eventually conducted massive layoffs. There is now a reset occurring where people must readjust their salary expectations to fair, sustainable levels.</p>



<p>We are also focused on right-sizing budgets. My lead producer once asked how we could make a game for $100 million, and my response was, "How do you spend $100 million making this game?". <strong>Companies sometimes go bankrupt because they spend too much and lose focus. You have to be pragmatic and scale up with the market</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Fortnite</em> is a major factor in the industry, "sucking a lot of the air out of the room". To exist alongside it, you must offer a unique experience. It is not necessarily about direct competition. When I made <em>Killing Floor</em>, <em>Left 4 Dead</em> had just come out, and people questioned if the market could support another zombie game. We sold six million copies because the games were different enough.</p>



<p>But the market has grown significantly. When I signed the first Steam agreement in 2005, Steam had perhaps 3 to 5 million users. Now it has about 180 million, and <em>Fortnite</em> has 150 million. In the past, a million units was a massive success; now, successful games can sell 30 to 50 million units. There is room for games that sell 1 to 5 million copies. A rising tide lifts all ships, and a generation raised on games wants diverse experiences. A single-player experience like <em>Gate Zero</em> can find its place in the market. I am also not opposed to making live service games, as we were successful with titles like <em>Chivalry 2</em> alongside <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>



<p><strong>How many developers are currently working on the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Between developers and contractors, <strong>there are 25 people on the team, plus about 10 from Templar, totaling 30 to 35 people</strong>. While we do not have a <em>GTA</em> budget, this is not a small indie game. It will compete with AAA titles and <strong>has a budget greater than $10 million</strong>. This is the studio's first game, so we are careful with spending, intending to increase resources for subsequent versions if the first is successful. I think of it like <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> was a high-quality movie, but once it was a hit, they could put significantly more resources into the second and third films. <em>Gate Zero</em> will be a quality game built on a healthy, reasonable budget.</p>



<p>When I first met the Bible X team, I noted that during my time as CEO and co-owner of my previous company, I was involved in 15 games, every one of which made a profit. Part of that success involves right-sizing the budget and picking a great title. I told the team we should make something undeniably great, and I informed them that it would require doubling their original budget. </p>



<p><strong>Can you share any details about Gate Zero's pricing and launch window estimates yet?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Regarding pricing, it is too early to share a specific price, but it will be more budget-friendly than other big AAA games. It will not cost as much as an $80 game or a new Switch game, but it will not be a $19 game either. <strong>We are over halfway through development; it is not coming out next week, but it will not take two years either</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="mixing-assassins-creed-narrative-agency-gameplay-and-influences-mixing-assassin-s-creed-with-narrative-agency"><a href="#mixing-assassins-creed-narrative-agency">Gameplay and Influences: Mixing Assassin's Creed with Narrative Agency</a></h2>



<p><strong>Gate Zero has drawn some comparisons to Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed. How do you define the gameplay style, and what other major titles influenced the game's design?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> While there are some of those elements, <strong>I describe it as a mix of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, the newer <em>Zelda</em> games, and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em></strong>. The comparisons to <em>Assassin's Creed</em> are natural because we have a time machine and are going back to ancient history. Furthermore, we have several former <em>Assassin's Creed</em> developers on the team, including an art director who worked on several entries in that series. We also have the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> contract art team and developers from other major games. I worked on <em>Killing Floor</em>, <em>Maneater</em>, and <em>Chivalry 2</em>. We have people from Rockstar who worked on <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>GTA</em>, as well as a developer from the original <em>Thief</em> game. The game includes stealth, action, exploration, and puzzles. It will be a unique combination of genres with a deep narrative and narrative trees.</p>



<p>I love narrative and stories, and I am a fan of games like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, where choices matter. In <em>Gate Zero</em>, <strong>the character Max is a 15-year-old who is not a person of faith. He uses a time machine to end up in 30 AD during significant events. He grows through moral decisions that are not always cut and dry. These decisions impact the story, dialogue choices, and who aligns with him. We want the player to have agency in their story</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Given the target audience of faith-based entertainment, I have to ask how much action (and potentially blood) there will be in your game.</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> We are holding off on discussing the action in detail until early next year because we believe we have something compelling that people have not seen before. <strong>There is compelling action in the game; it is not a "walking simulator" or strictly a puzzle game</strong>.</p>



<p>By the way, we also have specific rules for time travel to avoid messing up the timeline. Max looks like he could be of Italian or Roman heritage. If he goes around killing Roman guards, he might inadvertently kill an ancestor and cease to exist. Designing around these constraints forces us to be creative. It is similar to the challenges we faced making the shark gameplay in <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/maneater-rough-waters-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maneater</a></em> fun. Because the game is set in 30 AD rather than a time of open war like the eras of Samson or David, putting action into it is an interesting design problem.</p>

<p><strong>I've read that the game will feature a co-play element that works with smartphones. What can you share about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Often, when someone plays a single-player game, their friends get bored and look at their phones. The co-play feature engages everyone in a party atmosphere. Friends can play mini-games on their phones that help the player on the screen. This scales to larger groups of up to 10 people. I have never seen this done well before, as mobile apps for games often just feel like an extension of the HUD. <strong>Because of the faith-based elements, youth groups could play the game together, which is a unique group element for the target audience</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, let's discuss the proverbial elephant in the room: the usage of AI in the games industry. Some developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently came under fire from fans after disclosing their usage of AI</a>. Where do you stand on this topic?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> When used properly, <strong>AI is a tool that speeds up human creativity rather than replacing it</strong>. For <em>Gate Zero</em>, our concept artists might hand-draw a concept and then use AI to generate 10 other versions to accelerate development. It helps augment the increasing costs of development. We are still very far from a "Star Trek holodeck" that can generate entire games on command.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, teams had to create their own game engines. Later, the licensing of engines enabled smaller teams to make better games that could compete with big developers. Similarly, AI can give smaller teams an edge. More broadly, AI presents challenges that governments may not be ready to tackle. If AI and robotics converge alongside quantum computing, economies and the world will change significantly. It might not be <em>The Terminator</em>, but it could be <em>I, Robot</em>.</p>



<p><strong>In Templar Media, my policy is that AI answers cannot be considered truth</strong>. Employees can use tools like ChatGPT to find a direction, but they must always find and share the primary source for any fact. ChatGPT often gets things wrong. For example, I once searched for the production numbers of a rare 1983 Pontiac Trans Am I own. The AI stated that about 600 were made, which was correct, but its primary source turned out to be my own Instagram post. AI is a tool, but do not assume it knows everything or is always correct.</p>



<p><strong>Definitely. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
