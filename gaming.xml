		<p>If you had to pin down Japanese games from the late 80s with two key characteristics, it would have to be genre-defining new ideas and baffling naming conventions, especially when bringing those games to the West. Final Fantasy’s number confusion is well known, but Dragon Quest has its own convoluted naming history so that, chronologically speaking, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is retelling the first game in the series – a series originally called Dragon Warrior in the US. Square Enix are sticking with it, though, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-is-coming-out-in-november-dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remakes-in-2025/">an HD-2D trilogy going in canonical order</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake – Release Date trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJoq6FWY-00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Square Enix has often tapped into the rich vein of their 80s and 90s Dragon Quest back catalogue, whether it’s with modern mash-ups like Dragon Quest Heroes and Dragon Quest Builders, or the various enhanced remakes and ports that go all the way back to early smartphones, Game Boy Color and even Super Famicom. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is re-retreading ground in those respects, but given how good the results are, I doubt anyone will complain.</p>


<p>Playing on Nintendo Switch (and with the game also coming to PlayStation, Xbox and PC), this HD-2D remake looks simply sublime. I’m at the point where I think Square Enix should put their entire library through the HD-2D conversion process. Sure, there’s the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series which is a great way of preserving the original art style and adventures for new systems, but HD-2D provides a far more luxurious and appealing feel to the games.</p>


<p>You still have the same form and structure to the world of Dragon Quest III, with an overworld to wander across getting into randomised battles, and then towns and dungeons to venture into. There’s a lot of lovely touches and tweaks across all of this, though. The landscape of the overworld has a subtle topography to it, for example, which you’ll also notice in a town like Reeve, and the buildings that you step into in Aliahan feel larger and packed with more visual detail. All buildings have separate interiors now, instead of being exposed while wandering the town. Then there’s just the lighting, which adds a delightful dusky glow as nighttime descends and has shafts of sunlight streaming through windows.</p>
<p>Really the only downside I can think of is that these conversions will take longer to produce, as they’re rebuilding games in Unreal Engine. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D was announced way back in 2021 and it’s more than three years later that it’s coming out. Even so, I know there’s people who’ve been banging on tables for a Chrono Trigger HD-2D remake for years now.</p>

<p>As well as the graphical overhaul, there’s some quality of life improvements that have been fed into Dragon Quest III. Most noticeably there’s now a mini-map in the top right corner, so you can better see where you’re heading – though pulling up the full map will still needed at times to avoid getting too lost in dungeons – there’s better equipment icons for managing your party’s gear, and you can save at churches and certain other figures, not just when chatting to Kings. There’s also auto-saves as a further fallback.</p>
<p>The early part of the game has been improved with more tutorials, both with hints and tips being dished out by people you chat to in towns, and with full pop-ups at key points to explain other key ideas.</p>
<p>A common nicety of a modern remake is a sped up combat system, and that’s very true in this HD-2D remake. By default you simply control the Hero while the rest of your four-person party will automatically fire off attack and abilities in accordance with predefined tactics settings. You can adjust these on the fly to emphasise support or all-out attack, set the whole party to automate, or just take individual control for key moments, and on the whole it’s a great way to get through any level grinding. You’ve also got three speed settings for combat, with the middle ‘Fast’ setting being what felt most comfortable for me. There’s also three difficulty settings – the witty ‘Draky’, ‘Dragon’ and ‘Draconian’.</p>

<p>There are still some historical oddities, though. The main combat screen initially shows your characters arrayed against the enemies, but as attacks are dished out it switches to the old view of just enemies. Additionally, you can only target enemy types, as opposed to specific enemies, and that does limit your ability to gang up on particular enemies. It could have gone a touch further in the revamp here, but chose instead to preserve the original style.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is shaping up to be a truly sublime way to revisit this classic RPG, staying true to the original, but giving us those sumptuous HD-2D stylings alongside plenty of modern quality-of-life tweaks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/new-playstation-portal-update-will-make-it-very-slightly-better/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has released a new system software update for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a> – the Remote Play specific companion device for PlayStation 5 – adding a handful of relatively small features.</p>
<p>The headline new feature is the ability to connect to your home console from external, public networks – networks in hotels, cafes, train stations and airports that often require you to pass through a sign-in screen, as opposed to a network password. Presumably wary of exposing a web browser to users on device, as these are often avenues used for jailbreaking a device, you’ll have to scan a QR code and then use your phone’s web browser to complete the log-in steps.</p>


<p>You will still need to find a Wi-Fi network with a decent connection. At minimum you need to have 5Mbps down, but 15Mbps is recommended.</p>
<p>Honestly, given that I saw connection stability issues while on my home network, and with the device featuring just a 1×1 antenna arrangement, when 2×2 would provide greater speed and stability, I would go into this use case with low expectations and hope to be surprised.</p>
<p>Next up is a tweak to the on-screen touchpad regions, giving visual feedback with a highlight pulse and leaving a trail if you drag your thumb around. It’s a positive step to make this feel more intuitive to use, though could still be further enhanced with a haptic tap, perhaps.</p>

<p>And lastly, you can display the battery percentage by navigating to&nbsp;[Settings] &gt; [System] &gt; [Battery], and then turn on [Show Battery Percentage].</p>
<p>The PlayStation Portal has been a rather popular device, it seems, and has often been out of stock as Sony fail to meet demand. Over 60% of PS Portal buyers use the feature for the first time, with the average PS Portal gamer playing more PS5 games in the first two months of owning one… then again, this window does line up quite nicely with the heights of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> boom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this update doesn’t answer some of the key weaknesses or realise the full potential of the PS Portal. There’s no latency reducing direct connection mode to cut out your home network and shave off another few milliseconds of responsiveness, there’s no support for generic Bluetooth headphones – not even Sony’s own non-gaming bluetooth headphones – and the PS Portal also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/23/playstation-portal-remote-play-controller-will-cost-200-wont-stream-from-playstation-cloud/">doesn’t have support for Sony’s PlayStation Plus cloud gaming</a> platform. It remains absolutely baffling.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More than 10 years later, Nintendo is righting its Zelda and Peach crimes]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-than-10-years-later-nintendo-is-righting-its-zelda-and-peach-crimes.905037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="tLoIRu">Princess Zelda will be a playable protagonist in a mainline Legend of Zelda game in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>. Both as far as game design philosophy goes — Zelda doesn’t wield a sword but a wand that can replicate objects — and the choice to make the princess the main character, the game is looking like it represents a daring next step for the Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole. Between that and the release of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>last year, it’s a thrilling time to be a Zelda fan. </p>
<p id="ybNZq0">However, Nintendo wasn’t always so bold with its decision to include women in games nor tactful in the way that it portrayed those women when they got their big chance in the spotlight. Just look to Nintendo’s other leading lady, Princess Peach. Her first big foray as protagonist in a Mario game came with the 2005 Nintendo DS game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/24102309/super-princess-peach-showtime-nintendo-lookback"><em>Super Princess Peach</em></a>. The game featured a “vibe” system whereby Peach could unleash her overwhelming emotions to perform special attacks. It stood out at the time for the way it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjImnqH_KwM">reinforced stereotypes that women are overly emotional</a>, despite featuring her as the protagonist.</p>
<p id="5DENp7">However, 2024 has clearly brought on somewhat of a shift in the way Nintendo sees its princesses. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24099786/princess-peach-showtime-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a> was undoubtedly a step forward for Peach and the way games treat her. Instead of her power being fueled by her uncontrollable emotions, Princess Peach can take on countless forms using theatre props and costumes; she can be as strong as a sword-fighter or as graceful as a figure skater, and once again, she’s the star in a game of her own. And despite not being playable, Princess Zelda took on a very active role in the story of<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a><em> </em>by working to set Link up for victory (although <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23802993/loz-totk-ending-zelda-dragon-master-sword-ganondorf">this interpretation is complicated</a>). Those games are now coupled with the fact that we’ve gotten one of the most important steps of all: playable Zelda. </p>
<p id="geOijs">This is not the first time Princess Zelda has been playable. Players can choose to fight as her in spin-off games like Hyrule Warriors, and she’s playable as a ghost in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</em>; she’s also playable in <em>Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon</em> and 1996’s <em>Zelda’s Adventure</em>. But her appearance in this capacity — starring in her own game — has been long overdue. </p>
<p id="mZwD8r">The Legend of Zelda continues to be one of the most important video games series in Nintendo history, and it has continued to turn away from Zelda. Like, don’t get me wrong — I still love to play as my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22578543/zelda-skyward-sword-nintendo-switch-link-himbo">twinkified Link</a> and dress him up in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23725926/tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-best-hat-outfit-cece-mushroom-hat-how-to-get-slay">cute outfits</a>, but it feels right to try something new. I want to experience The Legend of Zelda as Zelda herself, and now I and a lot of other fans will finally get a real chance to do that when the game comes out on Nintendo Switch on Sept. 26. </p>

Sure, some years have popped off better than others, but there’s never really been a dearth of solid Nintendo games coming to the system. Part of this is likely because, whereas previously Nintendo had both consoles and handhelds to think about, the Switch now occupies all of the company’s attention by covering both markets, so even when the system is having a relatively “off” year, like it did in 2021, we’re still getting some solid GOTY contenders like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a></span>.</p><p>When the Switch has been at its best, we’ve gotten some of the best entries for Nintendo’s biggest franchises. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span><em> </em>changed open-world games forever, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a></span><em> </em>was a cultural moment for a franchise that had long deserved that recognition, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-gameplay-model-scarlet-violet-1849105177&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-gameplay-model-scarlet-violet-1849105177"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a></span><em> </em>was a true evolution of a series that had become stagnant, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1819856086&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1819856086"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of the most inventive games in one of the longest-running franchises in the medium.

This third installment was actually a prequel, so it tells the beginning of the adventure. Basically, you play as the 16-year-old child of a hero named Ortega, who was sent to defeat the villainous Baramos. Ortega failed, so the king sends you and a group of companions to finish the job.

The Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, some of it reserved for the OS. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. There's only one expansion slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford.</p><p>The PNY Micro SDXC card is compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, Steam Deck, and the ASUS ROG Ally. This specific PNY "Premier-X" model is actually faster than most other Micro SDXC card at its price point with a U3 A2 speed rating (most cards are U1 A1) with up to 100MBps/90MBps read/write speeds. The Nintendo Switch won't take advantage of such speeds, however, if you want to get a memory card for your smartphone, GoPro, DSLR, or any other device that can requires large data transfers on the fly, this is a great option.</p><p>Check out all of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals</a> for sales on other games and accessories.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 18, 2024 4:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is the latest addition to BioWare's iconic fantasy RPG franchise and is slated for release in 2024. The upcoming game is the fourth entry in the Dragon Age game series, and picks up where its predecessor--2014's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition/">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>--left off.</p><p dir="ltr">First <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dragon-age-revealed-in-first-trailer-featuring-solas/1100-6485329/">revealed in 2020</a> (after being teased during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/every-game-awards-winner-game-of-the-year-goes-to-/1100-6463733/">2018's The Game Awards</a>), the game was initially referred to as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, but had its title changed a few days before BioWare released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-introduces-your-buddies-in-thedas/1100-6524069/">the game's official cinematic trailer</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-shows-off-stylish-combat-hard-choices-and-unique-art-direction/1100-6524161/">20-minute gameplay reveal</a> in June 2024. Though there are still plenty of questions surrounding the highly anticipated RPG, the release of both trailers suggests that, as the game's Fall 2024 release date approaches, BioWare is finally ready to pull back the veil on The Veilguard and show players what kind of experience they can expect when the game launches.

Few details regarding the specs required to run the game on PC have been released, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" rel="nofollow ">the game's Steam store page</a> indicates that a 64-bit processor and operating system will be required for the PC version of the game.</p><h2 id="Why_was_Dreadwolf_renamed_The_Veilguard_">Why was Dreadwolf renamed The Veilguard?</h2><p dir="ltr">The first glimpse players got of the game referred to it by the title Dragon Age: Dreadwolf--a reference to one of Dragon Age: Inquisition's companion characters, an elf named Solas. Near the end of Inquisition, it is revealed that Solas is actually an ancient god named <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Fen%27Harel" rel="nofollow ">Fen'Harel</a>, a name which translates to "Dread Wolf" or "The Wolf To Be Feared" in Elvish.</p><p dir="ltr">But upon the release of the official cinematic trailer, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-gets-a-new-title-gameplay-reveal-coming-soon/1100-6523992/">the game has been renamed</a> to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Veilguard executive producer and BioWare general manager Gary McKay clarified the reason behind the name change in <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" rel="nofollow ">a blog post</a> on the developer's official website. Ultimately, the game's name was changed to shift focus onto the game's main group of protagonists--which include the player-character and seven NPC companions--rather than its antagonist.</p><p dir="ltr">"Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions--not your enemies--are the heart of this new experience," McKay explained.</p><p dir="ltr">"So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories, and how you’ll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas."</p><h2 id="Where_does_Dragon_Age__The_Veilguard_take_place_">Where does Dragon Age: The Veilguard take place?</h2><p dir="ltr">The Veilguard is set in Tevinter (also called the Tevinter Imperium). Tevinter is the oldest existing human-inhabited country in all of Thedas. Culturally, Tevinter places a great deal of emphasis on magic, and mages are treated with respect. Unfortunately, the nation also has a long history of slavery--specifically the enslavement of elves. For this reason, Tevinter is often regarded with ire by those who live outside its borders.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place in the nation's capital city, Minrathous, the game's cinematic trailer and gameplay reveal gave players their first good look at Tevinter. Unfortunately, the city has descended into chaos as a result of Solas' attempt to tear down the Veil, which serves as a barrier between the mortal world and the Fade, a place where spirits, demons, and other mysterious magical beings reside.</p><h2 id="What_is_Dragon_Age__The_Veilguard_about_">What is Dragon Age: The Veilguard about?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320866-baldliferuiningelf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320866" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320866-baldliferuiningelf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320866"></a><figcaption>The Veilguard revolves around the story of eight unlikely heroes who are determined to stop one very angry elf-god from tearing down the Veil.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320866-baldliferuiningelf.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard focuses on the aftermath of the events that take place in Dragon Age: Inquisition--namely Solas' quest to tear open the Veil, which he himself created. The Veil is all that separates the world of the living from the magical world of spirits, demons, and other dangerous creatures. In the gameplay trailer, we see the player-character and their companions doing their best to prevent Solas from destroying the Veil. This is no small task, as Solas is a god with immense power. The gameplay trailer sees Varric (a dwarf and former member of the Inquisition) doing his best to convince Solas to abandon his plot, as the entirety of Thedas will be effectively doomed should Solas succeed. Even with the ritual not yet complete, demons are already slipping through the Veil and terrorizing Minrathous' citizens.</p><p dir="ltr">Varric and Solas worked together in the Inquisition, and although Solas doesn't seem particularly happy to have Varric interrupt his Veil-shredding ritual for a last-minute chat, he still shows the dwarf mercy. In the blink of an eye, Solas destroys Varric's crossbow with a blast of powerful magic, but this act doesn't even come close to displaying how dangerous Solas truly is. The Dread Wolf has killed fellow gods, sealed others away for eternity, and even possesses the ability to petrify the bodies of his foes with a single thought.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not immediately clear why Solas has chosen Tevinter as the site for his ritual, though it could have something to do with the nation's history of elf-enslavement. But one thing is certain: Taking him down will be no easy task.</p><h2 id="Who_is_Dragon_Age__The_Veilguard_s_player_character_">Who is Dragon Age: The Veilguard's player-character?</h2><p dir="ltr">Instead of playing as the Inquisitor--a stereotypical "chosen one" similar to the Dragonborn in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/">Skyrim</a>--The Veilguard will see players take on the role of a relative nobody. Though little is known about the player-character, we do know they can be customized in a number of ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to the way <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s player-character is often referred to as Tav (despite players being allowed to give their character any name they wish), BioWare has nicknamed The Veilguard's player-character Rook, but players can name the character whatever they wish. Players can also customize Rook's appearance in a number of ways and can change their looks any time after leaving character creation.</p><h2 id="Dragon_Age__The_Veilguard_character_creation">Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creation</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320877-rook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320877-rook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320877"></a><figcaption>The Veilguard's player-character has been nicknamed Rook, much in the same way Baldur's Gate 3's protagonist was nicknamed Tav.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320877-rook.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When creating their own custom Rook, players can pick the character's race, gender, class, specialization, and faction, in addition to choosing one of four voices--two feminine, two masculine--for Rook to use during cutscenes and when commenting verbally during gameplay. Just like Inquisition, The Veilguard allows the player to choose between four races (human, elf, dwarf, or Qunari) and three classes (mage, rogue, or warrior). Each class has its own skill tree, along with three unique specializations for the character to choose from. No information is currently available regarding mage-exclusive specializations, but we do know which options are available to rogues and warriors (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>):</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Rogue_specializations">Rogue specializations</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Duelist:</strong> Focuses on movement, like dodging and parrying attacks</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Saboteur:</strong> Focuses on setting traps for enemies</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Veil Ranger:</strong> Focuses on long-range combat</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Warrior_specializations">Warrior specializations</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Champion:</strong> Allows the player to use a shield to avoid damage dealt by enemies</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Reaper:</strong> Allows the player to siphon health from enemies</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slayer:</strong> Allows the player to use the largest weapons in the game, increasing damage output</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Factions">Factions</h3><p dir="ltr">During character creation, players must choose from one of the following factions:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Antivan Crows:</strong> A group of sneaky, merciless assassins with a reputation for protecting Antiva whilst hiding in the shadows, unseen.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Grey Wardens:</strong> An old order of individuals who have sworn to protect the realm from <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspawn" rel="nofollow ">darkspawn</a> and other undesirables.

BioWare has confirmed that The Veilguard will not allow players to control their companions in combat the same way they did in Inquisition, which saw players jumping between different characters mid-combat, controlling each of them in a manner similar to the way players can control companions in Baldur's Gate 3.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1800547865175191632" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>The new customizable Ability Wheel - seen here in the early moments of the game - will allow you to control your companions' attacks and unleash powerful abilities.</p><p>As you progress more abilities will be added. 🌩️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DragonAge</a> <a href="https://t.co/woSbIdTrwI" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/woSbIdTrwI</a></p></div>  — Dragon Age (@dragonage) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1800547865175191632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Instead, the newly added ability wheel allows players to issue commands and prepare companion attacks while still controlling Rook. More options are added to the ability wheel as players progress through the game.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the player-character, Rook can attack in real-time or pull up their own ability wheel, pausing time while selecting an ability to use. Unlike Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Veilguard doesn't seem to provide a way to move the camera around the 3D environment while combat is paused, and it appears that enemies need to be within the player-character's line of sight to hit them with an attack via the ability wheel.</p><h2 id="Which_characters_are_available_as_companions_in_The_Veilguard_">Which characters are available as companions in The Veilguard?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320846-emmrich.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320846-emmrich.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320846"></a><figcaption>Emmrich is one of seven romanceable companions in The Veilguard, seen here with his skeletal sidekick, Manfred.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4320846-emmrich.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Unite-a-Team-of-Heroes-to-Defeat-Rampaging-Elven-Gods-in-Dragon-Age-The-Veilguard-Arriving-in-Fall-2024/default.aspx" rel="nofollow ">seven companion characters</a> in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but only two companions can join the player's party at a time, down from the three-companion party players had access to in Inquisition.

More details about each companion can be found below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bellara:</strong> Bellara is an elven mage and part of the Veil Jumpers faction, making her an ideal companion for missions that see the party coming into close contact with creatures from beyond the veil.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Davrin</strong>: Davrin is an elven warrior, and a member of the Grey Wardens.

They will engage in a romance with the player-character, provided the player-character manages to successfully woo them through dialogue options and specific choices.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the player's words and actions, The Veilguard features a new feature when the player is faced with a decision: useful context. As seen in the gameplay trailer, Rook is eventually forced to choose one companion to join him and help him knock over a massive statue, while the other companion stays behind and keeps the demons--who are spilling into the material world as the Veil weakens--at bay.</p><p dir="ltr">A decision-making menu then appears on the screen, forcing Rook to choose between taking Neve with him and leaving Harding behind, or vice versa. Interestingly, when he hovers over the choice to bring Harding with him, some text pops up that reads, "Harding will follow you into greater danger." The same text appears when hovering over the option to select Neve. This suggests that companions can be put in serious danger (and perhaps even prematurely killed) as a direct result of the player's choices, even in seemingly low-stakes situations like knocking over a statue.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, it'll be important to remember that, just like in Inquisition, if you dilly-dally for too long, your companion-of-choice may start romancing another NPC member of The Veilguard, so players will want to make sure they've made their move before they're out of time. That said, the game's developers have stressed that the bonds the player forms with each companion are a pivotal part of the game that they intended to be rewarding for every player, even if they don't choose to romance anyone.</p><h2 id="When_can_I_preorder_Dragon_Age__The_Veilguard_">When can I preorder Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2><p dir="ltr">No information on preordering Dragon Age: The Veilguard is currently available, though it can currently be wishlisted on Steam.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics - Announce Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The seven games included in the Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection are as follows:</p><ul><li>The Punisher (1993)</li><li>X-Men: Children Of The Atom (1994)</li><li>Marvel Super Heroes (1995)</li><li>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter (1996)</li><li>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter (1997)</li><li>Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash Of Superheroes (1998)</li><li>Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age Of Heroes (2000)</li></ul><p>This collection marks the first time the arcade version of The Punisher has been available on home consoles and PC, though it was ported to the Sega Genesis in 1994. All six fighting games have also seen a long hiatus on consoles--the most-recent release involving any of these games being Marvel Vs. Capcom Origins in 2012--and have appeared on multiple Arcade1Up cabinets in recent years.</p><p>Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will launch later this year for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

He also thinks overreliance on safe bets (aka established IP) will get the industry nowhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The vast majority of the planet has already said Grand Theft Auto is not that interesting, Call of Duty is not that interesting. [...] If people have already said they're not interested, building more of those experiences will not get them in."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">New ideas are all well and good, but Layden also believes patience is needed in gauging the market. Layoffs are happening now largely because of "artificial growth" during the pandemic, and some studios admitting their eyes were </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-overreached-with-big-bets-and-now-530-people-are-losing-their-jobs">bigger than their stomachs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Layden has no ill will for studios who took risky bets back then, but noted cooler heads are needed now.

Duviri Paradox is the best example of a recent update that introduced a lot of materials, but each update tends to include a couple. The release of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-jade-shadows-new-warframe-and-gameplay-details/">Jade Shadows</a> is no different, and how you can use them can be a little confusing.

During the mission, you’ll fight various enemies that will occasionally drop Vestigial or Volatile Motes, which can then be picked up.

Alternatively, you can use the Fast Travel option in the Pause Menu to go straight to Ordis. Here, you’re able to access several shops. The <strong>Release Vestigial Motes shop</strong> lets you access Jade’s component blueprints alongside other useful items such as Arcanes. Other shops let you spend your Volatile Motes on other assorted items, including several cosmetics.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-still-wakes-the-deep.904995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-still-wakes-the-deep/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-still-wakes-the-deep<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="390" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> takes the horror of the sea and drags it into a virtual reality where you’re small, trapped, and must try to escape an entity you cannot understand. It’s brutal cosmic horror that borrows from some of Lovecraft’s best work and manages to craft a survival horror game that I believe is going to be remembered by the horror community for years to come. </p> <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">Developer The Chinese Room is perhaps best known for games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dear-esther/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dear Esther</a></em>, narrative titles that do a great job of telling a compelling story through gameplay that’s generally okay.<em> Still Wakes the Deep</em> kicks things up a notch. Set on an oil rig in the North Sea in 1975, you play as Caz, an electrician who took a job on the rig to get out of Scotland and dodge some police charges. While his past has caught up with him, it matters little compared to the monumental event that occurs on the rig right after his boss gets wind of them. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> (PC, PS5 [Reviewed], Xbox Series X|S)<br>Developer: The Chinese Room<br>Publisher: Secret Mode<br>Released: June 18, 2024<br>MSRP: $34.99/£29.99</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">The opening to <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> is dripping with atmosphere. You’re introduced to a plucky crew around a rig that’s barely holding itself together, a flawed protagonist whose past is less than glamorous, and a first-person perspective and movement system that’s good enough to get around, but feels as clunky as a middle-aged Scotsman should. </p> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="870" data-injectable="true">Something that stuck with me from the outset and lasted all the way through is the exceptional visuals. At points, I struggled to understand how the game looked so real. The Chinese Room has pulled off some sort of magic with this game, and it makes the horrors you face all the more terrifying, because they seem to be bursting out of reality. That’s quite appropriate because, soon after the muted introduction, the rig drills into something, an entity, and all hell breaks loose on the platform. </p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">However, the visuals, like the movement system, aren’t perfect. An update may fix this, but the logic of narrow wires in <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> is, to put it bluntly, bonkers. It makes sense for enemies, but phones and other wiring will also go haywire and fly around in unnatural ways. Seeing these glitch in and out of existence or fly around for no reason broke my immersion, but at least they didn’t break the game. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true">After being thoroughly thrown around, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> reveals its true colors. What starts out feeling like a walking simulator very quickly becomes a first-person horror game, and I adore it. There’s a lovely split between environmental puzzles, things like switches and fires, platforming, and sneaking around or running away from colossal, impossible enemies. </p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">The environmental puzzles are a lot of fun. They’re all framed as fixing a system or finding an item that you need to help someone and progress, much like in the original<em> Dead Space</em>. This gives you a sense of purpose and helps you forget the scary parts until they suddenly rear their head again. Mechanically, these puzzles are simple, but the way they’re used throughout the game keeps it fresh without anything ever feeling overused. </p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">The enemies are where the real horror/fun is, though. Certain crew members have been altered by the entity the rig’s drill ran into. They’re bloated and barely human, but retain some level of intelligence and a few dangling limbs. The monster design is top-notch and grossed me out more than once. I even froze up a couple of times just because these creatures look like they were ripped right out of nightmares. </p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">You’re not fighting these things. Instead, you’re escaping them, working around an environment, sometimes quite a long series of rooms, while throwing objects to distract them. Some encounters even have you activating systems for the rig, which feels incredibly stressful when a giant blob of fishy human meat is moving around trying to absorb you. </p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">If this sounds a lot like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-alien-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien: Isolation</a></em>‘s Xenomorph encounters, that’s exactly what it feels like to play. Where in that game, the environment and your arsenal changed how you explored and worked around your enemy, S<em>till Wakes the Deep</em>‘s environment and enemy variety keep things from feeling dull. Even when you think you know how an enemy will react, it’s going to surprise you and keep you on your toes. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">It’s not just how these things look and move, either; it’s how they sound. Human voices have been distorted to sound like animals or certain personality traits that they had before being transformed. This debases them, but also makes them feel scarily advanced, because you just don’t understand why they’ve been twisted in such a way. </p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">The sound design, in general, for <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> is better than many AAA titles. Silence is used to devastating effect, but the soundtrack, where used, is superb. Every footstep, creak of metal, or groan from something in the distance is done so well that this game can scare you with the controller on the table and nothing happening. </p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">The Scottish voice acting is also just amazing. Most of my family is Scottish, and it felt almost homely to hear so many Scottish words used in passing that I’m sure a lot of people will miss. While some of it feels a little forced, the majority of the dialogue is stunning. It makes the game feel authentic, even though it’s packed with dreadful monsters. </p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">Lastly, there’s the story. The real narrative in <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> is told through flashbacks, your actions, and even the way the enemies look. In true cosmic horror fashion, the true nightmare lies within protagonist Caz’s mind, not the rusty rig falling apart around him. </p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">Similar to how the horror community still analyzes, dissects, and discusses <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-soma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soma</a></em> to this day, I can see <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> being a game that people find new ways to explore and explain for at least a decade. It’s well-made and clearly has a strong vision behind it, which I’d say has been nailed. </p>
 <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">I’ve always thought that the unknowable depths of the sea make for a terrifying realm to contemplate. We really have no idea what lies at the bottom of a large percentage of Earth’s oceans. That’s why it’s always seemed a little bonkers to me that we’re so willing to drill straight down into the crust below and hope for the best when aiming roughly where we believe there’s some oil.</p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="false"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> blends this terror with genuine human flaws. Outside of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dredge-indie-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-s-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dredge</a></em>, I don’t know if a game has felt so uniquely Lovecraftian. This is a game that everyone should play just to experience once, and thanks to its deathless story mode, you can. It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s noteworthy and a game you’re not going to stop hearing about for a long time, and it scratches the itch you’ll have been feeling since playing <em>Alien: Isolation</em>.</p>

Impressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/blud-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>#BLUD, or Becky the Vampyr Slayer, is a dungeon crawler in which vampires have descended upon the town of Carpentersville. Unfortunately for them, and fortunately for the townsfolk, a girl named Becky has recently moved to town and she just happens to come from a line of vampire hunters, though she’s not aware of that when we first meet her. She just wants to be a normal kid, doing normal stuff like attending school and going out with her friends. But, we don’t always get what we want in life, and Becky is thrust into being the one who has to stake her future peace on taking down the big-bad Dragur.</p>
<p><iframe title="#BLUD Gameplay Trailer | Humble Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lloxBJRIz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>#BLUD has one real stand-out unique element to it, and that is its Twitter-alike social media site, Perch. Perch is essentially Becky’s mission log, where other townsfolk and classmates can comment on the missions with updates and clues. Becky can also post selfies from around town and with people as well as enemies. These can offer further insight into the people living in Carpentersville, as well as provide other information about the foes that Becky will come up against. Where some games tack on internal social media, #BLUD makes it an integral part of the game. In addition to her social media, Becky has a grimoire, though many of the pages are missing or incomplete. As progress is made, new pages appear with knowledge about the different enemies, recipes, and spells. At first glance, it seemed that the recipes and spells section alluded to some form or crafting and magic use, but sadly that’s not the case as Becky doesn’t get to use any magic in her fight against the vampires.</p>


<p>#BLUD’s combat is pretty basic to be honest. Becky starts with just her fists to punch enemies, and the ability to dodge. Eventually, she gets her hands on a hockey stick which deals more damage than her fists. You get further upgrades including a shield, shovel, and a rope dart, which can be used in battle as well as to traverse certain areas in the overworld. The shield will block incoming attacks allowing for counter hits, the shovel digs out enemies that burrow underground, and the rope dart gives range. Becky is also equipped with pencils that are used as throwable mini-stakes for ranged attacks, along with cherry bombs that can do area damage.</p>


<p>In #BLUD, enemies have different strengths and weaknesses. So, teen vampires need to be parried before they can be attacked, while Reapers need to swallow bombs to be killed. There’s a good variety of enemies, with different ones being introduced regularly to keep things fresh, but there is a downside to them too. In quite a few battles, certain enemy types, like the feral vampire and teen vampire, just stopped engaging and stood around. To remind them that we were fighting I would have to thwack them with the hockey stick, pulling them out of their daydream reverie and back to the violent reality. There are boss battles spread through the campaign of #BLUD as well, with the majority being about hitting the enemy weak spots a few times. A couple of fun outliers do provide something different, including a school bus chase and a boxing match, but I wish there were more.</p>
<p>One of the key aspects of #BLUD is its visual design. Developer Exit 73 Studios has looked towards the cartoons of the 90’s for the world and character designs, and as someone who grew up on those cartoons #BLUD really does nail that aesthetic. When it comes to the games sound and voices, it feels like the development team has gone even further back, using Peanuts’ Miss Othmar, aka trombone voice teacher, as inspiration for the gibberish the characters speak.</p>
<p>Exploring Carpentersville and checking Perch will bring side quest opportunities, alongside the main campaign mission, with these offering different rewards too. The missions could be anything from stealing some lawn furniture to wiping out vampire nests in the hospital and they’re worth doing as you learn more about the town and the people you are helping. No mission really outstays its welcome, that is, until closer to the end of the game. Towards the close, there’s a story mission that requires visiting various locations around town to place an object. In one stage you have to navigate a labyrinth in the hospital, and I was close to getting soft locked here. There is a point where you must hit a big button to activate and deactivate bridges, but what can easily be missed is the barrier you can take down. I missed this and then got stuck trying to hit the button from range.</p>

<p>It was only after various goes that I managed to find the smallest of gaps to launch a pencil stake at the button to activate the bridge I needed. While, I should have paid attention there should not be any point where you can become forever stuck. Another part of the mission involved corridors of darkness, particularly the last one where there is no immediate source of light, allowing enemies to attack in the dark as well as falling into crevices. Both cause damage and if you lose your hearts its back to the last checkpoint, though thankfully, you do not need to redo most puzzles when you are sent back.</p>
<p>For all its charm, #BLUD does have other issues too. There was noticeable delay when quitting from the pause menu and back to the game, and a couple of times where Becky got stuck in the environment. The first time I tried to quit to the main menu and the game froze up, while on the second time the game did go back to the start screen allowing me to reload. These serve to take some more of the shine off what is a characterful indie title.</p>

            <p>
Following starring remaster turns for Pheonix Wright, Apollo Justice, and Ryunosuke Naruhodo, it's finally Miles Edgeworth's time to shine; Capcom has unveiled the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch on 6th September.
</p>
<p>
The newly announced collection includes two Miles Edgeworth led Ace Attorney spin-off adventures - both incorporating the series' usual mix of crime scene exploration and courtroom cross-examinations - starting with Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, which originally released for Nintendo DS in 2009.
</p>
<p>
It's the second included title that's perhaps most exciting, however, given that Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit - which initially launched for DS back in 2011 - hasn't previously had an official release outside of Japan.
</p>

<p>
Both games in Capcom's Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will feature HD visuals created by the series' original character designer, and there's the talk of more fluid character animations - and richer expressions - too. Players that want something closer to the original experience, however, can switch between the new and classic sprites if they choose. 
</p>
<p>
Other quality of life upgrades include a conversation history - so players can review important character chatter during their sleuthing - plus a story mode that effectively does all the gameplay bits automatically, enabling players to focus purely on the story. And finally, Ace Attorney Investigations Collection features a gallery mode including the likes of sketches, animations, promotional art, all 106 in-game background tracks, 23 orchestral tracks, one completely new track, and five newly arranged tracks from the first Miles Edgeworth game - and the latter can be switched in to replace the original music if that's your jam.
</p>
<p>
Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will be available for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Windows and Steam) when it launches on 6th September.

			<p>Nothing can keep a good party down, and during the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> the company announced the latest entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Party series</a>. Super Mario Party Jamboree boasts plenty of classic same-couch multiplayer madness, with over 110 minigames, some of which you’ll destroy your thumbs with, some of which are motion-controlled. Perhaps the most notable addition is the Koopathlon, which pits up to 20 players online in a mode that looks more than a little inspired by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fall-guys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall Guys</a>. Nintendo is also hinting at more yet-to-be-revealed modes as well. Check out the first trailer for Super Mario Party Jamboree, below.</p>

<p>Looking pretty solid! Mario Party may not be the choice of the badass hardcore gamer, but the series remains massively popular. Super Mario Party has sold over 20 million copies on Switch, Mario Party Superstars racked up 13 million, and Super Mario Party Jamboree looks like perhaps the highest-effort entry in the series on Switch yet. Need to know more about the game? Here’s the official Mario Party Jamboree description…</p>
<p><em>“Mario and friends are arriving on an enormous island resort for the latest entry in the Mario Party series. Explore five new game boards: ride the escalators in Rainbow Galleria, stay on track in Roll ’em Raceway and mix things up with an active volcano in Goomba Lagoon, just to name a few. Two boards from previous Mario Party games are making a return, too. In addition, over 110 minigames are available to play — the largest selection in the Mario Party series to date. Experience action-packed challenges, puzzles to test your wits and some minigames that feature motion controls. That’s not all — up to 20 players can go head-to-head in online play in the Koopathlon mode. The biggest Mario Party yet will soon be underway when Super Mario Party Jamboree launches.”</em></p>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree gets the celebration started on Switch on October 17.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24180447/valheim-the-board-game-mood-publishing-crowdfunding<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lEi5H8"><em>Valheim</em>: <em>The Board Game</em> was built off the success of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22912132/deep-rock-galactic-board-game-preview-interview-release-date-price-kickstarter"><em>Deep Rock Galactic: The Board Game</em></a>, another tabletop adaptation of a popular video game that aims to keep the same vibe as the original. With <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>, it’s easier to create a one-to-one experience — a match in the video game is a round of the board game. But <em>Valheim</em> is a sprawling experience that’s harder to encapsulate. <em>Valheim: The Board Game</em> is coming to crowdfunding on Gamefound later this year.</p>
<p id="HZV9ve">Playing on a <em>Valheim</em> server with a cohort of pals is a <em>big</em> experience, made up of weeks and months of farming, building, adventure, boss fighting, and general Viking antics. So how does the board game adaptation boil all of that down into a two-hour session? It’s no easy feat, but the designers looked to <em>Valheim</em>’s biomes and the altars that summon bosses like Bonemass or The Elder.</p>
<p id="0uRpsP">“The video game is expansive. Not only is it a typical adventure, but you start with nothing. You have to create a home as well. I think of it as an adult version of <em>Minecraft</em>,” says Ole Steiness, lead designer of <em>Valheim: The Board Game</em>. “What we’ve done is taken the same core concept and then divided it into scenarios of a larger campaign.”</p>
<p id="ZUTaGu">Each session of the board game represents a scenario of a larger <em>Valheim</em> life in the 10th realm. “You have to develop yourself and your home to be able to take on this challenge,” says Steiness. “You’re going to explore the map, which is going to be tiles on the board, and you’ll have events going on and creatures showing up to challenge you. As you fight your way through it, you gather resources so you and your friends can build up, make a cool character, a cool home, until you take on the big boss fight at the end of the game.”</p>

<p id="wILQE3">Different sessions of <em>Valheim: The Board Game </em>will have different layouts and scenarios that play out over a two-hour game session. Not all of the scenarios will be tests of martial prowess. “It was important to both us and Iron Gate [the developer of <em>Valheim</em>] that it’s not only about killing stuff — it’s about developing other traits and making sure that other parts work. Some people find it fun to build a house, or some people want to go explore. We have a 3D model of your home in the game, and it’s an empty house you have to fill out.”</p>
<p id="s0Plfs">In <em>Valheim</em>, new furniture and workbenches at the homestead raise your comfort level and allow you to craft new gear. That’s true in <em>Valheim: The Board Game</em> as well, which allows players to linger at home to enhance their equipment and build armor while others venture out into the Black Forest to kill monsters. In order to refine these roles, there are character archetypes: The Ranger is probably out scouting and fighting trolls, while the Sailor is focusing on securing naval routes, and the Gatherer gathers up everything needed for a nutritious stew. Everyone can do everything, but these roles allow players to specialize in a way similar to the original game.</p>
<p id="cAQtr8">The board will also change depending on the boss you’re fighting. Bonemass, for instance, will cause the board to be populated with more swamp biomes and poison tiles. When the endgame begins, the players flip the board, revealing a boss arena for the final showdown. </p>
<p id="5PYpI5"><em>Valheim: The Board Game </em>will be available to back on Gamefound later in 2024. More details will be released on <em>Valheim</em>’s <a href="https://x.com/Valheimgame">X feed</a> and community <a href="https://discord.com/invite/valheim">Discord</a> as they become available.</p>

That game where all you do is click a banana is now one of Steam's most popular releases ever. In fact, it is so popular, it has today bopped both Hogwarts Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 down a place on Steam's most played games chart. 
</p>
<p>
Banana - as the game is aptly called - is now sitting proudly in ninth place on Steam's most played games charts in terms of all-time player peak. 
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, that peak is 884,469 banana clickers, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak">SteamDB</a>.

<p>
To put this in perspective, Hogwarts Legacy (which became the best selling game of 2023 in the United States, surpassing sales of Call of Duty) has an all-time player peak of 879,308. It is now the tenth most popular game on Steam. </p>
<p>And, as for the wildy-praised and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">multi-award winning Baldur's Gate 3</a>? It is now out of the Steam top 10, with an all-time player peak of 875,343.</p>
<p>
"Banana is a clicker Game, in which you click a Banana! In Banana you click the Banana to gain even more Bananas," reads Banana's synopsis on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/">Steam</a>. "Every 3 and 18 hours, you get dropped a banana. Each banana is also made by the community in Discord. Come hang out with us and let's grow into something awesome!"

			<p>PlayStation's Liverpool-based studio Firesprite has now issued an official statement following the layoffs several months back.</p>
<p>Back in February of this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony announced</a> that it would be cutting 8% of its PlayStation workforce. Impacted studios included Guerrilla Games, London Studio, Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Firesprite - the studio co-responsible for Horizon Call of the Mountain for PS VR2. "<em>Our philosophy has always been to allow creative experimentation", </em>PlayStation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-its-two-new-ceos-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming co-ceo</a> Hermen Hulst said back in February.<em> "Sometimes, great ideas don’t become great games. Sometimes, a project is started with the best intentions before shifts within the market or industry result in a change of plan."</em></p>
<p>Fast forward four months, and Firesprite has <a href="https://x.com/FirespriteGames/status/1803012313596801044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now released</a> an official statement on X about the unfortunate layoffs, offering gratitude to those affected. "Like several other teams across SIE and PlayStation Studios, Firesprite was impacted by redundancies announced in February of this year", the statement reads. "These past few months have been an incredibly challenging period for our studio whilst we underwent a difficult and lengthy consultation process. During this time, we have been focused on providing support to all those affected amidst these demanding circumstances.</p>
<p>The statement continues, "As the consultation process now draws to a close, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude to all of the incredible and talented colleagues who will always remain a part of our story. We face the future with resilience and determination, united in our vision to deliver unforgettable gaming experiences to our players."</p>
<p>We can only wish those affected the best and sincerely hope that they have since found a new job.</p>

Since then, the game has received a handful of updates as the live-service journey begins and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span><em> </em>evolves and changes over the coming months and years. </p><p>“Launch has been great,” said Rubin. “We’re extremely happy with our player numbers. It’s gone far beyond what we expected.”</p><p>Rubin explained to <em>Kotaku </em>that Ubisoft had tried to keep the game “pretty lowkey” and “grassroots.” The idea was to build a game and a dedicated community of players at the same time. However, the massive influx of new players and eyeballs since launch isn’t a bad thing. </p><p>“This tells us that gamers are genuinely interested in what we’re doing and are enjoying the fun gameplay that we’ve created,” explained Rubin. <br></p><h2 id="h133832"><a id=""></a>How Ubisoft plans to fix and balance <em>XDefiant</em></h2><p>However, while a lot of people have hopped into Ubisoft’s new F2P shooter, there have been some complaints from players about hit registration issues and desyncing problems. Basically, players are sharing clips of being killed behind a wall because on the other player’s screen they hadn’t made it to safety yet. Or they’re sharing videos of players being shot, but not taking damage as you would expect.</p><p>“We’ve had a great launch so far, but it has come with some issues. We own that and we’re not trying to hide from it,” said Rubin. </p><p>“This is the first FPS powered by the Snowdrop engine. So with that comes a lot of work to reconfigure the engine. And we’re finding new things all the time. There are growing pains, but in a good way for this team.” </p><p>Rubin further added that as a “live game” the real work is just beginning and they “absolutely” will continue to fix, tune, and improve “every part” of <em>XDefiant</em>.<br></p><p>With millions of players yelling online about problems, balance, and changes, I wondered what Ubisoft’s philosophy was for updating <em>XDefiant </em>and possibly changing its meta with a patch. Creative director Safy Saada explains that the team waits long enough to get plenty of data and then combines that with player feedback. </p><p>“As <em>XDefiant </em>evolves, we will keep finetuning the game,” said Saada. “We know we’ll always have [an] evolving meta and that’s a key element for this type of game.” </p><p> Saada says every time the team adds something new, like a faction or weapon, they’ll “probably have to rebalance” existing content. The creative director did confirm with <em>Kotaku </em>that Ubisoft plans to use “private test servers” in the future to “ensure its first iteration” of a change is as balanced as possible. </p><h2 id="h133833"><a id=""></a>Bunny hopping in <em>XDefiant </em>isn’t going anywhere</h2><p>One hot topic among the playerbase right now is bunny hopping in <em>XDefiant</em>. This is the act of players hopping up and down in different directions in firefights. At launch, players complained it was too easy to bunny hop and get kills, so in a recent patch (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/dj0iHxeSeSIcjkiH3Hxi8/xdefiant-y1s03-patch-notes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/dj0iHxeSeSIcjkiH3Hxi8/xdefiant-y1s03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which went live after this interview</a></span>) Ubisoft added some aiming accuracy penalties to b-hopping. But many players are still not happy about the current jumping meta. </p><p>“The intent of our movement has always been clear to us. We want there to be a skill gap,” said Rubin. “We also want there to be players saying, ‘I’m learning, I’m getting better at this game, I’m learning how to use the tools that the game has.’” </p><p>Rubin confirmed to <em>Kotaku</em> that it won’t be “nerfing” bunny hopping “into the ground.” But, as we saw with the recent accuracy penalty update, the team is still tweaking movement and the hops. </p><p>“We had an intent. And looking at that intent, we realized there were some things that needed to be adjusted,” said Rubin. “We’re adjusting the attributes on things like jump and other parts of the game to better suit the intended design that we wanted. Our intent was to always have <em>XDefiant </em>be a skilled FPS with good clean feeling movement that’s not overly complex, but is fun to master.” </p><h2 id="h133834"><a id=""></a>Making <em>XDefiant’</em>s fan-favorite maps</h2><p>The game’s various maps are one area of <em>XDefiant </em>that has received near-universal praise from fans and critics alike. While a couple of them aren’t as great as the rest—looking at you “Times Square”—the majority of <em>XDefiant</em>’s 14 maps are fantastic, rivaling the maps found in many other popular shooters. </p><p>Saada says he and the team are “super happy” about how <em>XDefiant</em>’s maps have been so well received by the community. According to the creative director, the maps in <em>XDefiant</em> are one of the game’s “key pillars.” I asked Ubisoft what goes into making a good arena shooter map, and Saada told me the team always tries to “start simple” and that the devs “really wanted to go back” to the original three-lane maps found in older <em>Call of Duty</em> games and similar shooters of the era. </p><p>“Then, the interesting part is bringing in what’s fun about the Ubisoft IPs we’re using,” said Saada. </p><p>In the game’s next season, starting on July 2, Clubhouse from <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> will be added to <em>XDefiant</em>. And while that Ubisoft tactical shooter is known for its destructible environments, <em>XDefiant </em>can’t match that kind of gameplay. However, Ubisoft still found a way to “celebrate” the game and its destruction.<br></p><p>“[Clubhouse in <em>XDefiant</em> looks] like an <em>R6</em> match just happened, with a lot of holes in the walls and floors as a part of the way we designed our lanes,” explained Saada. “So it’s really about mixing iconic flavors and elements from our titles with solid proven designs.”<br></p><h2 id="h133835"><a id=""></a>The challenges of making something like XDefiant</h2><p>A lot of work goes into developing, launching, and then maintaining an online video game.  I asked if Saada thinks players don’t realize how complicated these games are to develop, and he said that players know more today than 20 years ago.<br></p><p>Saada also said that even the team, made up of experienced devs, didn’t quite realize the “amount of work” involved with a game like <em>XDefiant </em>until they actually started to make it. He also said that while making a game like this takes a lot of time and energy, it’s also a “very fascinating” process. </p><p>“To start with just an idea and work all the way to the point where it gets in the hands of players and then making that idea evolve while experiencing it with the players, it’s a fascinating process,” said Saada. <br></p><p><em>XDefiant </em>is out now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Its new season starts on July 1.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-factions-just-dance-cleaners-dedsec-interview-1851540972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-factions-just-dance-cleaners-dedsec-interview-1851540972"><em>We also spoke to Ubisoft </em></a></span><em>about how it picks which factions to add to XDefiant and if the panda dancer from Just Dance will arrive in the FPS one day.</em><br></p><p><em>&nbsp; .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-kitty-island-adventure-might-be-your-next-favorite-cozy-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hello Kitty and the Switch seem like a perfect match…provided the framerate issues get resolved.</h2></div><section><p>Hello Kitty Island Adventure surprised me in the best way possible. Where I expected a lower-production value Animal Crossing-like game painted in Hello Kitty colors, made to cash in on Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ runaway success, and put in front of the lucrative mobile audience, the demo I played presented me with so much more. I explored, made friends, and completed challenges around an island in an early version of the Switch port for Hello Kitty Island Adventure.</p><p>Hello Kitty Island Adventure was originally released on Apple Arcade last year, blending management sim-like mechanics with light exploration, platforming, and puzzle solving to create a comprehensive cozy adventure. Think Animal Crossing or a less intensive version of Stardew Valley combined with A Short Hike or the exploration and quest systems you’d find in a 2D Zelda game. If you’ve played Animal Crossing, you’ll find a lot of this game’s setup pretty easy to parse out. It’s all about building out your island and inviting cute Sanrio characters to live on it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Hello Kitty Island Adventure - First Nintendo Switch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I checked out an early story quest for about half an hour. I helped My Melody find new clothing stands for her clothing shop while playing as an adorably chunky, self-designed cat in a Gudetama outfit. I stumbled across so many small, fun diversions while looking around that kept me engaged during what would otherwise be a simple fetch quest in the starting area.</p><p>One task had me reliving Mario 64 Red Coin challenges as I raced to pick up a handful of pink coins in a quick timeframe. Another was less of a deliberate challenge and more of a collectible: statues of Gudetama, Sanrio’s lethargic egg mascot, are scattered around the island for you to photograph. I only found two or three of the 132 ovate statues peppered around the island, but you’ll be rewarded with special decorations, clothing, and other rewards for every 12 that you find and capture with your camera.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These little diversions are admittedly small, but infusing microscopic platforming and puzzle challenges into the management sim-like quest structure adds so much value to your time. It encourages you to go off the beaten path and explore. That coin challenge I mentioned earlier, for example, led me to find a new item.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Infusing microscopic platforming and puzzle challenges into the management sim-like quest structure adds so much value to your time.</p></div><p>After that, I started on a story quest that helped me unlock a swamp-like section of the island, which in turn helped me make new friends, like Keroppi. My demo ended pretty soon after I unlocked this new area, but I was blown away after a look at Hello Kitty’s full map, which dwarfed the starting area. My half-hour with Island Adventure was clearly only the tip of the iceberg.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Developer Sunblink has been supporting and supplementing Island Adventure with free content updates Since its original release on Apple Arcade almost a year ago, regularly adding new characters from Sanrio’s surprisingly deep roster of characters to befriend. While the developer I spoke with didn’t confirm any details about who or what we should expect to see in the future, they’ve promised full parity with the mobile version day-and-date when it launches on consoles and PC next year.</p><p>Sunblink has done such a good job supporting its Apple Arcade hit, in fact, that my only concern with its future is its Switch port. The demo I played was presented on Switch and it ran pretty poorly. It was still playable, but it dropped a concerning number of frames. It’s an issue that I sure hope will be ironed out by the time Hello Kitty and friends make the jump to Nintendo’s handheld-console hybrid, but knowing what we’ve seen in other ports to the Switch, I’ll believe it when I see it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Chugging performance aside, I had a great time running around the island with Saniro’s charming stars. Whether I was doing mild platforming or completing a quest, I was consistently impressed with how and where Island Adventure took opportunities to give me stuff to do as I completed story quests. Fans of cozy games or someone who’s looking for a fun adventure for a younger gamer should keep their eyes on Hello Kitty: Island Adventure if they haven’t already had a chance to play it on Apple Arcade. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s certainly the case for the Dragon Quest games, which are ripe for remakes in this vein and one reason why the initial announcement of Dragon Quest 3 was such a big deal. Now, after three years of radio silence, I was finally able to see the Dragon Quest 3 remake first-hand and despite the new graphical update, it’s exciting to see that this is very much a faithful recreation of the decades-old original.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I got to play roughly 45 minutes of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake on PlayStation 5, and as someone whose gaming life revolved around RPGs of its era, I certainly appreciate a good modernization of one. Much like other Square Enix HD-2D RPGs Octopath Traveler and Live-A-Live, it’s further proof that this direction is such an effective way to preserve the look and feel of classic pixel art with visual flourishes that are only made possible by today’s technology.</p><p>The demo starts early on in the story when the hero picks up a full party consisting of a Warrior, Cleric, and Mage. From the hero’s hometown of Aliahan, I ventured out onto the open region to travel to the northern town of Reeve. Here and in the overworld, the lighting and bloom effects give a pop to an already vibrant old-school look. Although the lay of the land remains the same, its redesign gives the world a greater sense of scale. Promontory Passage, which is the ruins that leads to the Dreamer’s Tower (the first dungeon), are a stark contrast from the original and the environmental details paint a much more lively picture that wasn’t previously possible. Even compared to the mobile remasters of Dragon Quest 3, the difference is night and day, yet it didn’t feel like I was playing a completely different game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unsurprisingly, gameplay mechanics are largely preserved with turn-based battles that unfold after choosing actions for each party member. Strategizing with spells and attacks in the hope they line up to take out enemies before they inflict too much damage on your party is the Dragon Quest way. Although I was only playing early levels with a limited number of options, I already know that because of its branching class-based system, Dragon Quest 3 can definitely ramp up in complexity. I regrettably killed many adorable Slimes in my short time playing, but facing Toadys, Bubble Slimes, and Stark Ravens in groups (and in succession when climbing several floors of Dreamer’s Tower) would be dangerous if I wasn’t smart with my spells and who I was targeting. So, I was happy to see this remake preserve the kind of difficulty that made the originals especially challenging.</p><p>Unlike those originals, which had a pop-up window in which battles took place, combat encounters transition to a full screen scene with some neat details. The party lines up before commands are issued, then it transitions to a pseudo-first-person viewpoint. While you don’t really get to see characters animate or attack in battle, there are at least a handful of new special effects when casting spells that weren’t there in previous versions. While the remake stays true to the originals in this respect, it’s one area where I hoped more inspiration would come through, to give party members a little more personality in combat.</p><p>And so, part of me wishes this remake was more drastic in its creative liberties and quality of life changes. The stiff character animations combined with the vivid HD-2D makeover don’t always work that well together, resulting in an uncanny valley effect that sometimes looks out of place. Combat also lacks snappiness – you can change the text box and battle speed to maximum but the awkward pacing from one attack to the next makes things a bit stilted. These seemingly minor blemishes really stand out, especially after other HD-2D RPGs, and I feel Dragon Quest 3 could better bridge the gap between modern and classic design principles.</p><p>Of course, ask 10 different people how far they think a remake should go in terms of changing the original and you’ll likely get 10 different answers, and regardless of these early shortcomings, I can still appreciate the fact that a classic 30-plus year old RPG is being revitalized in 2024. The heart of turn-based RPGs are timeless so even something like Dragon Quest 3, which remains steadfast in most of its original design with a very simple story, can still evoke the joy of the genre. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The difference is night and day, yet it didn’t feel like I was playing a completely different game.</p></div><p>It’s not a radical overhaul then, and if you’re coming fresh off other HD-2D games like Octopath Traveler 2 or Live-A-Live, you should set your expectations accordingly. But I do think it’s important to not just preserve older games with modern sensibilities but make them more approachable as time goes on. The HD-2D foundation once again proves to be nearly foolproof when it comes to recreating that classic charm and a great way to modernize an old RPG that many would not have otherwise revisited.</p><p>We’ll be able to see it all come together when Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 14 this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-announced-along-with-3-remake-release-date-nintendo-direct-2024">Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD-2D Remakes are also set to release</a> sometime in 2025, completing the original Erdrick triology in the series.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's the next full entry in the long-running Mario Party series and it's set to release on Switch on October 17, 2024.</p><p>It's themed around an island resort and features large maps like a race track called Roll 'Em Raceway with map-specific mechanics and a hazardous volcanic board called Goomba Lagoon with environmental hazards. Along with five brand-new boards, Mario's Rainbow Castle from Mario Pary 1 and Western Land from Mario Party 2 are also part of the roster of boards in this new game. There will be over 110 minigames featured in Super Mario Party Jamboree including a few that take advantage of Joy-Con motion controls. There is also a separate online competitive mode for up to 20 players to take part in minigames.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The last Mario Party game was Mario Party Superstars back in 2021, which was a celebration of the series' history. It included five classic boards, 100 of the series' best minigames, and a bunch of other throwbacks that really tickled those of us who remember old school Mario Party. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-party-superstars-review">Our review called it</a> "the best Mario Party has been in a very long time." We were slightly less impressed with its predecessor, Super Mario Party, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/03/super-mario-party-review">still called that</a> "far better paced than recent games," saying it "reset expectations of the series."</p><p>For all the reveals, be sure to check out our full roundup of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">everything announced during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
