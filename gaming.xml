			<p>For those who have been waiting for a new installment in the Metroid Prime series since August 28, 2007, somehow, now that we're 20 days away (at the time of this writing) from the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the waiting feels even more excruciating. At least in the lead-up to December 4, 2025, Nintendo is putting out new trailers to help tide players over in the last stretch of this long, almost two-decade wait.</p>



<p>The latest overview trailer is a significant look at gameplay, as it goes through several of the game's key systems, showcasing the main game mechanics players will interact with and utilize over the course of Samus' latest adventure.</p>



<p>It also features a solid look at the Galactic Federation soldiers who put out the distress call that Samus responds to at the start of the game, the same call that brings her to the planet Viewros. It seems like these allies will be with her for most of the game, which is definitely a shift from the classic Metroid style of Samus being the lone warrior adventuring out on her own.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Last week, at the one-month mark ahead of the game's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-trailer-ups-the-ante-month-from-release/">a new action-packed trailer </a>showed off some stunning cinematic shots of the game. Now that Nintendo put out another trailer a week later, it feels like that might have been the start of a month-long marketing campaign that'll lead into the game's launch. If that's the case, it'll be great to regularly see more of the game as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Back in April, shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech got to preview the upcoming long-awaited release, with our Nathan Birch writing</a>, "<em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Nathan's feeling that there's a game worth the wait on the way remains true when it arrives on December 4, 2025, on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

              <p>If you want to take fitness seriously, you need a good smartwatch on your wrist. Ideally, it should offer a nice mix of health and connectivity features, plus have a reliable battery life for all-day use. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Garmin makes some of the best, outdoor-friendly options out there, and you can pick up the Forerunner 55 for less.</a></p>
<p>The watch has dropped to $150 on Amazon, after a nice $50 discount. It’s one of the lowest prices Forerunner 55 has ever dropped to, and the discount applies to all color options. Prefer your wearables classic? Go for the Black option. A pop of color is more your thing? The cool Aqua option is discounted as well! The offer, however, is selling fast, which means you don’t have a lot of time to grab it. It’s best to make the move fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Punches Well Above Its Weight</h2>

The interface is easy to use, and you can even customize your watch with free watch faces, data fields, apps, and widgets from the Connect IQ Store on the Garmin Connect app.</p>
<p>It helps you track all the ways you move, whether it’s just simply walking, taking a run, swimming, doing cardio, enjoying pilates, or even cycling. There are built-in activity profiles for each of these, where you can log your progress of the day. There’s built-in GPS to track where you run, plus get insights into distance covered, pace, intervals, etc.</p>



<p>You will also get daily run recommendations of different intensities based on your training history and recovery time, as well as a whole bunch of free training plans that adapt to you and your goals. Those preparing to race will appreciate the PacePro technology that offers GPS-based pace guidance for any selected course. You can also choose a race distance and get an estimated finish time to help you stay on track.</p>
<p>Other helpful features include stress tracking, body battery energy monitoring, menstrual cycle or pregnancy tracking, and respiration tracking. When connected to your phone, you can receive emails, texts, and other alerts right on your wrist. The battery is designed to last up to 2 weeks in smartwatch mode, and up to 20 hours in GPS mode.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this watch, but be sure to get your orders in before the deal expires.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-offline-24-hours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-offline-for-24-hours-to-deploy-1-0.1353706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has just been pulled offline by Battlestate Games for a whopping 24 hours, and potentially longer if the 1.0 rollout needs to be extended. This is to allow the teams at Battlestate to deploy the complete overhaul coming with the 1.0 version of the game, which is the culmination of more than 10 years of development.</p>



<p>Tarkov going offline is a significant moment for the game, as when it comes back up, nothing will ever be the same again…</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-back-online">When is Tarkov Back Online?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be back online when the 1.0 update has been deployed. Battlestate Games has stressed it will be 24 hours from 11:00 GMT, which means 11:00 GMT <strong>tomorrow</strong>, it should be ready to go. When you boot tomorrow, you’ll be loading a new version of Escape from Tarkov, and for the first time in eight years, it <strong>won’t be a beta</strong>.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version comes with a new map, weapons, and equipment, and much more besides. The game will wipe and introduce a new campaign that players can follow to ultimately <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, securing one of four endings to wrap up the game’s core loop.</p>



<p>PvE players will need to wipe their game (but it’s not mandatory) if they want to complete Escape from Tarkov’s new story.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-error-262-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is Error: 262 in Escape from Tarkov?</h3>



<p>Don’t worry, this is just the error message Battlestate Games has applied to the Escape from Tarkov launcher while the 1.0 deployment is being rolled out.</p>



<p>This weekend, a Twitch Drops campaign will go live, with thousands of streamers coming forth to broadcast the 1.0 version for the first time. Typically, a Tarkov wipe heralds a monumental time for the game, and it skyrockets on platforms like Twitch. This will be no different, as this is the most significant event in the game’s storied history.</p>







<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov is likely back and (we hope) better than ever. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re most excited about from the 1.0 Tarkov update.</p>

            <p>On the reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers yesterday, there was one big question on everyone's lips. Why is it not coming to PlayStation?</p>
<p>After all, Horizon is one of Sony's most prolific first party franchises, with over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">30m copies sold across PC and PlayStation consoles</a>. But, despite this, the upcoming Horizon MMO from NCSoft is currently only slated for PC and mobile. What gives?</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In the time since Horizon Steel Frontiers' announcement, executive producer Lee Song has shed a bit more light on why NCSoft's game isn't coming to PlayStation, suggesting excluding the platform was not NCSoft's decision.</p>
<p>The Horizon Steel Frontiers developer told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">4Gamer</a> that a lack of PS5 release was the "most comment reaction" following the announcement (via machine translation). He added that NCSoft has "no reason" not to bring its game to a PlayStation console.</p>
<p>"We would like to do it," the developer continued, "but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions."</p>
<p>It's been speculated, therefore, it may be Sony's decision not to release the game on PlayStation. Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>
<p>In related news, earlier today Guerrilla's studio head celebrated Steel Frontiers' announcement with the revelation that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-horizon-series-was-always-thought-about-as-a-multiplayer-game-says-studio-head-following-mmo-announcement">team had always imagined Horizon as a multiplayer game</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters.1353682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>I recently got to go hands-on with the Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and not just to play that opening section that everyone and their mum has played at this point. No, I got to play over an hour of one of the game’s earlier parts proper, once Samus has appropriately lost all her abilities because the plot demands it.</p>
<p>I can’t say I was sceptical of the whole psychic angle for the new abilities, but I wasn’t <em>completely</em> sold, either. More fool me, as Metroid Prime 4 leans into the psychic schtick more than I expected, and does so in a way that blends nicely into the gameplay you expect, but is also refreshingly different to classic Metroid Prime fare.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s not breaking any major boundaries or anything, but it is <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>For example, there are these little glowy orbs called Psychic Motes that you need to use your special psychic glove to attract and throw into appropriate receptacles in order to open certain doors. You do this using the scan visor (trust me), which is now also the psychic visor (told you to trust me).</p>

<p>You can also use your powers to move certain objects from a distance in a manner that somewhat resembles the motion control nonsense from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, but far less invasive and rhythm-breaking. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>Not only did I manage to unlock all of this within about 40 minutes, but also another ability that allowed me to fire a charged shot which could then be controlled as it flew, slowing down time in the process to make it even marginally controllable. Honestly, it was a tiny bit too slow for my tastes, but I understand that not everyone is as great as I am.</p>
<p>And if you’ve even glanced at any of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4s-sweet-new-trailer-builds-the-hype-for-next-months-launch">the trailers</a> that have been released, you’ll already know that the game is absolutely stunning. The lighting engine doesn’t always hit the mark (as shown in the trailers within a desert area, which was sadly not a part of this preview), but when it does, it <em>really does</em>. The audio design is also stellar, especially the soundtrack. That mysterious, lonely vibe that is quintessential to the Prime series is here in full force, and I am unbelievably grateful for that.</p>
<p>What I’m not grateful for, however, is something that happened just under halfway through my playtime; Samus saves a marine from the snarling wildlife, and he decides to follow her like a worthless little worm, and brings his sub-Marvel humour along with him.</p>

<p>Mackenzie (presumably named after the least socially adept member of <strong>The Inbetweeners</strong>) is fully voice-acted, and reminds you of this fact <em>constantly</em>. I don’t want to blow things out of proportion, but he really did tarnish my time with the game, as not only does he keep yammering away with such classic lines as "Watch out, if you go that way I won’t be able to protect you," but I was also forced to protect him numerous times as I escorted him to a room he mercifully felt comfortable to stay in.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Samus barely engages with him. It would’ve been heartbreaking to hear one of my favourite video game characters break her stoic silence for this clown, so to have the maximum response she gives be a simple nod (even if said nod resulted in him hanging around even more) was a blessed relief. She didn’t even once say "the baby".</p>
<p>My hope is that Mackenzie is saved and sent home nice and early and never spoken of again, or better yet, suffers a painful, embarrassing death offscreen. But we’re going to have to wait until we can play the full release to know for sure. I tried shooting him with a missile, but it didn’t do anything.</p>

<p>If anyone thinks I’m being a little unfair, one of the biggest and most important parts of the Prime series (and the Metroid series as a whole) is the feeling of isolation, loneliness, and that you’re being forced to fight against the environment that doesn’t want you there to begin with. That notion is entirely destroyed once you introduce a character that blathers away at you incessantly, and it'll be a crying shame if this is something that is present throughout the full game’s runtime.</p>
<p>That being said, the rest of my time with the game was excellent, so I’m hopeful that it’ll all be enough to still make Metroid Prime 4 an absolute delight. I’m crossing two of my fingers, and you should too.</p>

<p>Not long to go!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>With just a few weeks to go until release, Nintendo has shared a new 7-minute overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer gives us our best look yet at what we can expect from Samus' hotly anticipated adventure. There's a detailed rundown of the planet Viewros, a summary of Samus' sweet new abilities (as well as some returning favourites), and quick look at some of Galactic Trooper friendly faces that you'll have to save along the way.</p>

<p>The trailer dropped early on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, but we've now added it in its full YouTube glory at the top of this post — enjoy!</p>
<p>And if you want to hear what we make of it so far, you can check out our full <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">preview</a> below — including our preliminary thoughts on those Galactic Troopers...</p>

		<p>Darling, listen up because I’m only saying this once,&nbsp; from today until December 14th, Balenciaga has swanned into PUBG Mobile and turned the whole battlefield into a catwalk for people who like their couture with a side of carnage.</p>
<p>It’s all terribly <em>now,</em> sweetie.</p>


<p>Exclusive items, special rewards, a whole World of Wonder map smothered in Balenciaga. It’s like Paris Fashion Week got drunk and wandered into a warzone.</p>
<p>Models… I mean, players, can unlock all these divine little Balenciaga numbers, the sort of pieces that whisper “high fashion” and scream “don’t touch me, I’m expensive.” There’s the Couture Armor look, inspired by that delicious 3D-printed armour couture moment from Balenciaga’s 52nd show. Very sculptural. Very futuristic. Very “I’m going to obliterate you but make it fashion.”</p>
<p>Then there are all the Winter ’25 bits — the corseted hoodie, the pink puffer, the standard look, it is Balenciaga saying, “Yes, we know you’re in a firefight, but do try to look couture”</p>

<p>And it doesn’t stop there, sweetie. You can also get the Invisible Rectangle Sunglasses (perfect for pretending you haven’t slept in three days), the Faux Fur Helmet (lush), and a Balenciaga Backpack in three upgradeable levels — because even your virtual luggage should be aspirational. Parachutes, avatar frames, graffiti, space gifts, so much to buy!</p>
<p>In World of Wonder, there’s a whole official Balenciaga map, where you can faff about expressing yourself — ghastly concept — but at least there’s a chic snowboard involved.</p>

<p>And of course, because Balenciaga never misses a chance to dress you.. normal.. people, there’s a real-world merch capsule too: T-shirts, caps, keychains, all that “I holiday in Monaco” nonsense. You can pick it up at select Balenciaga stores and online in Australia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the UAE, and the US.</p>
<p>Now, where’s the Bolly?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/14/metroid-prime-4-beyond-final-preview-psychics-and-sidekicks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-final-preview-%E2%80%93-psychics-and-sidekicks.1353673/</guid>

		<p>The wait for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is almost over, a new first person, 3D adventure for Samus for the first time in 18 years. Heck, it’s been 8 years since this game was announced, and now it’s a cross-gen release for Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>! Having gone hands on with a more extended portion of the game’s opening, has it been worth the wait?</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Final Preview – Psychics &amp; Sidekicks" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GT-zzppAAk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game’s opening sees Samus answer a distress call from a Galactic Federation base besieged by the Space Pirates. It’s always felt a little funny to me how sparse the Space Pirate forces were during previous games. You’d be blasting your way into their base, but only really encounter them one or two at a time, giving far less of an impression of a galaxy-spanning threat than they’re made out to be in the series’ expanding lore. Similarly, the Federation come off as utterly helpless and incompetent, outside of knowing when to call Samus for help. Metroid Prime 4’s opening finally gives a proper sense and feeling of how these two might face off, with giant, stompy mechs, Space Pirates dropping into the fray, and a desperate battle to escort a mysterious artefact to safety.</p>


<p>It all goes rather wrong, with a stray shot from Space Pirates leader Sylux hitting the artefact and absorbing everyone into a big glowy explosion of psychic energy – yes, they’ve finally decided to embrace new management after reanimating the skeleton of Ridley for the thirtieth time.</p>
<p>And that’s when things get really quite strange. Finding herself on a totally different planet known as Viewros, Samus is confronted by an alien race, the Lamorn, who have died out but wishes for their legacy to be preserved, and have tasked Samus with doing so by heading to five nearby regions and biomes.</p>


<p>So, Samus has been stripped of many of her abilities, but the artefact has seen fit to grant her with some new ones. Psychic ones! Samus’ visor? That’s psychic now. Her armour? It’s enhanced with a new psychic glove. Her morph ball? It lays psychic bombs. But this does all come to mean something more than just making everything purple – the most psychic of colours, as we all know. When scanning the environment, Samus can now spot things like power nodes and door locking mechanisms, reaching out to manipulate them in various ways as part of the environmental puzzling. Similarly, you quickly gain the ability to fire off a charged shot and then guide it remotely with the world in super slow motion.</p>
<p>Taken alongside the series staples of just shooting everything in sight with various elemental gun types, morph ball bombs, and using enhanced movement, all of this this brings a different tone to the exploration. You might need to convert morph ball bombs into psychic energy motes to charge a mechanism, a door blocked from one side might now be opened with a guided bolt, or just use telekinesis to shift some stuff around. It’s an intriguing new aspect, though I’ll admit there were a few moments where I didn’t quite put two and two together during these puzzles. There are layers of possibilities that now need to be remembered together, I feel, with the psychic abilities relying on switching to the visor view to trigger them. I’m sure this will become more natural through longer play in the full game.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of playing Metroid Prime 4 are slick and smooth, though. The core controls and feel are those of a modern first person shooter, though there’s also some leanings back to the older style of Metroid Prime controls as well. There’s no aiming down sights, but the left trigger will instead lock on that will snap to targets in a satisfying way, so you can just blast away. There is some motion control after touch while doing so, which did take a moment of getting used to, but allows for targeting weak spots.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can switch to mouse mode, if you’re playing with Switch 2 and detached Joy-Con 2 in hand. It’s effortless to switch back and forth between console gamepad controls and mouse mode, simply by tipping your hand on its side so the mouse sensor is on a table, sofa arm or trouser leg. This immediately gives you free aim, again making it easier to quickly target weak spots.</p>

<p>That really comes to the fore during boss battles, the first of which sees a Metroid-enhanced Space Pirate monster covering glowing blobs on its body with forearm shields, forcing you to target the exposed area, and then later hitting tentacle weak spots on a giant carnivorous plant. Regular combat encounters have also got bigger than in classic Metroid Prime, with many more enemies and waves of them coming in from multiple angles. It can be quite frantic. Frantic enough, maybe, that Samus could maybe use some help?</p>
<p>This brings us to what I feel will be one of the most controversial additions to Metroid Prime 4. One of the key aspects of this series and the genre it spawned has always been the sense of isolation, while still allowing for degree of human contact for mission briefings and updates. Well, Specialist Myles MacKenzie will seriously undercut that tone.</p>

<p>After saving him from being stranded on a vine-ensnared transport, and then from a horde of Jungle Griever enemies, he joins Samus for the next leg of exploration, and fight alongside with his pistol. That’s fine, but…. Myles is chatty. He will tell you to consult your map, he’ll marvel at Samus’ morph ball, he’ll be all ‘quirky’ during cutscenes in that Marvel movie kind of way. I fear that he will grate in the long run, though it’s not too long before he stays behind at a control panel and lets Samus get some alone time once more.</p>
<p>Sadly our time with Metroid Prime 4 came to an end after exploring this first region, and before getting to hop on the new motorbike to explore the open desert area between regions. That looks like it could be a lot of fun and a real change of pace.</p>
<p>In general, I enjoyed my time with Samus’ latest 3D adventure. It’s long overdue, of course, and there’s a tonal shift from close to two decades difference in game design and script writing. Hopefully that doesn’t skew too heavily away from the classic isolated feel of Metroid, but I’m certainly keen to see how the full game has come together.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell Ryzen 7 Laptop Bundle (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) Is Almost 70% Off, Savings You’ll Never See on a MacBook]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-ryzen-7-laptop-bundle-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-is-almost-70-off-savings-youll-never-see-on-a-macbook-2000644033</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Grabbing a powerful, sturdy laptop from a known brand doesn’t have to put a dent in your wallet. We’re spotting plenty of early Black Friday deals dropping in left, right, and center across different retailers. Amazon, specifically, is offering a wide range of high-end laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/">For instance, the 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3535 touchscreen laptop is currently sitting at just $800 at the retailer, which is a massive 64% off its retail price of $2,200.</a> It’s packed with tons of useful features that are sure to support you during busy workdays and even make those late-night entertainment sessions a lot more fun. Alongside the direct discount, you’re also getting several handy accessories thrown in for free, including pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. The offer, however, is only around for a limited time, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Processor to Work, Stream, and Game Easily</h2>
<p>The laptop runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor, delivering impressive performance that even outpaces Intel’s i7-1355U in most competing models. Paired with AMD Radeon Graphics, the machine is more than capable of handling everyday work, browsing, streaming, and even light gaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>There’s 32 GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. It makes using demanding applications, as well as multitasking, a breeze. You will be able to work with different programs at the same time, take video calls, create presentations, push some creative boundaries, hop through tabs, and more; without a hint of lag. Best of all, storing everything locally won’t be an issue either. Dell Inspiron 3535 packs a massive 1TB SSD that offers enough space to house a ton of high-resolution photos, videos, programs, and even games without feeling limited. Plus, SSDs ensure fast boot/load times, so you won’t have to wait long to get started.</p>



<p>Display-wise, you’re covered with a modest 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) touchscreen. Its narrow border maximizes the overall space, while the built-in Dell ComfortView technology keeps the screen easy on your eyes. Touch support means you don’t have to limit yourself to the trackpad or the mouse to navigate. When you’re not in the mood to press buttons, simply use your fingers directly on the screen to scroll long documents, swipe through photos, sketch, and even take notes!</p>
<p>Some other features that deserve a mention include the 720p HD webcam, ergonomic lift-hinge keyboard, Wi-Fi 5, and Bluetooth 5.0. All things considered, this laptop is great for work, studies, and even casual use.</p>

                <p>Valve has a new Steam Machine on the way next year, but if you have a long memory, you'll remember that this isn't the first time that the company has attempted to bring PC gaming to the living room. The original line of Steam Machine mini-PCs launched back in 2015, but poor sales eventually saw these devices fade quietly into the background. So what's to stop history from repeating itself? According to Valve, a better video game catalogue and an effort to give developers an easier time when porting games over to the new Steam Machine are some of the key factors that the company has focused on.</p><p>"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier. So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux that are originally meant for Windows," engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it's really about the games catalogue," fellow engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais added. "Being able to control your TV, boot directly into the game, launch games, and install them in a way that meant you didn't have to install drivers, or that you didn't have to clean up your system after you installed and uninstalled a couple of games--all of those elements were there. We just didn't have a really compelling games library."</p><p>Griffais explained that developers also wanted to be assured that there would be an audience for their games to justify the effort spent on porting them, and that Valve worked on creating a machine that could reliably run games on it and offer an impressive layer of performance. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-machine-has-overlap-with-traditional-consoles-but-its-not-one/1100-6536196/">In another interview</a>, Griffais mentioned how Valve was aiming to make PC gaming "work better" in the living room, a space traditionally dominated by video game consoles.</p><p>The Steam Machine is currently scheduled to launch in 2026--alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">new Steam Controller and Steam Frame VR headset</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">but pricing for it has not yet been revealed</a>. Valve has said that it wants the Steam Machine to be "affordable," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-is-the-steam-machine-even-for-industry-expert-weighs-in/1100-6536186/">and one industry expert</a> believes that price "sweet spot" could be $400.</p>

Aim-assist is nothing new in Call of Duty (and many other games), but people are saying developer Treyarch went too far with the changes to aim-assist following the beta. Other people say it's great.</p><h2><strong>What Treyarch said about aim-assist changes</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a blog post</a>, Treyarch said its goal was to "create a more balanced and competitive experience for all players, regardless of input choice." Another important element for Treyarch was to "preserve the core feel of Call of Duty controller gameplay."</p><p>Based on feedback from the beta test, Treyarch said it learned that people playing on controllers have a slight advantage to win shootouts at close range. Keyboard and mouse setups, meanwhile, displayed a statistical advantage at long ranges.</p><p>Treyarch went on to say it also monitored player feedback on rotational aim-assist and made changes for launch based on that. "Based on the data and feedback, our launch adjustments focus on the strength of rotational aim-assist at short and long range, as well as the requirements to fully activate rotational aim-assist," Treyarch said.</p><h2><strong>What players are saying</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 players just getting started with the game have shared their opinions on the aim-assist changes online. Professional player <a href="https://x.com/CoDClipped/status/1988971829537697825" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shotzzy</a> said, "I feel like I have no aim-assist. I'm not even trolling." Others have said it's the <a href="https://x.com/Follow_Henrique/status/1988953891422236768" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"dumbest decision"</a> to change aim-assist in this way. Other people have said <a href="https://x.com/xcellerations/status/1989101650523636131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dialing back aim-assist in this way shows how good you really are at Call of Duty</a>, and that can be humbling. A lot of people are <a href="https://x.com/PhantXmBLXZE/status/1989261492454293781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">enjoying and embracing the aim-assist changes</a>. As usual with any given topic on the internet, opinions are all over the place.</p><h2><strong>Could Treyarch change aim-assist?</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 is a live multiplayer game and Treyarch has the ability to make ongoing changes, and that could happen based on feedback. "We look forward to hearing your feedback on these changes, and we will be gathering more data to continue our push for a level and competitive playing field in Black Ops 7," Treyarch said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is out now for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It's also playable via Xbox Game Pass, and you don't have to pay the new, higher rate, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">most major retailers have not adopted Microsoft's 50% Game Pass price hike.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 campaign review</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-tips-for-multiplayer/2900-7104/" data-ref-id="2900-7104">tips for multiplayer</a> in the gallery below.</p>

This week the company unveiled a new hardware lineup with a console-like PC at the center, built around SteamOS. The pitch is surprisingly similar to where Microsoft wants to take Xbox—but Steam is the home of the massive PC gaming library, not windows. It's not going to topple Xbox (or any other console) overnight, but a polished multipurpose PC that easily works on your TV raises the question—what's the point of a console anyway?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rockstar hit with legal claims by IWGB over firing of unionizing workers"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstart-hit-with-legal-claims-by-iwgb-over-firing-of-unionizing-workers">Rockstar hit with legal claims by IWGB over firing of unionizing workers</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer// </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The fired Rockstar workers aren't going down without a fight.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have come together to unlock the Stella Montis map through a community donation event, which they completed in just one day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">The event</a> required Arc Raiders players to donate a substantial amount of basic resources to an in-universe effort to unblock the North Line. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-first-major-community-unlock-event-has-been-made-harder-mere-hours-after-launch-as-players-were-completing-it-too-fast">It was made increasingly difficult after the community was blasting through it in a matter of hours</a>, though even this change by the developers didn't manage to hold off the Arc Raiders community for long.</p>
<p>As of writing, players are playing their first few games in Stella Montis and discovering all the secrets hidden on this new map. Not so secret are the new Arc enemies, which includes the Matriarch. This giant robot is already chewing through players with an overly aggressive onslaught of varying attacks.</p>

</figure>
<p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that the event was finished so quickly, considering how many people have flocked to it over the past few weeks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">The game has shot past four million copies sold</a> according to Nexon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">and continues to surpass its own Steam concurrent user peak as time goes on</a>.</p><p>This substantial update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-secretly-had-duo-queue-for-days-will-be-fully-supported-going-forward">duo queue was suddenly added to the game</a>, following fierce demand from players who weren't happy playing either solo or as a full squad of three. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">Whether or not players will remain friendly in Stella Montis</a>, or will give into their murderous desires as new loot is up for grabs, will be determined this weekend.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not check out Eurogamer's review</a>! In it reviewer Rick Lane summarises the game as such: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

<p>What's that? Huh?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>What's that, huh? Well, it's a new commercial for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> from Nintendo, and rather than the usual overenthusiastic voiceover to explain basic features, we've instead been treated to a weird, albeit quite wonderful rap song.</p>
<p>Yes, this is one of those ads things that will either go down in history as one of the best things Nintendo has ever put out, or perhaps one of the worst. We'll let you be the judge of that. At the very least, it's bringing back memories of the DK Rap from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, and that can only be a good thing in our book.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, we'd love to see this featured on primetime TV between episodes of Eastenders or Corrie. Just imagine Eastenders ending on the biggest cliffhanger ever and then <em>boom</em>, Kirby rap. Cinema.</p>
<p>It's all good fun, and we'll take it. Kirby Air Riders is launching on Switch 2 on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>, and you can once again get your hands on it this coming weekend with the Global Test Ride. This features Lessons, Air Ride, and City Trial game modes with multiple playable characters and vehicles.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-making-microsd-cards-the-next-game-cartridges.1353616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Deck changed the way I buy and play games. Just like how the Nintendo Switch blew me away with how it let me play the latest and greatest Nintendo games on the go and on a TV, the Steam Deck has drawn me in with how it offers a vast catalog of PC games that I can play portably or on a big screen. And with the Steam Deck’s microSD card slot, I can add a lot more storage just by tossing in a tiny memory card, meaning I can bring even more games around with me on the device.</p><p>But with its new Steam Machine PC and Steam Frame VR headset, Valve is about to make any microSD cards you use with the Steam Deck even more useful. Like the Steam Deck, both of those devices also run Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS operating system, and both have microSD card slots, too. So if the microSD card you’ve plugged into your Steam Deck is formatted for SteamOS, any games you’ve stored on it will be immediately visible by the Steam Machine and Steam Frame as well.</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a> launch in early 2026, this microSD card support means you’ll be able to take the devices out of the box, slot in your microSD card from your Deck, and start playing most of your games without having to download them again. There might be differences in how well games play across the three devices because of their different specs. But many games will probably work well on all of them, meaning you’ll be able to drop your microSD card into whichever device you want to use and just start playing.</p><p>Basically, your microSD card will almost function like an old-school game cartridge, but instead of it being limited to one piece of hardware or one single game, you can easily bring as many games as can fit on the card to whatever SteamOS PC you’re using at the time.</p><p>However, Valve is only building UHS-I card readers into these devices. UHS-I is <em>slow</em> compared to state-of-the-art microSD or internal SSDs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23761845/pc-games-ssd-minimum-specs-starfield-cyberpunk-2077">They may not be able to keep up</a> with every game you want to play, even if most will load fine. Meanwhile, Nintendo has already moved on to supporting the much faster microSD Express format with the Switch 2 (though has arguably also taken a step back by introducing Switch 2 cartridges that are a “key” and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">don’t actually contain games</a>).</p><p>“SD cards are notorious for having low performance, but from our testing and our experience, they actually work really well,” Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <em>The Verge</em> while showing us the Steam Machine at Valve’s headquarters. “For most people, the option makes the most sense, in our opinion.</p><p>When we asked to clarify the spec of the microSD reader, Aldehayyat added, “What we’re trying to emphasize here again is we really want the Steam Machine to be a really easy, super convenient device” that you just plug in, sign into, and start playing games on.</p><p>It’s a key part of what makes Valve’s new hardware feel like part of a cohesive ecosystem, and it could be an important advantage as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818622/valve-console-wars-price-sony-microsoft-nintendo-windows">enters the console wars</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The rough beast that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has cracked its shell and slouched towards the wincing light of day. They've released it, I mean. No verdict from us yet: our reviewer is still picking their way among the exploding motorbikes and mocking spectres of deceased Nicaraguan terrorists. But I can at least tell you with some confidence that if you're a fan of pausing games or mid-mission checkpoints, you might want to give it a miss.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">Eurogamer</a>, neither pausing, nor mission checkpoints, nor playing the game offline are allowed in the new Blops, thanks in part to its heavy focus on four player co-op play. You cannot look away from Blops anymore: it has become the Eye of Sauron, transfixing you from across the coffee table as it zooms to flaming close-up. Your time belongs to the cod! It sleeps with the fishes. Damn, I could see a mafia-themed Call of Duty set in Mordor, actually. It doesn't sound like this would be wholly out of synch with the endgame, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-basically-gun-speed-dating-and-its-endgame-is-a-big-fight-in-map-soup">entangles maps from Blopses gone by</a>. Collage Of Duty, they definitely aren't calling it.</p>
<p>This isn't the first Call Of Duty campaign to be always-online. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-missed-that-the-black-ops-6-campaign-is-always-online-but-fortunately-its-not-too-late-to-throw-a-wobbly">Black Ops 6 went there too</a>, and that game sold like hot yellowcake uranium, so clearly a significant proportion of you aren't fussed. Still, no mission checkpoints?</p>
<p>There are other and more pressing reasons to no-sell the new Call Of Duty. It's being published by Microsoft, who like buying studios for billions and then laying loads of people off, and who continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">do business</a> (despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">individual divestments</a>) with armies participating in what the UN has formally termed a genocide. We did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">a big report</a> on protests against the company's Israeli military connections earlier in the year.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="426">Spring cleaning is too far away. You need to stay on top of it all year long. Tidying up once a week keeps things manageable, and with the right tool, it doesn’t have to feel like a chore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, Amazon has the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for a whopping 55% off, dropping the price from $600 down to just $270.</a> That’s a $340 savings — not bad for one of the best vacuums in the game.</p>

<p data-start="1214" data-end="1546">Since it’s cordless, you won’t have to deal with the constant unplug-replug routine as you move from room to room.

<p data-start="1758" data-end="2078">And if you’re dealing with pets (or just a lot of hair), the Dyson V9 Motorbar really shines. It includes a hair screw tool with a clever conical design that prevents long hairs from getting caught, wrapped up around the brush. That means less maintenance and more effective cleaning on pet beds, car seats, stairs, and couches.</p>
<p data-start="2080" data-end="2274" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">If you’ve been putting off cleaning because it feels like too much work, maybe it’s time to get a vacuum that actually makes it easy.. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, the Dyson V9 Motorbar is more than half off, sitting at just $270 for a limited time.</a></p>

    <p><span>Dialyn and Banyue join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [28 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “On the Precipice of the Abyss,” will launch on November 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1006879"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Following the Timesworn Hill crisis, an intertwined adventure unfolds in the old mining site as the Miasma begins to recede from the depths of the Lemnian Hollow in this new update. The arrival of agents Dialyn and Banyue from the Krampus Compliance Authority introduces not only new allies to the battlefield, but perhaps new judgment agendas as well.</p><p>With the assistance of the Krampus Compliance Authority—a TOPS-affiliated enforcement organization tasked with disciplinary oversight—the Proxies successfully averted a disaster beneath Timesworn Hill and glimpsed deeper mysteries waiting within Yidhari’s dreamscape. Fleeting visions revealed the figures of Sarah and Ye Shiyuan together—an unexpected sight, given that the senior member of Yunkui Summit is not thought to be involved in the conspiracy of the Exaltists and their Creator. Meanwhile, his younger sister, Ye Shunguang, now ascended as the new master of the Qingming Sword, joins the Proxies to embark on a journey to uncover the truth. As the Miasma recedes, the old mining site buried a decade ago resurfaces, hinting at new dangers and unseen forces stirring once more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1006882"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Amid the shifting order and chaos, two agents join the fray. Dialyn, an S-Rank Physical Stun Agent from Krampus brings her experience as a cheeky customer service specialist to the battlefield. Using two unique resources, Customer Complaint and Positive Review, she excels at stunning enemies while calling up teammates to directly unleash their Ultimate abilities in combat, amplifying the team’s damage. Banyue, an S-Rank Fire Rupture agent and a revered martial arts master, has fused countless techniques into a combination style of immense power and splendor. His combat technique relies on alternating Adrenaline and Wrathful Fires to sustain his continuous actions and fluid combos, rewarding players who master his rhythm.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Two new Bangboo companions also join the battlefield in Version 2.4. Birkblick from Krampus features a multifunctional sensor array that transforms into a floating cannon during combat, scanning and bombarding targets with energy blasts. Meanwhile, the cheerful Bild N. Boolok wields a massive block hammer to smash enemies.</p><p>Beyond these new arrivals, Version 2.4 also welcomes back Agents Hugo (Attack – Ice) and Ellen (Attack – Ice). The beloved Bangboo auto chess event also returns with new upgrades—now featuring PvE special stages and offering exclusive rewards, including a free Bild N. Boolok. Meanwhile, the event Lightstream Notes invites players to enjoy New Eridu alongside Ye Shunguang, discovering fleeting moments of lightheartedness amid the deepening shadows.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,281 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,793 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.3 special program below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160495/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Video games are good. The internet is <em>good</em>. Sometimes, it’s hard to remember that nowadays, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> — the second visual novel from Kinmoku — is determined to remind us of the impact of online communities and the relationships we forge through playing video games. It’s also the most accurate depiction of online life in the mid-2000s I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>The year is 2003 and Emmett is a 15-year-old German kid who loves his Kinmoku Shark, a fictional games console that is essentially a desktop Nintendo DS. He’s playing Feudal Fantasy, a game recommended to him by one of his online friends. He also spends a lot of time on Videoverse, an online social platform akin to something like MySpace or ye olde message boards; think Steam, but cooler with pixel art avatars and two-tone colour schemes.</p>
<p>The majority of the game takes place in Videoverse, where Emmett chats with his friends about games and users post messages and <strong>Miiverse</strong>-like doodles. Here, you can respond to messages, ‘like’ drawings, and DM your friends.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160492/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game beautifully allows you to foster a positive environment by choosing how you respond. These responses can lead to small quests that you can follow in the background. But even when there was a chance to be a little meaner, it always felt <em>wrong</em>. I couldn’t bring myself to put down a stick-man drawing at any point. Why should I? I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of nasty comments online.</p>
<p>But Videoverse doesn’t shy away from the sour side of the internet; after all, the Shark is an ageing console, and with an upgraded model (the Dolphin) on the horizon, the devs slowly start to pull away from Videoverse. As a result, moderation starts to slip, and hateful messages, ranging from homophobic insults to ableist comments and lewd drawings, trickle through. A space once considered safe to so many, where they could proudly proclaim their sexuality or escape from real-life troubles, suddenly becomes toxic and hostile. Tempers bubble over, anxieties flood the art pages, and relationships fray.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/4913/embed @ 1763125204 -->
<p>It’s scarily accurate, and you can see just how that side of the online world has exploded over the past two decades. But Videoverse remains emphatically positive in the face of hate: I reported every nasty message I saw, and I always tagged other players and lifted them up when they felt down. Kindness is always the right thing to do here, and the writing is beautifully accurate to the 2003 time period. I was (and still am) a liberal smiley face user back in the mid-2000s — though there was a bit more XD and ^_^; than (: — but it’s all here in Videoverse, complete with typos and abbreviations.</p>
<p>Along with the writing, the general aesthetic goes such a long way to selling the nostalgia of the era. The interface is all 1-bit with bold colours (and changeable themes you unlock by commenting and reporting), customisable avatars, and lo-fi music that clearly evokes old gaming lobbies and chill spaces. Special shoutout goes to the incredible Feudal Fantasy animated cutscenes that help frame the entire narrative, too.</p>
<p>Sadly, navigating Videoverse on Switch can be a little cumbersome. You can use buttons or touchscreen, but both have drawbacks. Moving a cursor around the screen with the analogue stick is sluggish and fiddly; sometimes it disappeared mid-conversation, while other times it was distracting. The touchscreen is better, but it's so easy to select the wrong option or accidentally skip dialogue as you click through options.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160491/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But Emmett’s central relationship with a brand new user, Vivi, who attracts his attention thanks to her fantastic art, is the central story here, and it's strong enough to pull you through any input irritations. The two form a friendship which starts off awkward and shy but blossoms into something affirming. I had a friendship just like Emmett does with Vivi, though it was with someone I knew in real life. We spoke almost exclusively through MSN Messenger (remember that?) despite living in the same town and going to different schools, but we’d write stories together, talk about life, what we were reading, listening to, playing…I miss it</p>
<p>It's for this reason that Vivi’s character and her relationship with Emmett hit me the hardest. Not knowing whether you’ve upset someone, said the wrong thing, or not knowing what's going on in someone's life that you care about is heartbreaking, and the game captures that perfectly. The writing is already excellent throughout, but it’s between these two where it truly delivers, shining yet another light on what community and video games can really do for people.</p>
<p>Do I wish some of Emmett's other relationships had that same depth? A little! MarKun666, for instance, is the Feudal Fantasy fan; Emmett and him have met in real life and are close, always encouraging each other and having fun. But it rarely goes beyond that. Zalor, meanwhile, is having trouble with his online girlfriend Tifa-Chan, and by the end it feels like that whole situation gets swept under the rug.</p>

<p>But that’s a part of life, right? People move on, and sometimes you never find out what happened to those you spent hours chatting with or reading posts from. I’ve lost contact with many friends I’ve made online, and it’s a scary reminder of the ephemerality of the digital world. But those connections <em>can</em> last outside of that space, and — most importantly — their impact certainly does.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be where I am today without those hours-long chats on Messenger. I wouldn’t have a job writing about video games if I hadn't played <strong>RuneScape</strong> online or discussed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tales_of_symphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a> with like-minded strangers on message boards. The internet may feel like a black hole of hate and AI-generated content in 2025, and the games industry is rife with layoffs and accusations of workplace abuse, but I cling to the hope and the human relationships I’ve formed in both of these spaces. Behind every avatar is a human, and Videoverse clings to that very same notion.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Videoverse is a perfect time capsule of early online communities, never shying away from difficult topics and always approaching them with a smile. Its nostalgic wrapping works wonders for Millennials who grew up with a mouse or console in hand and who have made friends online.</p>
<p>While I wish there were a few more chats with other characters, and the Switch may not be the <em>best</em> place to experience it due to input frustrations, Videoverse is a tonic for the soul that the online world needs now more than ever.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5l5wetmus2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on the social network BlueSky by Gematsu, the GRAC (Game Rating and Administration Committee), the South Korean game rating board, has officially rated <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?c7b8077c36ff1119491eb25bd5560ffba6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?f0d05826089a46822d078e3eb6681337a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is a Dead Man</a> today.</p>



<p>The first one is CAPCOM's new science fiction intellectual property. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in June 2020, ahead of the release of the new consoles (Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox SerieS and X), Pragmata was scheduled to launch in 2022, but it received several delays. Just when fans had nearly lost hope of ever playing it, the third-person action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced this June with a gameplay trailer</a> and the promise of a 2026 launch window. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to play the game</a> at Gamescom 2025, and CAPCOM later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the fan speculation</a> that it was a 'secret Mega Man game'.</p>



<p>The GRAC rated the game for ages 12 and up with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>An action adventure game about the protagonist 'Hugh' and the android 'Diana' joining forces to defeat enemies and return to Earth.</li>



<li>Mild violence (battles hostile robot/AI forces using weapons).</li>
</ul>



<p>Romeo Is a Dead Man is also a sci-fi action/adventure game, although it is developed by Grasshoppers under the luminary guidance of Goichi Suda, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed at Gamescom 2025</a>. Those familiar with Suda51's games will know his games generally include mature themes, and indeed, the GRAC prohibited the game to minors with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>A sci-fi action adventure game in which the protagonist, Romeo Stargazer, becomes an FBI space-time special agent, Deadman, and chases down wanted criminals who travel across time and space due to time paradoxes.</li>



<li>Excessive violence (attacks using various weapons, frequent large amounts of blood, and various expressions of bodily harm.</li>



<li>Specific expressions of vulgar profanity and vulgar language (use of vulgar profanity and vulgar language such as “F<em>ck,” “Shit,” “F</em>ck,” “F*cker up,” and “Motherfucker”)</li>



<li>Excessive expressions that induce fear and disgust (creation of a terrifying and disgusting monster and atmosphere, expressions of blood and bodily harm that induce disgust).</li>
</ul>



<p>More than the ratings themselves, though, there's the fact that the GRAC usually rates games only when they are close to their scheduled launches. This year, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was rated</a> four months in advance of its debut, for instance, and the same happened to <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-version-gets-rated-by-south-korean-game-rating-and-administration-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good and Evil Anniversary Edition</a> in 2024.</p>



<p>In all likelihood, then, both Pragmata and Romeo Is a Dead Man are launching in the first half of 2026, and their definitive release dates could be announced very soon, possibly at the upcoming The Game Awards event. CAPCOM is gearing up for an explosive calendar year, between <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> (out on February 27, 2026), Pragmata, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gamescom-hands-on-preview-two-heavens-as-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, which is likely coming in the latter half of 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="586">If you’ve been thinking about hitting the gym more consistently or finally trying to get better sleep, there’s one simple secret to success… tracking your progress. Data doesn’t lie, and it’s one of the best ways to actually measure improvement and stay motivated. Whether you’re looking to crush your fitness goals or figure out what’s messing with your sleep, having a smartwatch that keeps tabs on your habits can make all the difference. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">Right now, Amazon’s running a deal on the Apple Watch SE (3rd Gen), making it a solid opportunity to upgrade your routine for less cash.</a></p>
<p data-start="588" data-end="925">Normally priced at $249, the 40mm Apple Watch SE is now 20% off, bringing the total down by $49 to just $200. If you prefer a slightly larger display, the 44mm model is also part of the sale. It’s usually $279, but the price has been slashed by $50, which means you can grab it for only $230 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="927" data-end="1260">For those who want to stay connected without carrying their phone everywhere, the cellular versions unfortunately not part of the discount. The 40mm cellular model is still sitting at $299, while the 44mm cellular model is hanging back at $329.</p>
<p data-start="1262" data-end="1568">The third-generation Apple Watch SE comes with an OLED Retina display that’s bright and clear, even under direct sunlight. With up to 1,000 nits of brightness, your screen stays easy to read whether you’re checking your pace when out on a run or glancing at notifications while getting a workout in at the gym.</p>


<h2>Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2068">When it comes to fitness, the SE acts like a personal trainer on your wrist. You can log workouts in the Health app, monitor your heart rate, and keep track of your daily steps. It’s genuinely satisfying to close those tri-colored activity rings each day. It’s kind of like keeping a streak alive on Duolingo or Wordle, but for your health. Plus, the watch includes safety features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS, which could literally save your life in an accident.</p>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2068">The Apple Watch SE is also swimproof up to 50 meters, so it’s great for laps in the pool, open-water swims, or even a full-on triathlon.</p>
<p data-start="2070" data-end="2328">The Sleep app gives you detailed insights into your sleep stages, showing when you’re awake, in core sleep, or in REM. That data can help you tweak your nighttime routine and actually wake up feeling refreshed instead of groggy.</p>
<p data-start="2474" data-end="2733" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">You can snag the 3rd-gen Apple Watch SE in midnight black or starlight white, starting at just $200</a>. Whether you’re trying to push your workouts further or finally take control of your sleep, this deal is a pretty great reason to make the upgrade.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It might be a sign of the times, or just a strange decision on Activision and Treyarch’s part, but the campaign aspect of Black Ops 7 cannot be paused, meaning you have to keep playing and progressing until the mission is over, or you reach a checkpoint.</p>



<p>Yes, this marks the first time ever that you can’t pause a Call of Duty campaign. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘s campaign utilizes an always-online aspect, meaning the game is live at all times. This has several huge implications for your game and means progress and progression can be interrupted at all times.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-can-t-be-paused">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Can’t Be Paused</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s pause for a minute, oh wait. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7’s campaign has attracted a lot of discourse because of the nature of its content. One thing that can’t be overlooked is the campaign being always online. In previous games, when you pause the game, the action stops. End of story.</p>



<p>That’s not the case here, and the action carries on—think of it like a FromSoftware game where you bring up a menu, but the world is still active. You can die, lose your progress, and go back to the start of the checkpoint. This isn’t ideal when you’re playing on Veteran difficulty, for example.</p>







<p>ModernWarzone also shared a clip of someone’s campaign journey, and while the user is trying to watch a cutscene, Black Ops 7 suddenly decides in that moment to drop the Daily Update.</p>



<p>This instantly derails any campaign momentum and throws you out to the main menu.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since Black Ops 7 is an always online campaign without the ability to pause, even if playing solo, when there is an update pushed it will interrupt your campaign regardless of where you are and what's happening. </p><p>Glad I didn't lose any progress at least. <a href="https://t.co/ofOXPLSvQD">pic.twitter.com/ofOXPLSvQD</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1989121314154770702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Treyarch might enable some kind of offline workaround later on, but this is unlikely due to the game’s online integration and the addition of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-worlds-collide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Collide</a>.</p>



<p>Is this a bad move from Treyarch? Does this put you off playing the campaign altogether? Head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let us know what you think of this decision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a new Escape from Tarkov 1.0 trailer, celebrating the imminent launch of the game after ten years in development. It comes just one day before the update (or release) is set to drop, bringing an end to ten years of testing. The highly anticipated release will come hand-in-hand with the exciting feature to <strong>finally </strong>escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Plenty is showcased in the trailer, which, in true Battlestate Games fashion, has the characters dying over, and over, and over again. It’s true to the game, at least.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-1-0-trailer-is-here">Tarkov 1.0 Trailer is Here</h2>



<p>All week, Battlestate Games has been writhing in nostalgia, sharing old trailers and tidbits from Escape from Tarkov’s ten-year development lifecycle. In an epic milestone, the team is finally pushing the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-release-date-start-time/">into a 1.0 state</a>, and it’ll be released worldwide <strong>tomorrow</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the 1.0 trailer for your enjoyment:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov 1.0 Release Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKh9HaTEUfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s an exciting time for fans of the extraction genre. From the launch of Escape from Tarkov to the skyrocketing success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/">ARC Raiders</a>, and from the superstar performance of the satirical <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/">Escape from Duckov</a> to the recent leaks concerning the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/">Far Cry extraction shooter</a>, there’s plenty to be enthused about.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be released tomorrow on Steam, which marks the first time that the extraction shooter has appeared on a platform outside of Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher. It’ll hopefully attract an entirely new audience to the game.</p>







<p>Also, there’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-twitch-drops-campaign-confirmed/">Twitch Drops campaign</a> set to run from this weekend into early December that’ll reward users for watching their favorite streamers play the new update.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-lands-new-paid-dlc-and-free-update-today</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Here are the full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Shortly after launch back in September, Marvelous revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-roadmap-outlined">2025 roadmap</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, and today, we've arrived at another stop on the journey.</p>
<p>The mech action/adventure has today landed its 'Into the Abyss' paid DLC, a story expansion that sees you sent out to explore an all-new map area, Survey Zone: Locus Initi. You can expect to find new enemies, new gear, and a whole new Axiom base to get your head around.</p>
<p>The 'Into the Abyss' DLC is now available to all those with the Digital Deluxe or Super Deluxe versions of the game. Alternatively, you can purchase the expansion separately on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/DLC/Daemon-X-Machina-Titanic-Scion-Into-the-Abyss-2860504.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£13.49 / $14.99</strong>. Do note that you'll need to have made it past Chapter 18 'Investigate the Facility's Depths' in the base game to see any of this bonus content.</p>

<p>But it's not just paid news for Titanic Scion today, since the game has also landed a free update to bump things up to ver. 1.2. There are a bunch of pesky bugs targeted by this one, as outlined in the full patch below (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342490/Daemon_X_Machina_Titanic_Scion/">Steam</a>).</p>
<h2>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Ver. 1.2</h2>

・Weapons that were only available through shops can now be obtained in the field after a certain point.<br>

・Fixed multiple other bugs.</p>
<hr>
<p>We had a perfectly fine time with Titanic Scion when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, but felt that it was let down by its performance issues, which made for a "janky experience in places, with mushy controls and limp feedback". Let's hope that this patch can help move things in the right direction.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/downloads/maxpayne2remixmod-by-darko913">A new Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod</a> introduces path tracing to a few early locations, offering stunning visuals. However, even on high-end GPUs like the RTX 5080, this lighting technology proves to be a true performance killer without proper optimization.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the modded version with path tracing and the vanilla version of the second entry in the series running side by side at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how some locations look stunning with path tracing. </p>



<p>At the same time, the comparison video clearly shows how path tracing is extremely taxing on current gaming hardware: with performance dropping from 1,255 FPS in the vanilla game to just 38 FPS in the mod in some instances, an RTX 5080 with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode takes a hit of over 1,200 FPS, representing an astonishing 97% performance drop overall. It's only with Frame Generation that the modded game reaches playable framerates above 60 FPS.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-path-tracing-requires-optimization-to-be-viable">Path Tracing Requires Optimization to Be Viable</h2>



<p>The massive performance hit seen in the Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod is far from being an uncommon occurrence, as almost every classic game that has received a path tracing overhaul sees similar performance drops. Among them is the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-annihaltes-performance-4080/">original Max Payne</a>, which also sees performance drops in the 1000 FPS range on high-end GPUs, the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">Half-Life remake Black Mesa</a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. </p>



<p>This makes it even clearer how the demanding tech requires optimization work in conjunction with upscaling (and sometimes Frame Generation) to deliver acceptable performance, as demonstrated by some of the best implementations of the tech in recent years, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-continues-impressive-showcase/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rtx-remix-remasters-may-continue-to-be-the-best-option-to-update-classic-games-in-the-future">RTX Remix Remasters May Continue to Be The Best Option to Update Classic Games in the Future</h2>



<p>Although the current RTX Remix mods generally require very powerful hardware to run at playable framerates, these overhauls are likely to continue offering the best remaster option for games that won't receive official updates implementing the latest graphics tech. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Among these is&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto 4,</a>&nbsp;whose eventual remaster is unlikely to receive path tracing support,</span> based on<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"> the remasters released so far by Rockstar Games</a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">.</span></p>



<p>Hopefully, gaming hardware will eventually catch up to make these unofficial remasters playable by the majority of players, even those without access to top-end hardware.</p>

            <p>Remember Brendan from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? If the answer's no, I don't blame you. He's a talking vending machine you can run into and end up going off on a short series of side quests about, but I totally missed him in my fist couple of playthroughs. Anyway, <strong>spoiler alert</strong>, but that quest arc in the base game ends pretty tragically, something a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">modder</a>'s now changed via the addition of an extra bit which lets you pay to have the semi-sentient snack box installed in V's flat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Cyberpunk modder Deceptious is behind this short extra mission, which they've dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25629?tab=description">Brendan's Death Song</a>' in honour of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song I can't admit often makes it into my playlists. I'm more of a basic Californicationy kinda bloke, what can I say?</p>
<p>With this work installed, after running into Brendan the vending machine outside of Megabuilding H8 in Japantown and running through the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/I_Can_See_Clearly_Now">trio of quests</a> involving him, things usually end with him telling a final gag before undergoing a programming change that'll get rid of his chatty quirkiness. Think the ending of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, except Roy Batty's spent his life giving out more free snacks than he should have.</p>
<p>But, what if Harrison Ford could have paid some dudes to pick up Roy Batty, bring him back to life, and install him in the wall of Deckard's flat? Sounds pretty horrifying to be honest, but it's probably a lot less horrifying when this mod does it as a way of letting you keep a bit of Brendan in your cyber-life. Once the machine's been added to the default Megabuilding H10 apartment via a quest heavy on text messages, he'll be available for some brief conversation and occasionally dish out a free drink.</p>
<p>"He goes silent during partner dates in H10, but does have a small change of appearance when the partner is there," Deceptious teases, in case you were worried about being virtually cockblocked by a coin-operated flatmate.</p>
<p>To get the mod up and running, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious' Quest Core</a>, plus standard Cyberpunk advanced tweak enablers <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>. Oh, and a tolerance for groan-worthy gags. Let's face it though, if you saw the headline of this article with my name in the byline and have read this far, you've almost certainly got that. Or you just like hearing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">intriguing Cyberpunk mods</a>.</p>
