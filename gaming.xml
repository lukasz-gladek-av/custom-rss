<p>The digital band consisting of fictional members Noodle, 2D, Murdoc, and Russel — founded by Blur frontman Damon Albarn and <strong>Tank Girl</strong> co-creator Jamie Hewlett — will be making its debut in-game tomorrow, 26th August 2025.</p>

<p>A few gameplay adjustments are also coming when the new season drops tomorrow, such as new "Good" notes and changes to the design of lift notes.

<p>So, Gorillaz, then! A big deal for those of us who grew up in the late '90s and early 2000s. We definitely didn't feel our age when we say that Demon Days was 20 years old...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The last Forza Horizon game, Forza Horizon 5, took drivers to Mexico, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-4-take-weather-with-you/">Forza Horizon 4</a> had them racing around the UK countryside. Playground Games and Microsoft have yet to officially say where Forza Horizon 6 will take players, but a deleted Instagram post, a new report, and Tokyo Game Show 2025 seem to have the answer.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">Forza Horizon 5</a> launched back in 2021, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-forza-horizon-5-continue-support/">despite layoffs in the last month</a>, we're closing in it being high time we heard what's next for the series. A now-deleted Instagram post from car importer Cult and Classic, featuring a Japanese Kei car being photographed for use in the next Forza Horizon game (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-setting-for-the-next-forza-horizon-game-has-seemingly-leaked-via-a-car-company/">VGC</a>), seemingly pointed to Forza Horizon 6 being set in Japan. Especially considering that Kei cars are a model of vehicle that is very rarely found outside of Japan, and is mostly manufactured in Japan.</p>



<p>Now, a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/report-forza-horizon-6-may-be-announced-this-year-in-the-same-place-the-game-is-set">Windows Central</a> adds that there are "<em>official</em>" documents being circulated that confirm the next entry in the Forza Horizon series will be announced at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which is due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-konami-square-enix-and-more-all-confirmed-to-attend-tokyo-game-show-2025/">take place at the end of September</a>. Insider-Gaming's <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339">Tom Henderson</a> and insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1959666173936796128">Nate the Hate</a> both corroborate that they have seen the documents in question, with Nate the Hate adding that he's not seen evidence of a Nintendo Switch 2 version as part of the equation for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can confirm that these documents have been floating around for the last week or so. There's one massively disgruntled employee at Xbox lol <a href="https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom">https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom</a></p>— Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If Forza Horizon 6 is indeed set in Japan, then the Tokyo Game Show makes for the perfect stage on which to unveil the next entry in the series. Even more so when you consider the presence that PlayStation has over Xbox in Japan, and the extreme likelihood, if not surefire conclusion, that the next Forza Horizon game will arrive on PlayStation, if not at launch, then perhaps shortly after, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/">thanks to the success that Forza Horizon 5 has found on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>We'll see what TGS 2025 has in store.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warzone Getting New Resurgence Map Following Black Ops 7 Launch, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-resurgence-black-ops-7-launch-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-getting-new-resurgence-map-following-black-ops-7-launch-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1279968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resurgence may be getting a new map after Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release, one rumor claims. The eagerly anticipated next entry in the Call of Duty franchise has many excited, both for the campaign and multiplayer. However, it looks like Warzone fans may have something to look forward to come its November 14th, 2025 launch. </p>



<p>The Resurgence mode in Warzone has been around since Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War back in 2020. It’s been present in both Warzone 1.0 and Warzone 2.0, as well as at launch for Warzone Mobile. The mode is a different take on the typical Battle Royale mode, with more players and heightened intensity plays. So, the rumored new map is sure to get some back into the Resurgence game.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-to-add-extended-liberty-falls-map-during-season-1-of-black-ops-7-says-credible-leaker">Warzone To Add Extended Liberty Falls Map During Season 1 of Black Ops 7, Says Credible Leaker</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from credible Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1960001313422659979">TheGhostofHope</a>, they state that they have learned a new Resurgence map is in the works. Furthermore, it appears to be an extended version of Liberty Falls. The map, which debuted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a Zombies level, is a rather interesting choice. Still, given TheGhostofHope’s track record, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">Black Ops 7’s release date</a>, there’s a strong chance we may hear about it soon. </p>



<p>Currently, the Multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">slated to happen</a> on September 30th, 2025. As the rumor ties to Season 1 of the upcoming shooter, it’s more than likely we’ll get confirmation there. Until then, fans can get into Resurgence in Warzone and practice before the new map comes along.</p>



<p>What do you think about Liberty Falls being the next Resurgence map in Warzone? Was there one you think deserved it more? Let us know in the comments and on the forums. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/25/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Amongst my many, many silly ideas, becoming a farmer has to rank pretty high amongst them. My long-suffering partner will roll their eyes out of their sockets when I talk about growing crops, herding the sheep in and working outside, not least because I have zero experience in this field. But not anymore! If Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is anything to go by, I’ll be very good at being a farmer, not least because I’m willing to push myself to the point of exhaustion, I’ll work in torrential rain, and because a lot of your time seems to be spent chatting.</p>
<p><iframe title="STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar – Cozy Living Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEr-kUsGhiM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is both thoroughly new, and thoroughly old, standing as a remake of Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar, a Nintendo DS entry in the series from a time before you could pluck controllers off the side of your console. As all Story of Seasons/Harvest Moon games go, you’ve been given a farm, but it’s mostly full of weeds and rocks, rather than anything you would want to eat. It’s then up to you to tidy the place up, fill it with crops, nurture some of the cutest cows and chickens in gaming and, if you’re lucky, find a husband or wife to spend your farming days with.</p>


<p>In and of itself, that’s plenty of fun for the cosy gamer, but there’s still the Grand Bazaar part of the title to deal with. Your farm is part of a small town that’s a little down on its luck, with the blame firmly laid at the entrance of its failing weekly market. Alongside all the work you have to do for your farm and for your prospective love life, you’re also tasked with revitalising the Bazaar, running your own market stall each week, as well as trying to attract new merchants and entrepreneurs to fill out its empty plots.</p>


<p>If that all sounds like a lot, it is. Time runs especially fast in Grand Bazaar, with each day lasting around ten minutes. In that space of time you will find yourself running around town like a sickle-wielding maniac, desperately trying to talk to or greet every potential love interest, nurture your crops, cuddle your pets, milk the cows, groom the alpacas, shear the sheep, go mining, trim the weeds, collect some flowers, hand out gifts, craft items, go fishing, visit the shops, complete some side quests, and a bunch of other things, all while planning out what you have to do in the next day, or week, ready for the impending punctuation point of the weekly market. If you’re like me, that’s a heady and utterly engrossing mix of busy work, but there’s some clear repetition to those tasks that might not fit with other people.</p>
<p>The growth of your town eases some of that repetition, alongside the occasionally enlightening and often pointed conversations with the townsfolk, through to the semi-regular events that crop up, ranging from pet and crop shows to competitive showjumping events. Besides that, the focus of upgrading your tools, or setting yourself to a particular villager request, means that there are times where you have to step away from your usual routine, and these bring enough change to the formula to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>Your level of activity is limited by your stamina bar. Every major action, like tilling the fields, harvesting crops or mining, takes its toll on your body, and like a regular human being you’ll soon become tired. You can alleviate this by eating a meal, or taking a refreshing shower, but you always need to be aware of pushing yourself too far. Story of Seasons is relatively realistic in that sense, with overwork eventually causing you to collapse, or a late night then causing you to oversleep the next day. Broadly, there’s a lot to juggle each day, and the tight time and stamina constraints mean you can’t ever rest too easily.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is horribly addictive, once it’s sunk its crop-clearing sickle into you. I was supposed to play other games this last week, and instead I played Story of Seasons. I was supposed to go out, but instead I played Story of Seasons. Any number of things, including eating, were postponed because I was playing Story of Seasons. I’m not entirely sure it is actually a cosy game, given how far it sinks itself into your psyche and how much of it becomes about doing a job. I think it’s probably more of a farming sim than this year’s Farming Simulator, just with cute graphics, and I have been entirely won over by it.</p>
<p>Visually, it’s not pushing the Switch 2 all that far, but the bright, vibrant art design shines through, and the characters all look and feel like distinct people, aided by the additional artwork that can accompany each conversation. Oddly, you can make the frame rate stutter a tiny bit here and there, generally when you’re using your handy glider to get around, but it doesn’t affect gameplay at all, and one of the joys of the game becomes using the little cut-throughs or jumping across the roofs of houses on your way across town.</p>

<p>The only complaint with Grand Bazaar remains from the original version of the game, which is the annoyances of having three different windmills to craft items in, and having to run between the three of them as you attempt to craft the most lucrative items. Some of that has been lightened by the sprite boxes which let you transport yourself and items around the town, but it does feel like there might still be a better way to ease some of that busy work.</p>

That’s literally the whole point of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, the anime-inspired musical phenomenon that is </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>approaching the top of Netflix’s most-streamed movies of all time</span></a><span>. Its titular trio of demon-slaying songstresses are the latest in a long line of hunters masquerading as a pop act, using the power of their fans’ souls, ignited by their melodies, to push demons back to their hellish prison. A series of limited singalong screenings is both the natural conclusion to its entire thematic foundation, and a correction for the boneheaded business deals that sequestered a truly stunning animated musical to a streaming service.</span></p> <p><span>All that said, I was admittedly pretty underwhelmed with the showing I went to. I dragged my roommate and a visiting friend up from Brooklyn to the Alamo Drafthouse in Lower Manhattan dressed in Huntr/x t-shirts, with my friend having styled her hair to look like rapper Zoey’s signature buns in the film. We’d seen videos of the early screenings at Netflix’s theater in Los Angeles and heard a choir of fans, from adult cosplayers to young children, belting out every song, so we were prepared for a mini-concert to the backdrop of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ stunning visuals. What we got was, well, not that.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620030">© Photo by Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The three of us were in the back row of one of Alamo’s smaller theaters as the host of the event tried her damndest to get the crowd more hyped, and Alamo should give that girl a raise for the work she was putting in. Despite the overwhelmingly adult crowd, the few kids were still the most excited to be there. It was pretty clear based on the adult to kid ratio that most of the crowd had not been dragged there by a child who had probably watched Huntr/x’s literal stan war on loop for the past two months, but even so, a lot of them were not playing into the show. They picked up their swag bag of ramen cups and photo cards of their bias, or favorite member of either Huntr/x or the Saja Boys, but the spirit of a singalong wasn’t flowing through the room. Maybe when the film actually started things would pick up? Nope.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGsevnbItdU"><span>“How It’s Done,”</span></a><span> the opening song in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>,</span> <span>is exactly the song that would tell you if the a singalong audience understood the assignment. The fast-paced, rap-heavy tune is so full of swagger and attitude that anyone who was going to sing should have been singing the second Rumi came in with an exhausted sigh and said “you came at a bad time” while the distorted guitar played underneath her. Our fellow moviegoers, however, did not. As the girls started rapping, my friend and I noticed that we were pretty much the only ones singing above a whisper. Yeah, I belted out “fit check for my napalm era” at the top of my lungs to the ceiling through cupped hands, but it quickly became clear the audience we were with was not passing the vibe check.</span></p> <p><span>To view the situation charitably, it can be hard to get past the established social contract of a movie theater even when you’re told that you’re allowed to be rowdy. Most establishments play a whole video telling you to sit down, shut up, and turn your damn phone off before every movie they play. To Alamo’s credit, they had a video before the show that was like, “Turn the fuck up. Queen out. Power the Honmoon.” Well, if the world had been relying on the crowd in my theater, the demons would have overrun Manhattan by dinner time. Maybe if my friend and I had refused to be silenced by a bunch of quiet curmudgeons, a rising tide would have lifted all ships, but everyone else’s relative silence made it awkward. I’ve been to movie experiences like </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> where the crowd was absolutely losing their shit, and I guess we were just dealt a bad hand this time around.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620031">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At a certain point, my friend and I were mostly just singing along softly in our seats. By the time the bubble-gum sweetness of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=983bBbJx0Mk">“Soda Pop”</a> began and no one was losing their shit about the demon boy band Saja Boys, it became clear to me and my friend that we were the only ones who were really buying into what we paid for, and everyone else was mostly just there to see the movie. This is valid because for most of us, this was the first time any of us had seen the film on the big screen. That’s still a mind-boggling shame.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, even with my lukewarm crowd, seeing the movie in a theater cemented how bonkers it is that Sony was so unsure about the movie–which has now become a cultural phenomenon and whose music has hit </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/lists/huntrx-golden-kpop-demon-hunters-number-1-hot-100/"><span>#1 on the Billboard top 100</span></a><span>–that it partnered with Netflix, who shouldered much of the film’s budget for exclusive rights to distribute it. Sony </span><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1941507/sony-made-netflix-kpop-demon-hunters-earnings/"><span>ensured it would make a profit</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>through the deal, but lost out on what could have been an absolute cash cow for it down the line.</span></p> <p><span>Even after all the hype and the massive viewer numbers, the people behind the movie still seem to be underestimating it. The Alamo Drafthouses in New York City had four total singalong showings, two on Saturday, August 23, and two more on the following Sunday. Those predictably sold out within days, and by the time my group left our underwhelming screening, Alamo Drafthouse had added another half a dozen to the schedule.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span>Because the gremlin in my brain is still singing this movie’s soundtrack, I put my Alamo Drafthouse membership to good use and decided to use it to go see the movie again the following day for no additional cost. Worst case scenario, I get to see a movie I really love on the big screen again. Best case scenario, I find a crowd that will match my freak. I picked a showing with more seats, thus statistically more likely to have sickos, but while it was marginally better, I still felt like most of the audience wasn’t buying in, and I didn’t even have my friend with me this time as a buffer. I still yelled “fit check for my napalm era” and sang to myself in my seat, but with the exception of one young diva who not only sang every song but recited every line, it felt like the singalong event was mostly just another chance to see a movie the way it should have been seen in the first place. It’s a shame that I scroll through my feeds and see videos of the most hype crowds singing along at screenings elsewhere and get FOMO for an event I was literally in attendance for, but at least I got the transcendent experience of hearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug_pv5-r1js">“What It Sounds Like”</a> booming through the Drafthouse’s sound system.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620029">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There was a guy sitting next to me at the second showing who told his friends he’d only seen the first half of the movie in passing, so he braved a singalong event to see the movie for the first time on the big screen. As much as I enjoyed watching </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>on my laptop, I’m always going to envy his experience of seeing it for the first time in that environment. There’s an entire subplot in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>about Rumi, the half human/half demon lead singer, being told by her caretaker Celine that she must cover up her demonic patterns and hide who she is from the world, and even her best friends. No one could possibly understand, Celine says, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. That same unsure reservation is why </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ victory lap of finally getting to be on the big screen is happening months after it’s already etched itself on our culture as much more than a limited-time event. Much like Celine herself, maybe some people at Sony should have had more faith in what they were making. And maybe by the time the eventual sequel comes out, New York City’s moviegoers will step the fuck up and sing along next time.</span></p>

<p>"Even PlayStation was never this in touch with the fan base"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Party Jamboree + Shawn Layden" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf55cf7fa7ae1/mario-party-jamboree-plus-shawn-layden.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shawn Layden, formerly the President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and Executive Vice President and COO of Sony Network Entertainment International, has come out in praise of Nintendo for being the most in-touch with its fan base.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD0gJdspbqo&amp;ab_channel=HipHopGamer">HipHopGamer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/former-playstation-boss-says-no-one-is-in-touch-with-their-fan-base-more-than-nintendo-and-even-sony-was-never-this-in-touch-with-what-players-wanted/">GamesRadar+</a>), Layden says that the reason Nintendo hasn't suffered from the same amount of slowdown as other publishers post-Covid is because the company has "been very intentional in what lane they play in," by specifically focusing on "who their fans are and what their fans want."</p>
<p>Layden believes that "No one is more in touch with their fan base than Nintendo. Even PlayStation was never this in touch with the fan base as Nintendo is" and that as gaming sales and revenues climbed during the pandemic, other publishers decided to chase the "curve" by hiring more people.</p>
<p>When lockdown restrictions ended, however, Layden says that Nintendo anticipated the drop-off: "They stayed on course. They had their plan. They're moving their plan. So they didn’t have to suffer the peaks and valleys so much as if you're chasing the opportunity."</p>
<p>"They just know what their opportunity is. They see it. They understand it better than anyone else. And they go for it and they do it really well." You can watch the full interview below.</p>

<p>Of course, whether you agree with Layden's opinion is another thing, but the Switch 2 is delivering early days with multiple genres and returning icons. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> is due to launch this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> saw DK return in his first-grand new game in over a decade, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is a surprise sequel to a GameCube favourite, so we'll see whether this continues into the new console's life.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you think Nintendo understands its fan base in the comments.</em></p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>From a gamer's perspective, there's no need for the PlayStation 6 or Xbox next-generation system, according to Final Fantasy XIV's director Naoki Yoshida.</p>



<p>Asked about the next generation of consoles and the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV launching on them in a fresh interview posted on <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm">Feed4Gamer</a>, Yoshi-P confirmed there's always the possibility of the game launching on new platforms, as his aim is to make the game accessible to as many players as possible. With recent platforms coming with very high specs, the team's work is considerably easier than in the past, so any new hardware release is definitely a positive in this regard. From a gamer's perspective, however, there's no need of the PlayStation 6 and the Xbox next-generation system, Yoshi-P added. Right now, the Final Fantasy XIV director feels that people are happy with the current-generation systems, highlighting how the price of new hardware likely plays a factor in this sentiment.</p>



<p>Besides talking about the PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox, Naoki Yoshida also touched upon PlayStation 4 support for Final Fantasy XIV, which will continue for as long as possible, although there will inevitably come a time when support for the previous generation system will be dropped, mostly due to the console's OS and hardware regulations that limit data, which are already making plenty of games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">Genshin Impact</a> drop support for previous generation hardware. So far, Sony Interactive Entertainment has increased these limits for Final Fantasy XIV as per the team's requests, but they have already informed the developers that they are reaching their limits from their side, so the end of support for the PlayStation 4 version of the popular MMORPG may be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Although many may not feel the need for the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox, as Naoki Yoshida highlighted, there's no denying that the next console generation promises to be one of the most interesting in decades, as both Sony and Microsoft seem to be heading into different directions. While Microsoft seems to be going for a modular design offering<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/"> flexibility that will compete more with pre-built gaming PCs</a>, Sony will reportedly release a home console delivering up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">10 times the ray tracing performance of the base PlayStation 5</a> and a handheld capable of running current generation games natively.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV Might Not Be On PS4 Forever, Yoshi-P Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-yoshi-p-comments</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-might-not-be-on-ps4-forever-yoshi-p-says.1279911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Yoshi-P has declared that while he wants to keep supporting the MMORPG on PS4 for "as long as possible", technical limitations might mean the game drops support for the platform eventually.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an interview</a> with Feed4Gamers, Yoshi-P says that his "basic stance" is to continue supporting hardware "which has grown old", but that Sony's "hardware regulations" might make it difficult for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>to remain on the last-gen console.</p>

<p>According to Yoshi-P, the game's continuous updates mean that Square Enix has been asking Sony to increase its data limits for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>specifically, and while Sony has been happy to oblige, the company has told Yoshi-P and his team that "they are also reaching their limits", he says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-support-yoshi-p-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=GgiuZSw0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-support-yoshi-p-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=0jiJpx0z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>might not be on PS4 for much longer.</figcaption></figure><p>Yoshi-P says that his goal is to keep&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>on as many platforms as possible for as long as he can, but that eventually, last-gen hardware will reach "its limits in terms of its technology".</p>

<p>However, when that time comes, Yoshi-P promises that he will "provide clear reasoning for that decision", so if and when PS4 support does end for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you'll know about it.</p>

<p>This discussion comes after a couple of prominent games recently ended support for the PS4; earlier this month, HoYoverse declared that PS4 support for gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">will end next year</a>, and&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">subsequently followed suit</a> for its battle royale shooter.</p>

<p>In both cases, the studios said they wanted to focus on current-gen hardware for their games, and that's something for which Yoshi-P seems grateful too; in the aforementioned interview, he says current-gen hardware is "quite high spec" and that working with it is "easier...compared to back in the days".</p>




<p>This interview comes shortly after the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.3</a> for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, which brought a brand new story dungeon, the second part of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, and more earlier this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>developer Sad Cat Studios has revealed that work on the game is still very much underway, and that it's now due to launch sometime in spring next year.</p>

<p>In a new development update, project lead Yura Zhdanovich acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>&nbsp;has "seen a couple of delays", but he says that he and his team have always "been trying to do what's best for the project".</p>

<p>Zhdanovich says that he and Sad Cat Studios are "really close to finishing production" on&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, and that the next phase is "intense testing and polishing of the game", although he doesn't say exactly how long he expects that phase to take.</p>

He says the team's goal was to make the game with "no shortcuts", and so everything has been made "in a classic way", with "handcrafted pixel art".</p>

<p>The rest of the trailer delves into&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>'s animation and development processes. It's worth a look if you're interested in the story behind the game, and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4&amp;ab_channel=IGN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> courtesy of IGN.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, it's an upcoming action platformer that blends chunky 2.5D-style pixel art with gameplay that "combines cinematic platforming...and free-flow action combat".</p>

<p>Set in an alternative 1980s,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>casts you as an artificial intelligence known as R.E.A.C.H., who's trapped inside a human body. You'll have to adjust to life as a human, all while discovering that "everything comes at a price", according to Sad Cat.</p>




<p>When it does finally arrive,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on Xbox Series X|S, and it'll be a day one Game Pass title as well. A specific release date will be announced later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toxic Commando HANDS-ON PREVIEW – The Co-Op Shooter That I Wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/toxic-commando-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toxic-commando-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-the-co-op-shooter-that-i-wanted.1279905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were invited by Focus Entertainment to try out John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, a cooperative shooter developed by Saber Interactive.</p>



<p>And if you’ve somehow never heard of John Carpenter—maybe you’ve been living under a rock—he’s one of the most legendary names in horror cinema, responsible for classics like Halloween, The Fog, and The Thing. His influence is all over Toxic Commando, especially in the group banter and cinematic cutscenes throughout the missions.</p>



<p>The story pays homage to 1980s horror films, which should resonate strongly with fans of titles like Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor. In the game, a scientific experiment goes horribly wrong, unleashing the Sludge God upon Earth. This monstrous entity begins a process of terraforming, threatening all life on the planet.</p>



<p>To clean up the mess, the scientist enlists the help of the Toxic Commandos—battle-hardened mercenaries tasked with stopping the apocalypse.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Official Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eknbu0SKGzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-toxic-commando-is-surprisingly-satisfying">Toxic Commando Is Surprisingly Satisfying</h2>



<p>During my play session, I teamed up with three other members of the press, and we communicated entirely through the in-game voice chat. To my surprise, the chat worked flawlessly—clear audio, no dropouts, and smooth coordination.</p>



<p>In games like this, communication is everything, and having a reliable voice system is a huge win. Our mission dropped us into an open map with the objective of clearing out specific zones. Each Commando has a unique class, and while we couldn’t choose our roles during the demo, one teammate deployed a protective dome, while my character generated a healing aura—each ability felt distinct and useful.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s experience with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is immediately noticeable. At several points, we were swarmed by massive waves of zombies, all powered by Saber’s impressive Swarm Engine. In Toxic Commando, you’ll even be able to use vehicles for traversal and crowd control, adding a layer of mobility and chaos to the action.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gunplay is another highlight. Weapons feel punchy and responsive, and enemies aren’t bullet sponges—a common pitfall in co-op shooters. The open map design also encourages optional exploration, which becomes essential for survival. With ammo running low and hordes closing in, scavenging becomes a strategic necessity.</p>



<p>Speaking of hordes, enemy variety is solid, mixing standard grunts with elite threats that require more coordination to take down.</p>



<p>The climax of our mission involved defending a structure from three massive waves of zombies. With over 200 enemies on screen and multiple points under attack, tension ran high. Thankfully, we managed to coordinate our class abilities and pull through.</p>



<h2 id="h-progression-amp-monetization">Progression &amp; Monetization</h2>



<p>Since the demo focused solely on gameplay, I didn’t get to explore the progression systems. However, a Focus Entertainment representative told me that players will be able to upgrade both their classes and weapons. More details on that will be revealed later.</p>



<p>As for monetization, information was limited. The current plan isn’t to push players into spending real money on cosmetics or similar items. It’s likely Saber Interactive will follow a model similar to Space Marine 2, with a battle pass offering cosmetic rewards.</p>



<p>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando is set to launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series, with full crossplay support across all platforms. Based on my experience, it checks all the boxes I look for in a co-op shooter—and I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on it.</p>



<p>If you’ve been missing the chaotic fun of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> or <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, this one should be on your radar too.</p>

<p>In the announcement (translated by Google), Nintendo stated that fans will be able to "enjoy a more convenient and enriched gaming experience" and that "specific service content will be announced separately in the near future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mnyspt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's yet another step in Nintendo's expansion into the Taiwanese market. The Big N opened up a new subsidiary, Nintendo of Taiwan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">in February 2025</a>, and the company has been running operations since 1st April this year.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Nintendo even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justdan.taiwan/posts/pfbid033YL9t1A1e6gsMwS6wRSDRVhH8MAtdUMhpTpe2HphWwsZhUN5p36jBgXVYhf7gam4l">opened a Flagship Store</a> in the Xinyi district in Taipei in April, too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What has Sony learned from its biggest gaming blunder one year later? Why is Ubisoft’s CEO headed to court five years after a sexual harassment scandal rocked the company? And how many more copies will <em>Hollow Knight</em> sell as everyone rushes to play it ahead of <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch next month? Welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take cover. The end-of-year game release onslaught is about to begin.</p> <h2>Sony is taking steps to avoid another<em> Concord</em></h2> <p>How did Sony slow-walk its way into a live service debacle that <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">cost it over $200 million</a>? A year after <em>Concord</em> launched, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst explained what the company is doing to avoid releasing another expensive game that no one wants to play. &nbsp;“I don’t want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply,” he <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>. He promised more info sharing between studios and executives and said, “We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways. The advantage of every failure is that people now understand how necessary that [testing] is.”</p> <p>What about Sony’s live-service plans moving forward? Hulst didn’t say the company is backing off its online multiplayer push, but he did hand-wave away prior commitments to launch nearly a dozen live-service projects by 2026. “The number is not so important,” he said. “What is important to me is having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities.”<em> FairGame$</em>, expected to be the next multiplayer game in Sony’s pipeline, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961">recently lost its studio head after a bad internal review</a>.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft’s CEO has been summoned to appear in court</h2> <p>The French publisher <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/affaire-de-harcelement-chez-ubisoft-le-pdg-yves-guillemot-convoque-devant-la-justice_AN-202508220570.html">faces a fresh lawsuit</a> from the same victims who recently testified against former senior members of the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-metoo-reckoning-two-months-later-1844717203">over sexual harassment allegations</a>, including ex-chief creative officer Serge Hascoët. “This new case is being brought by the same plaintiffs, a union and four people, and is based on the same facts at those for which three former employees were tried and convicted this past June, following an investigation by the public prosecutor’s office,” Ubisoft executive vice president Cécile Russeil wrote in an email to staff on August 22.</p> <p>CEO Yves Guillemot was subpoenaed to testify on October 1, though it’s unclear if the new litigation will be able to compel any new information to surface about the company’s workplace culture reckoning five years ago. “Ubisoft will continue to cooperate with the justice system in this matter, as it has done over the past five years in the review of the facts related to this case,” Russeil <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-summoned-to-appear-before-french-court-in-relation-to-harassment-trial/">told <em>VGC</em></a> in a statement. Guillemot’s son was <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-charlie-yves-guillemot-tencent-far-cry-7-1851786421">recently made co-CEO</a> of a new business group within Ubisoft that oversees its most profitable franchises, including<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Far Cry</em>.</p> <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> is getting free DLC</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year!</p> <p>📖 New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th century AlUla<br>🎮 Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location<br>🎁 All for free</p> <p>Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/8CjB3MRvfR">pic.twitter.com/8CjB3MRvfR</a></p> <p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The 2023 game has new content coming on the horizon. It takes place in AlUla, Saudi Arabia. The new story update will arrive before the end of 2025 and comes <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">after a report</a> that Ubisoft received funding from the Saudi government-backed Public Investment Fund, which has recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-scopely-niantic-saudi-arabia-monster-hunter-1851769360">been flooding the games industry with cash</a>.</p>

 <h2>Switch 2 games with only game key cards won’t be eligible for preservation in Japan’s National Diet Library</h2> <p>The archival body will only take “physical media that contains the content itself,” according to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/48598">a new report from <em>Famitsu</em></a>, <a href="http://only physical media that contains the content itself” is considered eligible for preservation. “Since a key card, on its own, does not qualify as content, it falls outside of our scope for collection and preservation.”">translated by <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Since a key card, on its own, does not qualify as content, it falls outside of our scope for collection and preservation,” a representative of the library said. While all first-party Nintendo games are contained on the physical Switch 2 carts, most third-party releases have opted for the game key card solution, meaning most will no longer be accessible if and when the servers eventually shut down sometime in the future.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima wrote a concept for <em>Death Stranding 3</em> but doesn’t want to make it</h2> <p>The longtime director told <a href="https://t.co/69Pwg1OTCO">PlayStation Arabia</a> that<em> Death Stranding 2</em> was his finale for the series, but that he has already scripted what a sequel might be about. “So I have that in data,” he said, according to a translation <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1959427581536842060">by Genki</a>. “I hope that someone will create it for me.”</p>

 <h2><em>Peak</em> is finally Steam Deck verified</h2> <p>The summer Steam hit, which has already sold over 10 million copies, received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">a new update</a> that fixes some bugs and gets the game working on Valve’s handheld. Unfortunately for speedrunners, however, a major game-breaking trick no longer works. “Made fog walls taller so you can’t shoot over them to win the game in a minute with the Scout Cannon exploit,” read the patch notes.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight</em> is skyrocketing up the Steam charts</h2> <p><em>Silksong</em> is out in less than two weeks, and everyone who never finished<em> Hollow Knight</em> is busy catching up. The game currently <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/367520#All">has over 35,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam, nearly double its April 2022 peak. Not bad for an eight-year-old game that’s already sold over 15 million copies. If the sequel sells another 15 million, it will officially be <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1959689523048378409">a bigger franchise than <em>Metroid</em></a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/snake-eater-delta-remake-mgsv-5-comparison-vs-2000619209">How<em> Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake plays compared to <em>Metal Gear Solid 5</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530"><em>Pokémon</em>‘s new horror teasers are the perfect nightmare fuel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bubsy-4d-new-sequel-gameplay-review-hands-on-preview-gamescom-2000619555">The new <em>Bubsy</em> game actually looks kinda rad?</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Silksong's 2019 vs 2025 Demo: All Changes + New Details I Found" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWVJQa4wx6Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Borderlands 4 is one of the biggest launches taking place before the end of 2025, and part of modern gaming means some players are probably wondering whether it will be included on Xbox Game Pass. We have the details.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Borderlands 4 will have more than enough to whet the appetite with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 billion guns</a>, and we were impressed with the title after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to secure a copy of Borderlands 4 and are wondering if you can avoid splashing out due to a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Borderlands 4 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Borderlands 4 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 12th</strong>.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would result in automatic inclusion in the service, and there has not been any announcement of it joining the catalog.</p>



<p>Though Microsoft has not announced the first wave of titles coming to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September, any announcement for Borderlands 4’s inclusion would have likely been made well in advance, as it would have been a huge coup.</p>

<p><strong>Borderlands 4 is likely to come to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although any inclusion is likely to be a long way away.</strong></p>



<p>Gearbox has a history of releasing titles on Game Pass, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 3 leaving the service</a> on August 31 ahead of the launch of the new title. Borderlands 3, including all of the DLC for the title, joined the Game Pass catalog in April, resulting in a four-month stint on the service.</p>



<p>That shows that Gearbox is more than happy to embrace the platform, though it’s likely the inclusion period was decided upon to raise interest in Borderlands 4. Therefore, it would be surprising if the new title were to join the service anytime soon.</p>



<p>Given Borderlands 3 was first released in 2019, it took six years for the title to join Game Pass earlier this year. As such, don’t expect Borderlands 4 to feature for a long time, potentially not until post-2030, especially with plenty of DLC planned for the future.</p>



<p>Have you secured your pre-order of Borderlands 4? Let us know in the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Saturday, NYC Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani announced that his campaign would hold a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx3cikladk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scavenger hunt</a> across the city the next day. The themed event would be entirely accessible by public transit (one of his campaign issues), and there would be a surprise at the end. The number of people who showed up, and some of the design of the hunt itself, made for some wobbles, but it was a clever way to explore the city and hang out with friends, and the latest manifestation of Mamdani’s “what if it were nice to live in New York?” platform.</p><p>Mamdani announced the first clue in a social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx5r3ivmzk2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> at 11am on Sunday. It referenced New York City’s youngest mayor and told participants to go to “the Gilded Age hall where that mayor spent a lot of his time.” It wasn’t too hard to figure out this one meant Tammany Hall off Union Square, though I’m committed enough to pedantry to note that Tammany Hall would have had a different headquarters nearby during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_J._Grant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugh J. Grant</a>’s time as mayor. But given that the <a href="https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2490.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official landmark</a> for Tammany Hall is its last HQ, and that Union Square is the de facto meeting point for numerous political gatherings in NYC, that’s where I headed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After a morning filled with personal shame wherein I tried to adjust my bike brakes, hopelessly fucked it up somehow, and had to go to my local bikeshop to get them fixed, I arrived at Union Square just before the 2pm start time. I was shocked to find multiple lines for the scavenger hunt’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx6344khtk22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticker card</a> consuming the square, one continuing down 17th St and another following Union Square West to end at 15th. While I waited, I overheard multiple curious onlookers ask what the line was for. Many participants explained that they’d seen Mamdani’s announcement on Instagram and TikTok; I’d seen it on Bluesky, and these different platforms coupled with a huge turnout, with people lining up <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karenho.bsky.social/post/3lx737hoxfc2j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well before</a> the event even started, felt like proof that Mamdani’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> focus is continuing to reach people and bring them out to his events. Nevertheless, one passerby said “Who the hell is that?” when someone explained it was an event for Zohran Mamdani, though I’m not clear whether they were local or from out of town.&nbsp;</p><p>I was excited to discover that <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games journalist</a> and Aftermath <a href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-line" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">line-waiting pal</a> Autumn Wright was in another line. We met up in time for the less-exciting discovery that the Mamdani campaign had already run out of the sticker cards, but we didn’t think much of it since we could still follow the clues.&nbsp;</p><p>I had worried that bringing my bike was a bad idea, presuming Mamdani’s emphasis on public transit would mean the hunt would take place across the boroughs and I’d end up either biking to Queens or dragging my bike on trains all day. My fears seemed confirmed when we got the second clue, held up on a poster by a campaign volunteer: “‘He was fresh and everyone else was tired’--whether from running against him or running on this track named after him, who’s to say.” At first, we thought the clue was leading us to a traffic circle in the Bronx, but a nudge from another participant and Autumn looking up the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/nyregion/metrocampaigns/a-campaign-to-remember-the-mixed-legacy-of-john-v.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote</a> pointed us instead to a running track named after Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John V. Lindsay</a> in East River Park, a far less onerous trek.</p><p>Of course, every other person in the park was headed to the same place. There was a rush for the nearby <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-definitive-citi-bike-strategy-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CitiBike</a> dock and for a bus stop on 14th St, and I was glad I’d decided to bring my bike. Autumn and their partner snagged CitiBikes, and we made our way through Alphabet City to the park. Getting to the track by public transit was apparently far less easy; my friend Jeanne Thornton, a narrative designer and author of the video-game themed novel <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/743703/asl-by-jeanne-thornton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>A/S/L</em></a>, told me there was a “bottleneck on the first clue [due to] heavy dependence on the M14 bus, which straight up refused to pick anyone up because too many Zohran people.” While many of the clues would ultimately be accessible by subway, several of the early-game ones were best done by bus, and it’s no surprise lower Manhattan’s bus system wasn’t prepared to deal with the number of people it seems like even the Mamdani campaign <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx67rosykk2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t expecting</a>. <strong>(Update, 8/25/25, 11:40am-- </strong>The Mamdani campaign posted that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNxzgNv3MCE/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 4000 people </a>took part.<strong>)</strong></p><p>When we got to the track, there was another crush of people waiting for the pedestrian overpass, but things were pretty <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxxanishi.bsky.social/post/3lx6aaknohk2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orderly</a> despite the crowd. We got our next clue: “We disagree with this former mayor on most things, but we’re happy to be in the same boat with him on free public transit. Meet us outside this Manhattan terminal where you’ll find the City’s shining example of free transit.”</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>It was easy to figure out that this one was the Staten Island Ferry terminal near Whitehall Street, and I actually didn’t even register the “mayor” part of this clue until writing this article. (It’s a reference to Guiliani, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/29/nyregion/mayor-to-end-50-cent-fare-on-si-ferry.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the ferry free</a> in 1997.) Our bike ride to the terminal was frustrating due to huge swathes of the East River Greenway being under construction, though this did inspire us to lead a gaggle of struggling CitiBikers in taking over the car lane on South Street. Once the greenway opened up, we got a great view of the water, and I was excited to cheer like a <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerd</a> as we passed the <a href="https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/the-fleet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic ships</a> at the South Street Seaport.</p><p>At Whitehall, we got our next clue: “I am a member of NYC-DSA, but I would not be the first member to be elected mayor. Find your next clue at the building named after the man who was. You’ll be doing us a really big favor.” I got this one totally wrong by presuming DSA was a recent development and instead looking up socialist mayors, which sent me down an informative dead end about Schenectady mayor <a href="https://time.com/7301483/socialist-mayor-before-zohran-mamdani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">George Lund</a>. Autumn again came in clutch by just looking up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Socialists_of_America_public_officeholders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DSA officeholders</a> and revealing the very-new-to-me fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dinkins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Dinkins</a> was a member. (“Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?/You'll be doing us a really big favor” is a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidlublin.bsky.social/post/3lx6oa7lykk2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote</a> from an A Tribe Called Quest song.)&nbsp;</p><p>The next location, the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dcas/business/dcasmanagedbuildings/david-n-dinkins-manhattan-municipal-building.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building</a> near City Hall, was back to the east side and not terribly far, but we were definitely starting to feel the wear of zigzagging across town with CitiBikes. Jeanne also highlighted the routing to me as a problem, telling me she felt there was “too much backtracking.” Luckily, the ferry terminal to City Hall is a pretty straightforward trip by train. A cyclist I’d met back in Union Square had told me he’d brought his bike because he was worried all the transit trips would get expensive, and by stop three I could definitely imagine them adding up.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>Around this time we learned via rumblings that Mamdani had said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:j5hrotody26iqi24hcusufxu/post/3lx67rosykk2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that “only people with clue cards will be able to access the final stop.” That information, combined with the slog of CitiBikes, helped Autumn and their partner decide to take a break while they pondered whether to continue. I felt committed to seeing the whole thing through, so I biked up to the Dinkins building on my own. Without other people to keep me honest, I made my standard mistake of biking by vibes instead of actual directions, then got further lost at the Dinkins building by confusing it with places I’d done jail and court support. I got to the clue only a few minutes before Autumn and their partner showed up: “Eric Adams isn’t the first scandal-ridden guy to fancy himself a ‘night life mayor.’ Find your next clue in the park named for the mayor who led this city as it was roaring, before it all came crashing down.”</p><p>This one was fun to dig into, and I quickly got the answer of mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James J. Walker</a>. Autumn and their partner decided to bail, and I had a lovely ride up a mostly empty Hudson Street to <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/james-j-walker-park" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James J. Walker Park</a>. (Thanks, <a href="https://congestionreliefzone.mta.info/tolling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congestion pricing</a>!) I was utterly hopeless at the next clue: “I often quote this former mayor who said ‘If you agree with me on 9 out of 12 issues, vote for me.’ If you rearrange 12 out of 12 letters of this location adjacent to a bridge named for him, you get A RAP MAY WALTZ (and yes, see a psychiatrist.)” I figured out the mayor, Ed Koch, and the subsequent bridge, the Queensboro, pretty quickly, but I had absolutely no idea what to do next. I asked some people nearby, and as we discussed the tram to Roosevelt Island I thought we were figuring the clue out together before I realized they were just walking me to the answer of <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tramway-plaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tramway Plaza</a>. They were clearly disappointed in me, and my guilt over not putting in my best effort pursued me on the lengthy bike ride up to 2nd Ave and 59th St.</p><p>I took 8th Ave most of the way since it has a bike lane, and as my legs started to feel all the miles of riding I’d done, I thought about how much of the city I’d seen that I otherwise wouldn’t have. I’d passed by places I’d hung out in college and places I’d enjoyed running when I was training for the NYC marathon, revisiting memories that feel deeply tied to living in the city by being out in it. At an intersection, an older man complimented me on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv8VA5IOOib/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vintage bike</a> and told me his own was 40 years old, and we chatted about bikes as we waited for the light. (He also told me he would never ride on tires as skinny as my 20 inchers, a sentiment I definitely agree with.) It was one of those random, lovely encounters you’d only have by moving around, being out among the city’s people instead of holed up at home. As Republicans (and Democrats like Mamdani primary opponent <a href="https://www.andrewcuomo.com/press/cuomo-unveils-subway-safety-plan-restore-order-and-confidence-nycs-transit-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Cuomo</a>) scare-monger the dangers of the city and its <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/the-subway-is-not-scary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transit</a>, there was definitely power in telling a different story through getting participants outside, encouraging them to interact with each other and use the city’s streets, busses, and trains.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>At Tramway Plaza, a campaign volunteer reminded me that only people with sticker cards could go to the final location, telling me the requirement was due to capacity issues, and declined to show me the last clue. People who didn’t have cards definitely seemed disappointed, though most still seemed in good spirits about it. Jeanne, who’d ended her participation at Walker Park, told me she was disappointed that “you are dead in the water if you didn’t have a card–two women we’re talking to at the park are saying there should be an alternate final clue for like, a runner up party… Basically there’s no credits roll for anyone other than the lucky 1000 who got cards.” Even though I’d enjoyed the ride to my final stop, it <em>was</em> a long way to go just to arrive at an anti-climactic ending, especially since the result had nothing to do with my actual performance during the scavenger hunt.</p><p>I spoke with some volunteers, who told me they hadn’t known much about the scavenger hunt beforehand and had just been in general campaign chats when it needed staffing. One had been canvassing for Mamdani just before their shift at the hunt, while for another it was their first time volunteering with the campaign. Some participants took pity on me and showed me a picture of the final clue on their phone: “One of my favorite cafes shares a nickname of my favorite mayor [cut off in photo] time. And don’t worry, they always remember to bloom their coffee. Travel to another borough to this cafe to end the hunt!”</p><p>The folks who shared the photo told me the answer– Little Flower Cafe in Astoria, a nickname for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorello_La_Guardia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiorello La Guardia</a> and a reference to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> Mamdani did with The New York Times. It wouldn’t have been a bad bike ride over the Queensboro to do my journalistic duty of checking it out, but the dread of tacking more miles on to my commute home and discomfort with the idea of hanging out outside something that seemed to already be struggling with capacity dissuaded me, and I biked back to Brooklyn instead. People who had cards apparently, after waiting in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jjlee.bsky.social/post/3lx6pyoxlss2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another line</a>, got <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeremywilcox.bsky.social/post/3lx6ktgi7jc24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a photo with Mamdani and a free drink</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at all the clues and answers, the scavenger hunt’s theme seems to be mayoral corruption, something I already suspected given that Mamdani’s announcement video featured a bag of the brand of chips into which an Eric Adams advisor <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/08/20/winnie-greco-eric-adams-aide-attempted-cash-katie-honan-reporter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuffed an envelope of cash and tried to pass it off to a The City reporter last week</a>. Adams, by the way, is not impressed with the scavenger hunt, <a href="https://x.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1959294873166598282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> from his personal account that “This run around is exactly what he plans to do with your safety, your housing and your taxes. It’s all kid’s play for Mamdani” and that Mamdani <a href="https://x.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1959767315375071618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants to</a> “turn our city into the Squid Games.” Cuomo, for his part, <a href="https://x.com/andrewcuomo/status/1959312164826607688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> “defund the police but great scavenger hunts,” <a href="https://x.com/andrewcuomo/status/1959312736942223514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed</a>, bafflingly, by “no class free pizza for all seniors.”</p><p>I’m no political strategist, so I certainly can’t say if the scavenger hunt was successful as a campaign event. No one asked me for my contact information or said much about Mamdani’s policies, though it’s likely most people learned about the event from Mamdani’s social media and thus don’t need much education. I definitely learned more about NYC mayors and their scandals or combatting of scandals than I knew before. It’s not hard to draw a line from the theme to the scandals that plagued <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3gz35dgro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adams</a> and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/03/andrew-cuomo-nyc-mayor-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuomo’s</a> administrations, and to read that in contrast to Mamdani subtly casting himself as a more honest alternative. And while I’m sure the whole thing wasn’t intended to piss off Cuomo and Adams, seeing them both act like babies about it made them look out-of-touch and no fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Being fun is no guarantee that you’ll make a good mayor, but Mamdani’s campaign has embraced what seems like a genuine joy and love of what the city has to offer. Several of his campaign events have involved stunts out on the streets, walking the <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/zohran-mamdani-goes-the-distance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">length of Manhattan</a> or <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/morning-spew-zohran-mamdani-takes-a-hike-faster-than-the-m34/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racing a slow bus</a>; these kinds of things get Mamdani’s name and face out there while also portraying him as someone who actually <em>likes</em> being here. While the final stop of the hunt might have been a closed event, the hunt itself and many of his other activities have felt like reminders that there are still things to do in the city that don’t require entrance fees and private property, with the scavenger hunt pushing participants to gather in the free public spaces of our parks and plazas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a game–if a scavenger hunt can be called a game–the need to Google some of the deeper-cut clues (Autumn overheard one participant in Union Square saying they’d used Chat-GPT to get the Tammany Hall answer) wasn’t always the most fun way to puzzle something out, though hardcore NYC history nerds might have been better at solving things on their own. Not being able to get to the end despite solving all the clues in time because I hadn’t arrived long before the event even started was also a bit of a bummer, and I can imagine feeling that letdown more strongly if I’d been spending money on travel fare or dealing with Sunday train schedules to take part. In that regard, the routing could have been more efficient; Jeanne drew me what she called an “angry map” of her experience on transit, which stood in contrast to my bike route:</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But for me, it was a nice way to be outside and see friends, to learn some things about the city while reconnecting with the pleasures of just exploring it. A scavenger hunt doesn’t say much about how Mamdani would lead the city, but it did bring his supporters together to have a good time with each other and get his name out there to onlookers. That the turnout was so big for something with little warning, at a time when the city is <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/08/07/city-less-crowded-summer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traditionally empty</a>, is another reminder of the popularity of his campaign. We’ll see how that momentum carries through to November’s mayoral election.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Update]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-scavenger-hunt]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2-5d-pixel-art-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-will-launch-in-spring-2026.1279851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Replaced, the 2.5D pixel-art, retro-futuristic, cyberpunk-themed platformer that was first announced in 2021, has a new release window from developer Sad Cat Studios, with game director Yura Zhdanovich announcing, "<em>with confidence</em>," that Replaced will arrive on PC and Xbox Series X/S in Spring 2026.</p>



<p>When Replaced was revealed in 2021, it was one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-140-third-party-studios/">enticing games coming to Xbox</a>, and players were keen to get their hands on it in 2022, when it was initially due to launch. It wasn't Zhdanovich's or the rest of Sad Cat Studios' plan to have Replaced go five years between its official announcement and release, but neither could have predicted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, and the impact it would have on the Belarus-based development team.</p>



<p>If not for the invasion, Replaced would have likely been released years ago. But the invasion, coupled with the regular complications and struggles of developing a game, pushed its launch back to 2026. In today's development update from the studio (published through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4">IGN</a>), with Zhdanovich narrating, he went through a bit of the journey the game has been on, and showed how it has improved from its prototyping phase to now.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play&nbsp;</em><em>REPLACED&nbsp;</em>and it’s no secret that it’s taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologise for that," Zhdanovich added in a press release. "<em>We’ve always been trying to do what’s right for the project, which in turn, means delivering to you a truly special experience. The good news is that we now are very close to finishing production and&nbsp;</em><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>will be coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S in Spring 2026."</p>



<p>For now, we have a release window to look forward to. Later this year, Zhdanovich confirmed that the studio will debut the final trailer for the game, at which point we'll also learn the specific release date.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-raising-the-level-cap/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-go-level-cap-being-massively-raised-for-the-first-time-in-five-years.1279848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Avid Pokémon GO players have been desperate for the level cap to be raised for ages. Niantic has sounded the klaxon and is finally making it happen. An October 2025 update will see Pokémon GO’s level cap receive a huge increase.</p>



<p>It’s hard to remember a time when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-water-festival-2025-all-spawns-timed-research-collection-challenges-raids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> level cap wasn’t 50. This is because the level cap has remained this way since it was increased in November 2020—just under five years ago. We moved from 40 to 50, and it’s stayed like this. Not for long, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go-level-cap-will-be-80-from-october-15">Pokémon GO Level Cap Will be 80 From October 15</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A seismic leap. Credit to Niantic</figcaption></figure>



<p>The shocking announcement came from the Pokémon GO X account on August 25: “This October, we’re increasing the level cap from 50 to 80, while rebalancing the overall leveling up journey.”</p>



<p>Closer inspection of the Pokémon GO <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> reveals even more details: ”&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 15, 2025, Pokémon GO will release an update that increases the level cap from 50 to 80. This update will make the leveling journey more fun and engaging by celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more. And with this update, a number of players can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP. But don’t worry, no player will go down in level!”</p>



<p>The leveling system is being tweaked overall. According to the blog: “Players can earn levels more frequently,” and “some players may automatically jump in level on October 15.” </p>



<p>No one will move down levels, so you don’t need to worry about this.</p>

<p>Delta Force is finally available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while many had been excited for the free-to-play shooter, there is one feature missing that has fans concerned. Black Hawk Down, Delta Force’s campaign mode, offers players the option to either go alone or play in co-op. At least, that’s what it is on PC.</p>



<p>Loading into the mode on console only gives players the option of “Fighting Alone”. A visit to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/608668448981185838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s community page</a> on Steam and Discord reveal multiple discussions on the matter. However, neither the game’s developer Team Jade or publisher TiMi Studio Group have commented publicly.</p>



<p>“[It’s] sad because they said on 3 months ago crossplay and co-op campaign on consoles,” one user on the game’s Discord wrote. “[It’s] like they lie us [sic]”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Delta Force’s developer and publisher for comment on the missing co-op option. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down campaign not having co-op at launch? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dawn of War 4 Wants To Revitalize The RTS Genre and I think it can</p>
      </div>
<p>Dawn of War 4 will feature not one but four campaigns when it launches. The Space Marine, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus will headline their own series of missions, and each one of these groups bring unique units, buildings, and advantages to the battlefield.</p><p>The combined campaigns will feature over 70 missions, and the story is being co-written by Warhammer 40: Black Library author John French. Theysen added that multiplayer won't be forgotten and is being worked on, but the studio is primarily focused on crafting a single-player campaign that evokes a sensation of stepping back into the golden age of RTS games. "What we look most fondly back on when playing RTS games when we were all younger, or how that shaped our tastes in the genre, the single-player campaigns were one of the things that stuck the longest with us," Theysen added.</p><p>In addition to the single-player campaign, the game will also feature Last Stand and Skirmish modes alongside 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 multiplayer when it launches in 2026 for PC. In related news, Amazon's Warhammer 40,000 live-action adaptation--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/">with Superman actor Henry Cavill attached in a starring role</a>--is continuing at a steady pace, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40k-show-is-likely-still-years-away/1100-6533551/">but it's still years away from making its TV debut</a>.</p>

I played so many amazing games, spoke to just as many interesting devs, and ultimately, came away from the show excited about the future of gaming, despite the industry's many, many problems. It turns out, I was one of 357,000 visitors from 128 countries at the show this year. More than 34,000 trade visitors attended the show, and Gamescom saw the strongest growth in this sector from the U.S., China, Canada, and Japan.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3y4kS24z2yQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3y4kS24z2yQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Speaking of international participation, a total of 1,568 exhibitors from 72 countries participated on the show floor, "with a foreign share of 70%," according to a press release. "There were also 40 country pavilions representing 35 countries, including for the first time the pavilion of official partner country Thailand, along with Dubai and Kyrgyzstan."</p><p>Digitally, Gamescom 2025 reached new heights, too, garnering over 630 million views worldwide as of this past Saturday evening (Gamescom's final day was yesterday). Gamescom says that's a 105 percent increase compared to last year's show. Seventy-two million of those views were for Gamescom's Opening Night Live last Tuesday, marking an 80 percent increase in viewership compared to last year.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gamescom combines business and entertainment like no other event worldwide, as shown by 1,568 exhibitors spread across 233,000 square meters of gross exhibition space," Koelnmesse (the event hall) president and CEO Gerald Böse writes in a press release. "With record figures once again in nearly every category, the enormous variety of experiences and global participation, Gamescom is the most important event for the global gaming community."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h3>Here are Gamescom 2025 stats, at a glance:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><p>357,000&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;from 128 countries</p></li><li><p>Over 34,000 trade visitors, with the strongest growth from the US, China,&nbsp;Canada, and Japan</p></li><li><p>More than&nbsp;630 million views across the entire show program (as of Saturday evening) – an increase of 105 percent over the previous year</p></li><li><p>72 million views for Gamescom Opening Night Live (as of Saturday evening) – an increase of 80 percent over the previous year</p></li><li><p>5.7 million page views for Gamescom&nbsp;Epix (as of Saturday evening)</p></li><li><p>1,568 exhibitors from 72 countries, with a foreign share of 70 percent</p></li><li><p>40&nbsp;country&nbsp;pavilions&nbsp;from 35 countries</p></li><li><p>Approximately 233,000 square meters of gross exhibition space</p></li><li><p>Around 80,000 people at the Gamescom city festival</p></li></ul><p>We have a ton of coverage for Gamescom 2025 up on the <em>Game Informer </em>site, with many more previews for upcoming games to come, so check out some of the pieces so far:&nbsp;</p><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><hr><p><em>What was your favorite game shown during Gamescom 2025?

<p>The claim originally came from SwitchForce over on <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">X</a> (formerly Twitter), but VGC has also heard from multiple sources that a presentation is planned for <strong>12th September</strong>. If that's the case, it'll be taking place the day before the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros</a>.</p>
<p>The 12th <em>is</em> a Friday, which is a bit of an unusual day for a Direct, but Nintendo has previously held presentations on the last working day of the week, with the most-recent being an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>-focused one in 2021. Others have looked at Super Nintendo World (2020), the Wii U, and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-direct-presentation-full-broadcast-history-list">bigger general Direct in 2013</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Plus, besides 2024, Nintendo has held a Direct in September every single year, except last year. So a Direct in September is almost expected. Of course, as always, none of this is confirmed until Nintendo says anything, so remember that healthy pinch of salt!</p>

<p>One of the big reveals of this rumoured Direct will likely be Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release date. The game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">was recently rated</a>, meaning it's most likely ready. That and the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are the only big 2025 releases waiting on a date.</p>
<p>So, let's wait and see what happens, then.</p>

			<p>Two minutes past midnight on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">SwitchForce</a>, a leaker who has previously been accurate when making claims on Nintendo events, dropped a tease for a new Nintendo Direct coming next month, specifically, September 12, 2025. Following that tease, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/">VGC</a> corroborated SwitchForce's claim by reporting that its sources have stated a Nintendo Direct is coming mid-September, though they did not take a stab at the date.</p>



<p>VGC did, however, point out that there's been a Nintendo Direct in September for nearly as long as Nintendo Directs have been around, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOooMjvltuQbJgWKKYXh3mNz-5KKgkJS8-AvxntJwYVDaiACa8RKC">save for last year</a>, and that if it is on September 12, that would put the Direct one day ahead of the Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary.</p>



<p>While we've had leaks and reports accurately predict dates for these Direct events, what's always been less accurate in that kind of early reporting is the size of the event, regarding whether it'll be a full-blown general Direct, with first and third-party news. Or, if it's just a third-party Partner Showcase, or an Indie World Direct, or a Direct focused entirely on one game.</p>



<p>The most recent Nintendo Direct presentation was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay-deep-dive/">Kirby Air Riders-dedicated showcase, </a>with Masahiro Sakurai spending 45 minutes detailing everything you'll need to know about the return of the cult-classic racer. Before that, it was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase</a>, and before that, we had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-pauline-gameplay-details/">Donkey Kong Bananza-focused Direct</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World Direct</a>.</p>



<p>In April, when Nintendo finally revealed the Nintendo Switch 2, was the last time we had a general Nintendo Direct. Hopefully, with three Directs focused on one specific game and a partner showcase between April and now, we're due for a bigger, general Direct that debuts what Nintendo has planned for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>Namely, the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is one announcement that could appear tomorrow. The last we heard, it was due for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/"> late 2025 release</a>. There was also a playable demo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> in Germany and Fan Expo in Canada.</p>
