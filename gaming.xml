The company, completely by surprise, has released a new Fire Emblem game for mobile devices called Fire Emblem Shadows, and it’s an unlikely blend of strategy and social deduction.</p><p>Fire Emblem Shadows gives players control of a party of warriors, and asks them to choose between Light and Shadow.

			<p>During yesterday's State of Play, Bandai Namco shared a new Code Vein II trailer that unveiled the game's release date. The sequel to 2019's Soulslike action RPG will release on January 30, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $69.99, the Deluxe Edition priced at $89.99 (including 3-day early access, the Mask of Idris expansion DLC coming in January 2027, and a Custom Outfit Pack with three costume sets and one weapon), and the Ultimate Edition priced at $99.99 with all the above plus a digital mini artbook and soundtrack and a Character Costume Set that comes with six costumes based on characters from the original game.</p>



<p>A Collector's Edition is also exclusively available <a href="https://t.co/9GBTiLv45w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Bandai Namco Store</a>. Priced at $179.99, it gets players all the aforementioned digital bonuses and the following physical goodies:</p>



<ul>
<li>60-page 25x25cm artbook</li>



<li>18cm figurine of character Lou Magmell</li>



<li>Exclusive Steelbook</li>
</ul>



<p>Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced during Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. This sequel builds upon the previous installment's foundation to improve in key areas, as outlined in a new gameplay presentation video that you'll find embedded below.</p>



<p>To begin with, the character creation system is much more robust and detailed than in the original, allowing customization of details such as eyes, hair, scars, and even outfits, hats, masks, and accessories. Being a Soulslike, the combat system is of paramount importance. The developers are evolving it by introducing new weapon types and strategies, such as the bayonet weapon, which blends ranged and melee combat and requires ammunition. The game also retains the core mechanic of building up bleed status on enemies to capitalize with jail attacks, but now the jail weapon types vary more, giving players tactical flexibility tailored to their style. The boss fights promise to be more epic thanks to multi-phase battles and more dynamic enemy abilities. </p>



<p>The companion system was also significantly expanded. In Code Vein II, companions not only fight alongside the player but can even be “assimilated” to provide passive buffs and additional powers. Each companion also has unique abilities, such as Lou, the revenant who can control time.</p>



<p>Narratively, the game introduces a stronger focus on time travel, with the protagonist and companions traveling to the past to save the future. The world exploration also sounds more interactive, with map objects that unlock new areas and crafting mechanics involving consumables like flour for creating buffs and healing items.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's September State of Play event, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the final launch date for its long-awaited game Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>The open world action/adventure title will be available starting on March 19, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now across all platforms, with the Standard Edition priced $69.99 and a Digital Deluxe Edition priced $79.99. The latter provides access to some in-game extra cosmetics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kairos Plate Helm</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Gloves</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Boots</li>



<li>Kairos Cloak</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Armor</li>



<li>Balgran Shield</li>



<li>Exclaire Champron</li>



<li>Exclaire Barding</li>



<li>Exclaire Saddle</li>



<li>Exclaire Stirrups</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Deluxe Edition will be available for $10 more and also includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deluxe Edition Limited SteelBook</li>



<li>Map of Pywel</li>



<li>Letter from the Developer</li>



<li>Greymane Brooch Pin</li>



<li>3 Character Photo Cards</li>



<li>3 Patches</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Collector's Edition is priced at $279.99 and adds a stunning 17” Diorama as well as a digital Ultimate Pack that gives players a Tormented Soul Bow, Derictus Spear, Sielos Longsword, Shroud Lantern, and Hyperion Horse Tack Set. All Crimson Desert pre-orders also include the Khaled Shield, and all PS5 pre-orders get the exclusive Grotevant Plate Set. This may be all that remains of t<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hat rumor from two years ago about Pearl Abyss partnering with Sony on the game</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the game's pre-orders opening, Pearl Abyss also updated its <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously shared PC system requirements</a>. The minimum specs are exactly the same, but the recommended specs have been greatly reduced from the previous recommendations of Ryzen 7 7700X / i7-13700K CPU and RTX 4070 SUPER / RX 7800 XT GPU to Ryzen 5 5600 / i5-11600K and RTX 2080 / RX 6700 XT, likely as a result of ongoing optimization. The Steam page also now lists the macOS requirements, which we have reported below:</p>



<p><strong>MINIMUM:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 15<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M1<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics: </strong>M1<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 135 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>RECOMMENDED:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 26<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M4 Pro<br><strong>Memory: </strong>16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> M3 Pro<br><strong>Storage: </strong>150 GB available space</p>



<p>Crimson Desert is powered by the rather impressive proprietary BlackSpace Engine, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have covered in detail in our GDC 2025 report</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The end of the road is finally in sight for the second triple-A game developed by the studio currently known for the MMORPG Black Desert. Crimson Desert was originally announced pre-COVID at G-Star 2019 and even had a Winter 2021 launch window at some point before <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being delayed indefinitely</a>. Initially, the game was meant to feature some MMO-like elements, but it was revamped into a full-fledged single player action/adventure title, which inevitably required a lot of work. </p>



<p>It won't be long before we judge for ourselves whether the change and the wait were worth it. In the meantime, stay tuned for additional Crimson Desert coverage.</p>

This is noticeable early on during the <strong>altar puzzle</strong>, the game's first puzzle sequence you'll encounter. If this early puzzle has you stumped, don't worry, we have the solution right here to help you. Here's how to solve the <strong>Silent Hill f altar puzzle</strong>.</p><h2>Silent Hill f - altar puzzle guide</h2><p>This first puzzle won't be as tricky as some of those you'll encounter later, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-shrine-vault-puzzle-guide/1100-6534872/" data-ref-id="1100-6534872">shrine vault puzzle</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f locker codes</a>, but it may still stump you if you've not noticed a key detail that reveals the answer.</p><p>When you reach the altar, you'll find five stands and five items, or "offerings," before you on plates. It may be immediately apparent that you must place the items in a specific order, but the related poem sure leaves you guessing. The five offerings include a vase, a paper fan, and three dead animals, each of them dressed in some kind of ceremonial wrappings, including a bird, mouse, and fish.</p><p>The alter poem, as confusing as it is, reads:</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p><strong>Altar</strong></p><p>Thy restless heart betrays thee as unfit for this auspicious day.</p><p>Thou must first pay respect to the gods and the spirit of thine ancestors.</p><p>A restless heart leads to a corrupt soul.</p><p>Only through sufficient offerings laid upon many stands may thy soul be cleaned.</p></div><p>If you tried relying on just this poem for the answer, you'd probably have better luck using simple trial and error. It's not very clear at all. Instead, the answer is in the details on the offerings themselves. If you interact with each offering, you'll see that you can spin them. Do so and you'll notice each has a symbol somewhere on them that matches the symbols on one of the altar's stands.</p><p>With this in mind, you simply need to place each offering on the altar that matches its symbol. If you're still stumped, don't fret. Here's the answer, plain as day to help you.</p><h2>Silent Hill f altar puzzle solution</h2><p>From left to right:</p><ol><li>Fan - front left</li><li>Fish - back left</li><li>Vase - front middle</li><li>Bird - back right</li><li>Mouse - front right</li></ol><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367" data-ratio="0.57242063492063" data-width="1008" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill f altar puzzle answer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png"></figure><p>Placing the offerings in this order will immediately solve the puzzle and initiate a cutscene.

From this point on, the Bonuses tab should unlock automatically when accessing one of these shrines. <strong>Open the Bonuses tab to obtain all of your pre-order items</strong>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Koei Tecmo ups the gameplay ante on its musou Zelda spinoff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2020’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity gave us an expanded look on a time in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s history only whispered about in a few flashback cutscenes. The new Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment seems to be following this trend by taking us even further back in time to the founding of Hyrule and the imprisoning of Ganondorf, of which only fragments were shown in Tears of the Kingdom. Just as Tears expanded on everything Breath of the Wild had to offer, Age of Imprisonment seems to be equally upping the stakes, both in taking advantage of the Switch 2’s increased horsepower and showing off some new and welcome features to the hack ‘n slash spinoff series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo I played (which is now also available to attendees of the Tokyo Game Show) comprised a 10-minute chunk of an early mission that also sought to capitalize on Tears of the Kingdom’s new discoveries: exploring The Depths. Given that this creepy underground area effectively doubled the size of Hyrule, I’m excited to see where these types of missions can lead, and what horrors we’ll find lurking in the dark (I can’t be the only one hoping we get some acknowledgement of the creepy giant statues). This iteration of Hyrule Warriors seemed to run a lot smoother on the Switch 2 and I couldn’t spot any dips in the framerate while wading into combat, but being in an early enclosed area it’s hard to say if Nintendo’s new console was truly being put through its paces.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I began the mission as Zelda, still adjusting to being thrown backwards in time during the events of Tears of the Kingdom, with the ancient Zonai beings Rauru and Minera escorting her toward sacred sites of power hidden away in the Depths. After equipping myself with a few Zonai devices to use in battle, it wasn’t long before I was mowing through enemies in true Dynasty Warriors “musou” style. This time around, Zelda has put down the sheikah slate in favor of a lightsaber, mixing in more straightforward sword slashes with the ability to shoot light arrows from afar, or recall her sword as it dances around to cut swaths through enemies. It’s a great way to make her less of a technical fighter and more of an easy to pick up all-rounder stand-in for Link (who couldn’t make it on account of the whole time travel thing).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zelda has put down the sheikah slate in favor of a lightsaber. It’s a great way to make her less of a technical fighter and more of an easy to pick up all-rounder stand-in for Link.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I was only able to play as three different characters during the demo, I have to hand it to Mineru for stealing the show. Her ability to pull out random complex Zonai death contraptions was something I never got tired of. Whether it was driving a giant spiky four-wheeler of destruction through enemies, or simply hopping onto a giant tire to ride side-saddle instead of running, Mineru has so far proven to be the Green Lantern of this universe with her ability to pull out the wildest creations out of nowhere. Many of her crazier constructs – like summoning a spinning paddle to whack giant orbs into enemies like a bowling ball – had me itching to go back to Tears of the Kingdom to see if I could recreate these death traps myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though only Mineru got to summon complex machines, each character was able to gather singular Zonai devices to be used in battle as consumable items, and deployed in a few ways. At first I was whipping out my flame emitter to mow down groups of little Frox enemies, but later I was able to set one down to continuously burn a Construct Captain while I flanked from the side with more direct attacks, making it an effective 1-2 punch combo. All devices will drain your battery, making their deployment a tactical choice unless you’ve stockpiled battery rechargers. I was only able to mess around with a few, but with different characters using devices in various manners, there’s a lot of room to find great times to deploy them – especially on boss fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with deploying devices, holding R also allows you to activate special unique skills in combat that cover wide areas and blast through the opposition with some bombastic attacks. Each character I got to play had two different abilities, and I was also able to map them alongside Zonai devices for easy use. While they can be used to mow through hordes of grunts, they really shine when facing tougher bosses and captains that stand between you and your objectives. Even the most generic of construct captains can employ strong unblockable attacks that can cover a wide area and do heavy damage, signified by a glowing aura that spreads out from them. Koei Tecmo has seemingly taken a page from another of its action series, Nioh, in presenting the best way to stop an unblockable strike is to overpower it with one of your own. Being able to anticipate, react, and shut down a deadly foe with a trick of my own was immensely satisfying and rewarding (and at least this early on, I was given a pretty generous reaction time before their attack would unleash).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I also appreciate the steps Age of Imprisonment has taken to make your allies feel more tangible, as they are now able to assist you in battle with bigger attacks when you’re running out of skills to deploy. In one instance, a boss readied its charge attack, while both of Zelda’s skills were still on cooldown. Suddenly I was given the option to swap to Rauru waiting on the other side of the arena, and I was able to deploy his unique skill to intercept the boss and save Zelda in a moment that felt truly cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An even bigger upgrade to making more use of your allies is a new ability - a sync strike that can be triggered when you and your ally have dealt enough damage to fill a meter. This lit up their portraits on the side, and also helpfully showed when I was in range of a character to perform the strike with by highlighting the ground to the person in range. Not only are these moves as dramatic as they are powerful, but they’re also unique to the two characters you sync up, opening up the floor for a lot of possibilities and tactics. Pairing up Zelda and Rauru allowed me to shoot out twin beams of light that I could aim independently with each control stick to focus on two bosses at once, while having Zelda synch up with Mineru for a strike let her ride on the back of the Zonai’s mech to wade into battle alternating powerful slams and magic explosions. Given the nature of some of these attacks, I’m really hoping that co-op play will allow each player to direct their own attacks during these sync strikes, though nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though my time with the demo was criminally short, I’m already looking forward to seeing how more of its characters fight in sync – especially the tiny korok musketeer and enigmatic looking Zonai construct that looks very similar to a notably absent hero. Luckily I’ll only have just over a month to wait until Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment arrives on November 6th.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-evolved-into-an-even-better-legend-of-zelda-complement]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here's a new trailer to make up for it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some breaking news from Level-5, with the company today confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> will no longer arrive on the Switch and Switch 2 this year.</p>
<p>This update comes alongside the latest trailer at the Tokyo Game Show. It's now scheduled to arrive at some point in 2026. Here's the <a href="https://www.layton.jp/jouki/en/topics/250925/">official statement via the Layton website</a>, which notes how the team wants to deliver the title in the "best possible form":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LEVEL5 Inc. would like to begin by offering its sincere apologies to all fans who have been looking forward to the release of Professor Layton and the New World of Steam. Although the release was originally scheduled for 2025, in order to deliver the game in the best possible form, the launch has been rescheduled for 2026. We deeply regret any inconvenience this delay may cause and greatly appreciate your understanding and continued support."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the trailer above, you'll be able to hear the "brand-new music composed for this adventure" which also gives fans a "first glimpse of the steam-powered town, Steam Bison, and Layton and Luke's classic back-and-forth".</p>
<p>When we hear more about when exactly this new entry will be releasing for Nintendo's platforms, we'll let you know. This new Professor Layton outing was originally revealed by Level-5 in 2023 and was targeting a 2025 launch until this latest delay.</p>
<p>In some other delay news, 2K Games yesterday announced it would push back the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> on the Switch 2.</p>

Google apparently agrees. Today, it’s finally elevated its <em>Epic v. Google</em> case, the one that might <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">fracture its control over the entire Android app ecosystem</a>, to the Supreme Court level. Google has now confirmed it will appeal its case to the Supreme Court, and in the meanwhile, it’s asking the Court to press pause one more time on the permanent injunction that would start taking away its control.</p><p>On September 12th, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that permanent injunction and gave Google until October to stop forcing app developers to use its Google Play Billing for payments, allow them to link to other ways to pay and other places to download apps, set their own prices, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778332/google-epic-play-store-lawsuit-30-days-supreme-court#:~:text=do%20by%20October%3F-,Here%E2%80%99s%20the%20TL%3BDR%3A,-Stop%20Google%20from">and more</a>.</p><p>But the Supreme Court might see it differently.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-character-tier-list-season-4.1308009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The balance of power has changed once again in Marvel Rivals Season 4, which introduced plenty of hero adjustments to shake things up. If you're wondering which characters are routinely dominating lobbies, or who we think is perhaps a more situational choice, we've got you covered with our Marvel Rivals Season 4 tier list. Below, you'll find our ranking, with S rank being the strongest characters and D being the weakest.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Tier List</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>S-Tier:</strong> Emma Frost, Doctor Strange, Magneto, Wolverine, Loki</li><li><strong>A-Tier:</strong> The Thing, Groot, Thor, Magik, Namor, Psylocke, Angela, The Punisher, Winter Soldier, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Luna Snow, Phoenix</li><li><strong>B-Tier:</strong> Peni Parker, Venom, Hela, Human Torch, Iron Man, Moon Knight, Spider-Man, Invisible Woman, Ultron, Hulk, Iron Fist, Captain America, Squirrel Girl, Black Panther, Rocket Raccoon</li><li><strong>C-Tier:</strong> Hawkeye, Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Storm, Adam Warlock, Mantis, Scarlet Witch</li><li><strong>D-Tier:</strong> Black Widow, Jeff the Land Shark</li></ul><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>S-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Emma Frost</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Emma Frost has been a force to be reckoned with ever since she debuted in Season 2; she's a good old-fashioned tank. With Emma, you can run up to the front line and clear a path for your team to move forward, and even throw up a shield to defend her teammates. But the best part is her Diamond form, which she can use to essentially shut down any incoming dives and cut off potential ultimates that require a build-up. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Doctor Strange</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all the tinkering, Doctor Strange remains one of the best characters. He can fit into any build and is incredibly useful: he can shield himself and everyone around him, and with a well-placed attack, he can be a distraction for the frontline while popping some shots at healers. The best thing about him is his portal. When this is used in overtime, it can make all the difference between winning or losing a round.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Magneto</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Magneto is an excellent hero for a lot of the same reasons as Doctor Strange. They play very similarly to one another and can both fit into any build. What makes him especially dangerous, though, is his ult: if timed right, it can one-shot a Cloak &amp; Dagger, Luna Snow, or Invisible Woman while <em>they</em> ult.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wolverine</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Wolverine is a constant threat in any circumstance. Even though he's small in size, he has a large presence on the battlefield. Much of Wolverine's kit is built around diving the backline or making a hole for the team to push through. A well-placed Wolverine can easily make all the difference, because if he's not making the healers run for their lives, he's bullying the tanks in front. If that's not dangerous enough, he can heal himself and get away on a moment's notice. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Loki</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Loki is a multipurpose healer, thanks to his clones. He may be one of the most complex characters to master, but learning him is well worth it. His clones can be used to set up a line of fire that can hold down a position until backup arrives, and being able to confuse your opponents about who's the real one can buy your team time to attack. If you ever find yourself in a close battle, his ability to turn himself into whatever character he wants can make all the difference in a close fight.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>A-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">The Thing</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's The Thing… he's just great. This orange pile of rocks is easily one of the best additions to a support tank. His recent buffs last season have made him even more dangerous, because not only can he shut down dive players, but he can now smack flyers out of the sky. He's straightforward in that he only has a couple of attacks, but each one can pack a serious punch. If you're looking for a tank that can rush straight into a fight, The Thing is the one for you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Groot</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Groot has always been good right from the start, but he's lost some of his flair throughout the last couple of seasons. He's still a danger whenever he pops up in a game, though. Being able to wall off opponents and prevent them from escaping or getting healed is an absolute game-changer. If you find yourself being terrorized by a diver, you can simply trap them in the backfield and quickly take care of them before they become more of a threat.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Thor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Thor has slowly been improving since Season 1. He wasn't much use initially, and getting a lot of mileage out of him required some real planning. But thanks to a handful of buffs he's received, he's now one of the standout characters. Like the Hulk, he can be played in a couple of different ways, meaning that you can have him on the frontline and take some damage, or you can dive the backfield with him to create a distraction. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Magik</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really hard to go wrong with Dive heroes. Even though they're extremely annoying to deal with, having one on your team can make you feel like an unstoppable force of nature. Magik is easily one of the best dive characters to have, largely because of the portals she can set up that allow her to get from A to B as quickly as possible. This, paired with her high damage combos, makes her a great addition to any team.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Namor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to shut down <em>and</em> have dive potential with the same character, Namor is the perfect choice. He thrives at playing the backfield and can take pop shots at anyone he sees. Plus, setting up squids in key spots where your healers are is enough to prevent anyone from sneaking up on you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Psylocke</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a highly mobile hero with a high damage output, Psylocke is the perfect one to play. Even though she's not necessarily a dive character, she can absolutely play like one. Perhaps the most dangerous thing about Psylocke is her ult. If you happen to catch one or two people by themselves in the backline, she can easily eliminate them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Angela</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Angela is the latest hero to join the game's ever-growing cast of characters, and she's already made a big name for herself. Having a flying tank is game-changing, and what's nice is that there aren't a lot of people who can really counter her while in the air. She can be played like a dive character, but she can also take a lot of damage on the frontline thanks to her shield. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Punisher</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Punisher has always been a solid character and fits into just about every list. Even though all of his attacks are ranged, you can still get up and close thanks to his shotgun. He's excellent at holding down areas due to his machine gun turret and ability to shut down a lot of flyers who may be in the area. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Winter Soldier</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It often feels like the Winter Soldier is one of Netease's favorite characters. It's hard to think of a time when he was ever bad. Like The Punisher, he can fit into any list and can fill plenty of different roles; For example, he's adept at dealing with flyers and can shut down any dives thanks to his hook attack. On top of that, his ult allows him to clear large groups all at once.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cloak &amp; Dagger</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Cloak &amp; Dagger are perhaps one of the most straightforward healers to learn, and have a huge presence on the battlefield. You don't even need to hit someone with your heals; as long as you get the general area, you'll heal them. Being able to switch between characters that also assist with damage and blinding enemies is a huge bonus, too, and a well-timed ult can easily pave the way to the objective when need be.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Luna Snow</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Luna is a healer, that doesn't mean she can't dish out some damage. If, for some reason, you find yourself on the frontline, you can freeze someone to give your team some time to line up an attack. This is also a great way to fight off anyone trying to dive at her. Similar to Cloak &amp; Dagger, her ult can guide a struggling team to touch the objective and give them a fighting chance.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Phoenix</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a Phoenix on the team is never a bad idea. Most of her attacks dish out a lot of damage, and having her in the backfield to serve as a sniper is perhaps one of the best things she can do. Plus, having her paired up with a Wolverine is a match made in heaven, and if your team happens to be giving up ground, her ult will make sure that's taken care of right away.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>B-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Peni Parker</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Peni can really shine in certain situations. Specifically, when you're on defense on the Convergence map, or when you're playing Domination, her ability to set up nests and plant mines is extremely useful. These mines can easily take out one or two heroes if they're not paying attention, or at least damage another tank enough for someone else to finish the job. Plus, her ability to web characters and stun them out of an ult makes her especially  dangerous.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Venom</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to diving, Venom is a great character to play, but he's not the best fit in every game. You'll need at least one other diver to help, and if no one else is playing tank, you'll leave everyone on the frontline to deal with everything on their own. But don't let that deter you, because you can often buy your team enough time to run up the field if you focus on the healers and more squishy characters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hela</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a poke character is never a bad idea. Hela is one of the most dangerous characters in the game. She has high damage input, and her ult only amplifies that. Thankfully, Season 4 is helping her even more with the new Symbiote Shenanigans team-up. If you're looking to stop the enemy team's range characters, she's a good counter to most of them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Human Torch</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Johnny just has a certain flair. A well-placed Human Torch can be very scary. As a flyer, he always has a good view of everything, can dish out a lot of damage, and can get away relatively fast. Although First Steps may not be the most powerful team-up, being able to drop The Thing in the backfield is enough to disrupt the backfield for your team to push up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Iron Man</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Man excels when he's paired up with the right people (Ultron, mainly). But he can also stand on his own with his kit, shooting at folks from a distance. Being able to terrorize a tank with what sometimes feels like an ultimate beam is great in just about any situation. His ult still remains one of the best in the game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Moon Knight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Moon Knight has seen a lot of nerfs and buffs, but he's always been a reliable hero to have on your team for a couple of key reasons. One of them is Ankh, which allows him to damage multiple people at once and dish out a lot of damage while doing it. On top of that, his ult is a great way to clear out anyone  standing on the objective.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Spider-Man</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Spider-Man used to be an absolute menace, like J. Jonah Jameson used to claim. Even though he's seen a lot of nerfs and changes that don't make him as scary anymore, don't let that fool you because he still is, in the right hands. Being able to grab just about anyone and throw them off the map with his webs is still one of the scariest things about him, and that's without mentioning how fast he is in being able to escape any danger he might find himself in. As a healer, nothing is scarier than seeing the webbed menace coming your way.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Invisible Woman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Invisible Woman is an ideal pick whenever you have any of the other Fantastic Four members on your team, because her team-up allows them to heal teammates in the heat of battle on their own. On top of that, she's great at trapping divers from escaping thanks to her push ability, and if she does get caught, she can easily turn invisible and run somewhere safe. Like Cloak &amp; Dagger and Luna Snow, her ult can make all the difference in a key fight.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ultron</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultron is great to have on your team, but only if you have a healer like Cloak &amp; Dagger, Luna Snow, or Invisible Woman. This is because he can't deliver as many heals as most of them can. But he makes up for it when it comes to damage output, and this is especially true when the Stark Protocol is in play. Playing Ultron can always be a gamble because you often sacrifice heals for damage, and his ult only reflects that, which can often cost important fights. But if you can place your drones on the right characters, this<em> can</em> be avoided.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hulk</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulk can be a mixed bag at times. Even though he has a lot of mobility, it can often come at a cost. Whenever he's on the field, it often feels he's often targeted by the entire lobby. But if you're able to maintain composure, you can remind them why Hulk is the strongest there is. Similar to Thor, he can be played on the frontlines, or you can jump your way to the backfield and attempt to take out a healer or two.  Even though his attacks consist of his right and left hands, they can pack a serious punch. Whenever the Gamma Charge is in play, the combo is strong enough that you're almost guaranteed to shut down dives.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Iron Fist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Fist has always been a blast to play. Nothing beats jumping into the backfield and giving the enemy healer the good one-two combo. Plus, if you're good enough with him, you can easily solo just about any tank that comes your way. It's worth mentioning, though, he requires a lot of skill to play well and can die extremely fast.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Captain America</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Captain America is a lot like Iron Fist because he's a lot of fun to play, but he's a tricky character to learn. He used to be one of the most standout tanks, but due to a series of buffs, that's sadly no longer the case. Captain America doesn't fit into a lot of builds anymore and is more of a situational tank for when you're looking to jump on the point or distract the team for a while. But if you learn how to properly play him, he can easily be one of the most dangerous heroes on the field.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Squirrel Girl</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Squirrel Girl is often a safe pick whenever you find yourself playing on a Convergence or Domination map. It's because you can often hide someone in the corner and spam acorns, and you're almost guaranteed to get a hit. Even with her most recent nerf, she's still worth picking because of how easy she is to play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Panther</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Panther has always been a character to watch out for. This is especially true thanks to the Gamma Charge team-up that he's now part of. Even though he's not as strong as he was in Season 3.5, he's still a danger on the field.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rocket Raccoon</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Rocket Raccoon can be a challenging hero to play, but if you have a good one on your team, you'll be set up for success. This is largely due to how small he is; he's often an easy target to miss. Plus, if everyone is dead on point, he can easily run around in circles for a few seconds without being caught. Like Cloak &amp; Dagger, you don't need to hit someone with your heals because they'll receive it as long as you shoot it in their general area. The other thing that really makes him sense is his respawn beacon that'll bring back one person as soon as they're killed. One thing you really need to be smart about, though, is where you place his ult, because of how quickly it can be destroyed. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>C-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Hawkeye</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hawkeye has always been a character that's hard to master, but he's gotten a little bit easier to play thanks to a series of buffs and team-ups that he's a part of. Being able to one-shot a lot of enemies with a well-placed headshot is always a good feeling. Plus, his ability to hit just about anyone with his ult is why he's not lower on this list.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mister Fantastic</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until Season 3.5, Mister Fantastic was a solid pick because he could easily double as a tank if need be. Thanks to a series of nerfs, though, he's no longer as good as he used to be. But one thing he still shines at is shutting down dives, and this is thanks to his ability to hit people at a distance. So even if they are getting away, you can potentially eliminate them before they flee to safety. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star-Lord</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Peter has had quite the journey since the game's launch. He used to be one of the best characters to play, but sadly, that's no longer the case. That being said, he can still dish out a lot of damage, and his ult can be good if there's not a shield character on the other team. That being said, there's often a lot working against him, and you're usually better off with another Duelist hero.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Storm</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, Storm falls into the same category as Star-Lord. She's, by all accounts, a fun character to play, but many other flyers are more ideal than her. Even with the Jeff-Nado team-up, it's not worth having her or Jeff on the team when there are many better options to pick from. But the one thing that really makes her stand out is her ability to buff the team if they're within her radius, and at times, this can make a difference during a fight.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Adam Warlock</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Adam Warlock has always been a risky healer to play. Like Ultron, he doesn't have many moves to heal people. The heals he does have are placed on cooldowns, and if you're not smart with them, you can easily set up your team for failure. It is worth mentioning that even though his ult is useful, if done in a poor location, it'll usually be a waste of time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mantis</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mantis is another healer who can be a bit of a gamble. Even though she has some useful items in her kit, like the ability to stun enemies, her healing output isn't the best. The same can be said about her ult, which often feels like a weaker version of Luna Snow's.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Scarlet Witch</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet Witch is an ideal character if you're new to the game. That being said, there are a lot of better options out there. Even though she can dish out a lot of damage, there's a lot working against her. One prime example of this is her ult, because anyone with a shield can block it, and she can be stunned out of it with Emma or Penni.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>D-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Widow</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Widow has always had a tough time in Marvel Rivals. She's easily the least powerful Duelist in the game, even with the buffs and team-ups she's received. Oftentimes, it's not worth playing her if you're looking to go poke, when other heroes like Hela do a better job than her and require less skill.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jeff the Land Shark</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Jeff the Land Shark has a simple kit to understand, that's where a lot of his usefulness ends. He has a poor output rate as a healer, and there are often better picks than him. On top of that, his ult is less than ideal for a healer, because if you find yourself in a key battle where both healers use their ults, his will often feel like a waste and end up costing the fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luis Joshua Gutierrez is a freelance writer who loves games.

It builds on the franchise’s signature “buzz” mechanic while introducing new characters, refined controls, and a variety of game modes. With its seven unique pilots, each with distinct abilities and scoring systems, it also remains faithful to its Arcade roots while delivering enhanced replay value and accessibility for today’s players.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Psyvariar 3</em> takes place many years after the events of <em>Psyvariar 2</em>. After the fall of ETA, a faction of Psyvariars declared that Earth was too precious to be forsaken. They vowed to reclaim and colonize it once more, with GUIS rising from its ashes to resume its original mission.</p><p>Decades pass. The Earth colony thrives. Then… a signal. Alien. Unknown.</p><p>The moment Gluon particles are detected, dread spreads like fire. The skies darken with a familiar terror—Earth is under siege once again.

                <p dir="ltr">I recently got to play around 20 minutes of the newest Hyrule Warriors game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" data-ref-id="5000-671281">Age of Imprisonment</a>, and there's a lot for fans of Zelda and Musou games to be interested in. For the former, it'll come as exciting news that Age of Imprisonment is canon. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity/" data-ref-id="5000-518353">Age of Calamity</a> was pretty wishy-washy with alternate timeline ideas, Nintendo is going all-in for its follow-up and making everything you see in Age of Imprisonment true to the mainline story. We all know what happens in the end with Ganondorf, but there are, of course, a lot of questions about what happened before and after.</p><p dir="ltr">From a gameplay standpoint, Age of Imprisonment will let players get their hands on a good variety of characters from the canon and, given what I saw from just Zelda, Rauru, and Mineru, this is a <em>very</em> good roster filled with very exciting prospects.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Beyond the Legend – Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">During my time with Age of Imprisonment, we got to head underground with Rauru, Mineru, and Zelda, the latter of whom mentions that it is her first time in the depths and that she didn't know it existed. Mineru explains that the depths have multiple sites of sacred power and that she's been collecting constructs for her research. She wasn't able to investigate the depths on her own until Zelda and her powers of light came along to give them the ole' beatdown.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character, of course, had their unique style in combat, with Zelda both slashing with a strange Zonaite sword and wielding magical light projectiles; Rauru using spear and beam attacks; and Mineru utilizing a bunch of contraptions cobbled together from Zonai equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt right at home plowing through Little Frox, Frox, and Constructs, as someone who played a whole lot of Age of Calamity, but even those with <em>some</em> experience with any Musou game will likely find it easy to pick up. From the first game, you still have your regular and strong attack combos, dashes, flurry rushes, guarding, weakpoint smashes, crafting materials; the whole shebang. Attacks are flashy, have massive areas of effect, and are always fun to dole out punishment with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574317" data-ratio="0.5625641025641" data-width="1950" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574317"></a><figcaption>There are a lot of playable characters in this game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The R button menu has changed from the Sheikah Slate to unique skills in Age of Imprisonment. There's both a powerful dashing and vertical attack, and Zonai devices to either use whenever you'd like, or, in a better use case, can be used to counter an enemy's ability and slap 'em back in the face. The Y dashing version counters opponents dashing towards you, such as the construct's forward lunge, which has been pulled straight out of Tears of the Kingdom. The X version counters aerial or jumping attacks, such as the Frox's leap attack. These attacks can be used on their own for extra damage, but hitting specific counters seems much more worthwhile as they offer an opportunity to execute an extra follow-up at the end. These attacks have a cooldown, just like before with a successful use of a slate ability. The interesting thing is the A and B buttons are customizable Zonai equipment, each with specific properties that are changeable in the directional pad's right menu. This lets you switch your loadout on the fly depending on what the enemies' weaknesses are. The Zonai equipment uses Zonai batteries, which need to be replenished, however.</p><p dir="ltr">The cool thing about this is that some equipment can be placed into the environment and will operate automatically without your input, which can up the damage-dealing potential available. Since there's no friendly fire, there's a lot of opportunity to, for example, drop a flame emitter and work it into your overwhelming offense--thank Hylia.</p><p dir="ltr">Enemies also have traits and weaknesses that carry over from Tears of the Kingdom. Frox eat bombs, for example, and they're still weak to shots to the eye or attacks to their backside ores. That means that if you played Tears, you'll have a major leg up on the general idea of how to take on what you're up against.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574319"></a><figcaption>Zelda has a lot of slashing and light-based attacks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Where it really changes from Age of Calamity though is Sync Strikes. This is not just because it's a powerful attack that requires two characters, but it's <em>because</em> it needs two characters, and the nature of Musou games requires you to divide and conquer the map, making you strategize when characters should work together or go separately. This is an interesting twist on how these types of games are usually played.</p><p dir="ltr">Sync Strike attacks are the biggest game-changer in my opinion, because in the Age of Calamity, most characters were undertaking solo ventures and attacking different points of the map. But Sync attacks are so powerful that having two characters working together feels like a reliable way to plow through an enemy quickly and save time. This encourages you to strategize and always reconsider where to send units for best possible results, especially since Sync Strike attacks are slow to charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Sync Strike attack pair up varies depending on who is partaking and what you get ranges from multi-directional beams you can control to a completely alternate form like Mineru's powered-up construct. This means that some of these attacks will likely be better or worse in some situations, so there will no doubt be plenty of opportunities to test and experiment to optimize builds and runs. Just thinking about the final possible roster for this game and designing an interacting Sync attack across all characters sounds like a very daunting task, but as players, that means there's likely to be plenty of depth.</p><p>While the preview was fairly short, with a little teaser at the end, I got a pretty good idea of how good Age of Imprisonment feels, and it feels <em>damn</em> good. I think the fact that this game already has good legs, and I'm yet to see the characters I really want to see just makes me more excited for its release on November 6.</p>
