<p>There are too many wacky video game concepts to list, from Goat Simulator to the upcoming Squirrel With a Gun, many of which bring mayhem and mesmerizing moments. Well, as it turns out, they can get a touch crazier over time. Squirrel With a Gun is the perfect example, in which you play as a squirrel…with a gun. The team intends to keep up with the crazy concept by introducing several free updates as post-launch support in Squirrel With a Gun!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-to-squirrel-with-a-gun-post-launch">What’s Coming to Squirrel With a Gun Post-Launch?</h2>



<p>It’s always welcome seeing an upcoming indie game planning for the absolute best. Developer Dee Dee Creations already has a full year of post-launch updates in store for Squirrel With a Gun, some of which may prove game-changing in the best of ways. Others, however, seem like more quality-of-life, which is always a plus in my book!</p>

<ul>
<li>September 2024 – Photo Mode</li>



<li>December 2024 – New Level (Super Platforming Challenge)</li>



<li>December 2024 – A New Rival</li>



<li>February 2025 – Outfit Variety Pack</li>



<li>March 2025 – Gravity Gun</li>



<li>June 2025 – Squirr-LGBT</li>



<li>August 2025 – The Varmint Collection</li>
</ul>



<p>I’m most excited about a photo mode, the new rival, and a gravity gun. Something about a squirrel with a gravity gun sounds so enticing.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-squirrel-with-a-gun">When Can You Play Squirrel With a Gun?</h2>



<p>The wait to play Squirrel With a Gun is nearly over, as the indie action platformer launches on August 29 on PC. It’s also coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, albeit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-gets-october-2024-release-date-for-xbox-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in October</a>. </p>



<p>You can pre-order the game now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067050/Squirrel_with_a_Gun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. For a short period, the price will be reduced from $19.99 to $17.99, thanks to a welcome 10% discount. </p>



<p>For that price, and based on our hands-on playthrough of the game recently, it’s worth every penny. You’ll easily get your money’s worth as the mayhem ramps up with each new level!</p>



<hr>



<p>Squirrel With a Gun may be a summer blockbuster, with plenty of whacky antics for players to lose themselves. You can bet Insider Gaming plans to play it on day one!</p>

It was one of the best games to grace the console back then amidst a sea of other incredible titles, and Nintendo did a great job of staying faithful to the game's charm and fun factor. A whole slew of improvements have been implemented to bring this game up to modern day standards, including updated visuals, music, gameplay mechanics, and several small yet welcome quality-of-life UI improvements. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG review</a> for a detailed rundown of all of the the changes and our official impressions of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Ticket to Ride is one of those timeless games that is a must-have for any <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> fan. It's celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, which makes it one of the older <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">modern classics</a> that's still in heavy rotation. The game is revered around the world. It has won major international awards, including the highly coveted <a href="https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/production-daysofwonder/uploads/2023/09/DoW_news018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiel des Jahres</a> (Game of the Year) award the year it came out, and continues to be held in high regard by gamers worldwide.</p><p>Due to its ease of play, Ticket to Ride can be played across generations, making it a great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a> to play together. It also has educational appeal because it explores multiple countries and cities in a unified way. I’ve personally used it as a tool to help my kids learn about major cities worldwide while also keeping them engaged in this fun game of train merriment. </p><p>Ticket to Ride's concept is simple enough: take your trains and connect them on routes across the board as you work towards fulfilling your own secret objectives. The game advances by collecting colored cards to use as resources for getting trains to place on your secret objective routes. You can use the color for the route shown on the board or swap out that color for a rainbow locomotive (or other rainbow-type transportation cards in other versions of the game) to help complete a route.</p><p>Each player has a set number of train tokens to pool from in hopes of placing on the game to complete their routes and score points. The game is over when someone runs out of placeable train tokens. Points are then tallied based on completed and incompleted routes and special goal objectives.</p><p>Now that you know the basics of the game, let’s examine what’s available and potentially worth buying.</p><h2>The Base Games</h2><p id="ticket-to-ride"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride">Ticket to Ride</h3></p><div catalogid="3c7163bf-8754-4902-aeb4-e449d6a7b18d" id="161110"><div id="161110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride</h3></p></div><p>Contents: destination tickets across the US, longest ride goal objective, train cars</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $54.99 USD</li><li>2-5 Players </li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>Ticket to Ride (unofficially the USA version) brings train rides across the US. This game is the easiest of the standalone games to play. Other editions add other elements that make the game more challenging (even without expansions). If you’re going to learn the base game and want it to be the easiest, this is the way to go. </p><p>Of course, after you play and go back to reality you might be disappointed that train rides across America aren’t as abundant or as fast in reality. We can dream that as our American dream someday, though, right?</p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-europe"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride Europe">Ticket to Ride Europe</h3></p><div catalogid="3f7a93b3-10b9-4400-b3d5-521434c00d53" id="206335"><div id="206335" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride Europe</h3></p></div><p>Contents: new destinations across Europe, tunnels and ferries added to the game</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $59.99 USD</li><li>2-5 Players </li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>Ticket to Ride Europe shows you the joy of traveling by train is far more abundant in other parts of the world. Travel across Europe on various trains, going across the continent and spanning multiple countries on your journey. Ticket to Ride Europe also incorporates ferries and tunnels. You’ll have to strategize a bit differently if your routes require one of those. </p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-nordic-countries-boar"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride Nordic Countries Boar">Ticket to Ride Nordic Countries</h3></p><div catalogid="a81d9a75-8a95-411f-b3ab-b33c5ab1ecec" id="206336"><div id="206336" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride Nordic Countries Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Contents: themed map, new strategy with rainbow locomotives, ferries, tunnels</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $59.00 USD</li><li>2-3 Players </li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>The Nordic Countries version of Ticket to Ride is aimed more toward smaller groups, good for sessions when you need a suitable <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board game</a>, or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three-player board game</a>. Like the European version, this version has tunnels and ferry routes. However, this version is different from the two original counterparts. In Nordic Countries, the rainbow train cards, which could be used as a wild to replace a train anywhere on the board in other versions, can only be used to replace cars used with ferries or tunnels. </p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-rails-sails"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride Rails &amp; Sails">Ticket to Ride Rails &amp; Sails</h3></p><div catalogid="85ce0e2c-77eb-49c8-8a08-8ddbdc61be5d" id="206337"><div id="206337" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride Rails &amp; Sails</h3></p></div><p>Contents: double-sided board with two different ways to play, routes across continents, tourist bonus, train cards and ship cards, harbors </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $89.99 USD</li><li>2-5 Players </li><li>90-120 minutes</li><li>Ages 10+</li></ul><p>This version of the game adds many complexities, starting with two different playable board sides. One side allows players to travel across continents, and the other has players playing across lakes. Players who take specific routes to their destinations can receive a tourist bonus. Players can also create harbors to help them get across to their destinations. At the end of the game, these harbors add big points to the people who created them. </p><p>This version of the game is the longest to play in the Ticket to Ride series. It takes double the amount of time to play it than its counterparts. This one will take a patient group for all of the added mechanics and time it takes.</p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-legacy-legends-of-th"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of Th">Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of The West</h3></p><div catalogid="9b9b5dc2-28dd-4b94-a918-97f797083cbc" id="189675"><div id="189675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of The West</h3></p></div><p>Ticket to Ride Legends of the West is the legacy version of the game, and it's good enough to land on our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">best campaign board games</a>. It is a massive undertaking that will take groups on a journey of twelve games. It’s an incredible way to experience the magic of this franchise. If you have a dedicated group, it’s worth a playthrough. After you’ve played through it once it is still playable afterwards, but some of its allure and mystique will vanish as is the case of many legacy-type games. </p><h2>Kids Versions</h2><p>Even though I think the original versions and several iterations are already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">kid-friendly board games</a>, three versions are specifically catered to kids and are available for folks to enjoy. These games take half the time as the other versions and have simpler rules.</p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-first-journey"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride: First Journey">Ticket to Ride: First Journey</h3></p><div catalogid="838c1139-1aaa-4614-8bf8-a0a00f0f0748" id="206339"><div id="206339" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride: First Journey</h3></p></div><p>Contents: Simplified American map with shorter routes, Golden ticket challenge</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $34.99 USD</li><li>2-4 Players </li><li>15-30 minutes</li><li>Ages 6+</li></ul><p>Take the Ticket to Ride (USA) version and make it even simpler and shorter, and you have First Journey.

(Come on Days of Wonder, you can make adults a version like this for us, too.) This one offers a quirky spooky theme to the game changing not only the destinations and the board but the transport route too. Like the other two kids versions, this one goes by quicker too which is good for kids and adults alike who want a shorter gameplay experience of the franchise of games. I used this game to teach some beginner friends how to play other versions of the base game in my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-paris-board-game-review">review of Ticket to Ride Paris</a>.</p><h2>Ticket to Ride Expansions</h2><p>A couple of different expansions can be added to some of the base games. They are about half the cost of the original game they go with, and they give you another fresh set of the original cards in addition to some new ones and variations on how to play the base games they are connected to. If you have played the base games multiple times already and are looking to spice things up, these two expansion add-ons are worth considering. </p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-usa-1910-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 Expansion">Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="d7612878-8dd1-48f0-8f07-c1378bcc0dd9" id="206342"><div id="206342" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 Expansion</h3></p></div><p>Contents: 33 new destination tickets, a Globetrotter bonus card for finishing the most tickets, new rules variants </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $21.99 USD</li><li>2-5 Players </li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p>Note: This expansion is not a stand-alone game.

The expansion adds ways to play what they call Big Cities Of Europe, Europe Expanded, and Mega Europe. Each of those will have different objectives and rules.</p><h2>Map Collections</h2><p>Map Collections are stand-alone maps which allow you to play around a city. Map games may use different types of transportation outside of trains, depending on their area's popular transit modes. There are a lot of them to choose from!</p><p>The map collections are fun, focusing on different, often more hyperlocal areas. However, their packaging can also be a bit confusing. </p><p>While you can buy some map destinations independently, some game versions have two area maps in the box. The pairing doesn’t always make sense. For example, the map of Japan also includes an Italian map. The United Kingdom also includes a Pennsylvania map. If it sounds confusing to you, you’re not alone. I am still scratching my head about it to an extent myself.</p><p><strong>Ticket to Ride cities</strong>:<a href="https://zdcs.link/rdk0m?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Paris</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRx4Y?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amsterdam</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMYyY?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">London</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/dMArK?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/BdNYM?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">San Francisco</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/MVEq1?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Berlin</a></p><p><strong>Ticket to Ride maps</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdvyp?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Asia</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0j14?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Heart of Africa</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/PyJXy?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Poland</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/eB0lw?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Berlin</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/XD3oW?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nederland</a></p><p><strong>Games that have multiple versions in the same box</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/pgMrY?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japan</a> (contains Japan and Italy) | <a href="https://zdcs.link/nodVD?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">United Kingdom</a> (contains the United Kingdom and Pennsylvania) | <a href="https://zdcs.link/KJVZB?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">France</a> (contains Ticket to Ride France and Old West) | Japan (contains Ticket to Ride Japan and Ticket to Ride Italy) | <a href="https://zdcs.link/3d7w2?object_uuid=4f05ccdb-f231-43dc-93b0-597f28be6474&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">India</a> (contains Ticket to Ride India and Switzerland), </p><h2>More Ways to Play</h2><p>There are several ways to play Ticket to Ride Digitally. Here are three different ones you can experience a few editions of the game you can currently play in digital form. </p><p>A note before going into these is that the current Steam version of the game is different from another that might be seen on Steam but is no longer available for download. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108200/Ticket_to_Ride_Classic_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: Classic Edition</a>, developed by Days of Wonder (the board game company that created the physical game) and Twin Sails Interactive, was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/108200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discontinued in September of 2023</a>. Players who bought it but hadn’t already downloaded it before October 2nd 2023, were also unable to download or install it even if they already owned it.</p><p>Ticket to Ride Classic Edition included several different expansions that are not currently available in the newest iteration. All online play of the game was removed. Folks who already own the game and its expansions can still play the game on their own accord on their computers with asynchronous play if they wish. The game being discontinued in this way <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3163124/appsteam-versions-being-discontinued" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caused an uproar of frustration from many players who had the Classic Edition of the game</a>. I personally am frustrated for not having gotten the previous edition of the game. My brother did and even had a copy he could have gifted me with the expansions (one of which was Japan which is a cool one, in my opinion), but we were unable to do so due to this change. </p><p>The below version is a newer and completely different version, which I can attest is quite enjoyable regardless of the Classic Edition not being an option for most folks anymore.</p></div><p id="ticket-to-ride-on-steam"><h3 data-toc-title="Ticket to Ride on Steam">Ticket to Ride on Steam</h3></p><div catalogid="d97c4134-f2c2-4338-ae5c-0beffdec23d7" id="206407"><div id="206407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride (Steam)</h3></p></div><p>The newest version of the digital version is done by Marmalade Studios. A digital version of Ticket to Ride's base game on Steam costs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477010/Ticket_to_Ride/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$14.99</a>, and an expansion called Ticket to Ride-Round the World Ticket is available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608230/Ticket_to_Ride__Round_the_World_Ticket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$34.00</a>. There are also a few expansion packs that include individual expansion portions of the game if you are not interested in getting the Round the World Ticket pack. You can buy the Nordic Expansion for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856300/Ticket_to_Ride__Nordic_Expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$7.99</a>. The Europe Expansion is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608220/Ticket_to_Ride__Europe_Expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$9.99</a>. Ticket to Ride USA 1910 Ticket Pack expansion is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2938560/Ticket_to_Ride__USA_1910_Ticket_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.99</a>. Ticket to Ride- India Expansion is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2938570/Ticket_to_Ride__India_Expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$7.99</a>.</p><p>I have played the new Ticket to Ride and its World Ticket expansion and found them to be quite fun. As stated above, the Ride Around the World Ticket opens several different expansions to the mix, including the USA 1910 Ticket Pack, Europe Expansion, Nordic Countries, and their newest map: India. They released an India expansion in June. The system itself looks great even though some bugs are still in the game occasionally. I found placing trains to be a bit difficult to do at times on my computer. I also had an issue where when I was initially installing the game on my computer, it didn’t work until I had a physical mouse vs. just my laptop’s trackpad. Those issues were admittedly a bit frustrating and hopefully will be worked on more as time progresses because, as I mentioned, the game is otherwise done fairly well.</p><p>You can play the digital versions single-player versus AI, online against other players around the world, pass and play (trading off turns on a single device for folks playing games on a physical train or other form of transport, for example), and asynchronously. I’ve played a majority of my games vs AI on my phone and my computer. I have primarily enjoyed the experience, minus a few times when placing trains was a bit wonky with controls. In particular, I enjoyed the newer editions of maps they’ve added. I look forward to seeing more of the ones that aren’t there yet.</p><p>Playing the game will also provide progression on a leaderboard that ranks players for individual “seasons” about a month in length. This can add another layer for folks who want to be competitive with others, whether they are competing for single-player rankings or online rankings. The leaderboard will also show statistics and Hall of Fame results, which can give players a better idea of how they’ve done throughout a “season.”</p><p>The community around the game in this iteration is also very positive. They have an online community Discord server that encourages players to connect and share their positive experiences, report bugs, and collaborate with gaming events. I found that experience to be a really nice edition to this game personally. </p><h3>Board Game Arena</h3><p>My digital gaming group has played both the base game of <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=tickettoride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride</a> and <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=tickettorideeurope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride Europe</a> on Board Game Arena. The versions we’ve played over there have been very user-friendly in their interface. You can play both versions on Board Game Arena if one person in your board game group has a premium subscription to the site.  We are currently playing Ticket to Ride Europe, and if you’re in my board game group, I swear I will take my turn after I’m done writing this!</p><p>Board Game Arena premium costs $3 a month or $36 a year. You’re billed upfront for the year when you go premium, and you'll have access to both editions of Ticket to Ride.  </p><h3>Tabletop Simulator</h3></div><div catalogid="cc7d2ba4-bd21-4f58-a944-0ac252cb6d58" id="206408"><div id="206408" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tabletop Simulator</h3></p></div><p>Tabletop Simulator has three versions of Ticket to Ride available: the original, Ticket to Ride London, and Ticket to Ride Japan. These games do not have scripting, so they play differently to an extent. Tabletop Simulator is a physics-based virtual gaming simulator. Some games have scripting, which helps newer gamers with gameplay. Unfortunately, since the versions of Tabletop Simulator are not available to be played with scripting, it’s not recommended to play these versions unless you know someone familiar with the game already and familiar with physics-simulated style games.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Ticket to Ride is a timeless, award-winning franchise of board games that players across generations can enjoy. The core two versions of USA and Europe are solid games to add to your collection. However, multiple other maps are also available in the collection, as several introduce new concepts and layers to enhance the experience. The Ghost Train variant, while a kid's version, also may appeal to fans of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror board games</a> regardless of age.</p><p>For the most part, outside of the kid's games, these games take a bit more time to complete, whether you are doing the games virtually or in person. Ticket to Ride’s USA digital version on BGA was the longest game for my personal digital board game group to complete last year. It’s become a bit of an ongoing joke, considering how long it took to complete. While I’m excited about Rails and Sails, I am admittedly a bit nervous about how much longer it would take to play if a digital version ever became available, let alone a sit-down game in real life. That version is also significantly more expensive than the other maps. I’d recommend several other available maps to explore if your group has limited time and wants to change up your experience.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

            <p>
Balatro, the acclaimed poker-themed rogue-like that continues to haunt my dreams, has just released a free update for PC and consoles introducing a bunch of cosmetic cameos from the likes of The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>.
</p>
<p>
Balatro's Friends of Jimbo update, as it's officially known, is available now and gives player the option to swap out the game's usual Kings, Queens, and Jacks with characters from the aforementioned series. So if you'd like to spice up a run with a beaming Jaskier or a vampire from the infamously vampire-free Vampire Survivors, today's your lucky day.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379780/view/4275691671073449544?l=english">post shared on Steam</a>, developer LocalThunk explained Friends of Jimbo is the second of three big Balatro announcements due this summer, with the first being the recent news of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">free major gameplay update</a> - promising "new ideas and strategies" - that's currently due next year.

As to what the final reveal in LocalThunk's "Three-of-a-Kind of Surprises" campaign will be, that remains to be seen, but expect the announcement to happen before September concludes.
</p>
<p>
And if you've yet to play Balatro, Christian Donlan had good things to say about its rogue-like spin on poker in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">four star review</a> earlier this year, calling it, "So striking and so brilliantly constructed, and something that has given me such pleasure for the last week".

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, Blizzard showcased Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, the first of a series of expansions coming to the action RPG with a scheduled annual cadence.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-is-the-first-expansion-due-in-late-2024-will-add-brand-new-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> during the BlizzCon 2023 Opening Ceremony, Vessel of Hatred is set to add the Spiritborn class, which is brand new to the Diablo franchise. You can check it out in action in our gameplay capture video available below.</p>
<p>During the German convention, I had the chance to interview Game Director Brent Gibson and Systems Designer Aislyn Hall to discuss not only Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred but also the future of the live service game at length. Here's the full transcript of our chat. As a reminder, the expansion is out on October 8 on all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Gamescom 4K Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItkbOwx5XQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>To start off, which feature from Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred do you think is most important for the future of the game since you plan to support it for years to come?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> The most important new feature, well, we're adding new ways to play, we're adding new forms of power. I think Mercenaries is going to have a really big impact on gameplay. Not only is it going to give players who like to play solo a small taste of playing in a party, where they can take the weaknesses of their class build and supplement it with a follower that comes along, but they can also use this whole new feature that we have called reinforcements.</p>
<p>With this one, you can take a mercenary and slot them into come into the fight for a moment, pull off the power of me. The cool thing about that is that you can actually define the condition, like, my health is getting low, come in and tank some of my damage, for example. It essentially starts to address the feedback that people want more skills and abilities on their bar. Now you can actually use reinforcement as kind of an additional ability that you normally wouldn't have.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall:</strong> Another feature in Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred that I think is really important and is going to have an impact further on is the Kurast Undercity. It's really important in a game like Diablo that there are a lot of different activities that you can participate in, a lot of different activities that are relevant to the endgame. The Kurast Undercity is going to be a time attack mode where you have to go quickly through a dungeon. It also has a tribute system that allows you to search for specific kinds of gear that your character specifically needs right now. So, with those two things combined, I think having just a different way to play, combined with the specific rewards that it gives you, is going to be a really, really important thing.</p>
<p><strong>With the addition of Mercenaries, did you have to balance the whole game a bit differently because people can now have these companions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> Yeah, every time we add a new source of power, we have to balance it against everything else. Not only are we adding a new class that has to be balanced against everything, but then we also have the Mercenaries system that has to be balanced in such as well. We're making a bunch of changes in the game from the progression system that allows us to have a more sustainable way of looking at the balance across the game, and the difficulty across the game, and being able to add new ways to earn new sources of power without breaking everything.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, there are going to be some major progression updates similar in scope to Season 4 Loot Reborn with how itemization was fundamentally altered there. Russian season 640B is to be really improved upon as well, and so we're basically using that philosophically as an opportunity to lay the foundations of Diablo IV for years to come to ensure that when we're adding features like Mercenaries or other sources of power to the game, that the game is going to remain in a healthy state where players can always face a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Do the Mercenaries only work in the open world?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> They work in dungeons as well. They're always with you in some form and you have a lot of control over how they come along with you.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, if you have a full party of players, you can't use them, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> That's where the Reinforcement system comes in. If you have a full party, you can still use your Reinforcement. I can set up Raheir, who gives me advantages to taking damage, and then I can also have Varyana, who gives me advantages to attack speed, and I can have that combination. You might be using a fire build, in which case you'll want to bring Aldkin around because he can do a lot of fire damage if you spec them that way, and so he can actually amplify your fire build. There's a lot of different ways to mix and match.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>The Reinforcements are like a separate concept from the Mercenaries themselves in the sense that you can have your Reinforcement regardless of how many people are in your party, like Brent said. Even if you're in a full party of players, you'll still have your reinforcement, and the reinforcement will use an ability based on what you decide when you want them to use it. There are a lot of different triggers that you can set, so it can be whenever you reach low health, then perhaps you can set them to use a defensive ability. Or you could set it so that when you use a big AoE attack, they can use an ability that might pull everyone in, so there are a lot of synergies.</p>

<p><strong>I know that Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred is also adding a multiplayer dungeon. Did that desire come internally, or was it more community feedback that you got?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> The excitement around doing more cooperative gameplay definitely came internally, but we also saw that our player base that likes to play socially has been growing, right? So we want to make sure that when we're adding new content to the game it is going to really reflect the type of people who are playing our game. We introduced a new cooperative PvE dungeon that has cooperative mechanics built into it, but the core gameplay is still that Diablo combat and it's just one way to challenge players who'd like to play together in the endgame. It was a little bit of both. We knew that we wanted to grow that player base, and it was actually happening, and so it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>A big part of the philosophy behind a lot of systems in Vessel of Hatred is that we want to ensure that what we're creating is really, really fun to do, either by yourself or in a group and doing it cooperatively. That ties into the progression changes that are coming, it ties into the Kurast Citadel, and it really is amplified across the entire game. We want to ensure that Vessel of Hatred is the best time to play Diablo IV.</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I'm a fan of MMOs. I've played World of Warcraft for a long time, so multiplayer dungeons are definitely something I'd like to see more. Actually, in a pre-release interview we did remotely, I asked if you would consider more defined player roles, like tank or support. Is that something you're talking about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>We definitely talk a lot about it. World of Warcraft has the Holy Trinity, you know, tank, DPS, and healer. Diablo IV is not quite that type of game. When we look at the when it comes to the rules and a cooperative thing. It's more about the activity, and so when we talk about cooperative mechanics, anybody can play any role, and the activity is just calling for a different type of interaction from those worlds. You've probably seen this in other games, but the focus is on the activity, not necessarily the class.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>It is something that I know the team is fully aware of in the sense that we know from previous Diablo had some builds for support focused characters, and more team oriented skills creating opportunities for that is definitely something the team is aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, you're adding the Spiritborn class. Whenever you add a new class to a game, for example, going back to World of Warcraft, when the Death Knight landed, it was by far the most popular class, and the other players that stick with the old classes feel a bit diminished for a while. So, what are you doing to make the other players using existing classes feel as powerful and cool as the Spiritborn?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>There's a couple of things. First off, every single class is going to get some update. They're going to get new skills, they're going to get changes to the progression. We will be releasing new items for the classes, so there's a lot to go on for those players who main a Barbarian, for example. They'll have changes where they can really dig in and do some really cool stuff. There's some more conversations that we'll have in our live stream about some of the upcoming progression changes that will help with that, but it's such a fundamental change that I think every player is going to have more than enough content to deal with. As for the Spiritborn, it's brand new and there's nothing we can do about that.</p>
<p>Actually, we're very excited about that, but one of the things you're going to see with the Spiritborn itself is that there are a lot of elements. Each Spirit Guardian that you can spec into has a different fighting style built in. If you're a Barbarian main, the Jaguar has some things that help you lean in that direction and customize it even beyond that. The hybridization is the thing that I think is really exciting. I think everybody who has a favorite class today will have something to experiment with in that regard, so I'd highly recommend giving it a try.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the story content included with Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, can you share how many hours of new gameplay players can expect on average?</strong></p>
<p>That is tough because it depends on the type of player. Some people skip all the cutscenes. There's the player who likes to kill every monster. There's the player who skips all the encounters to go straight to the bosses. There's so many different play styles. But this is a rich story, and if you sit down and you really enjoy it... It is a healthy next chapter to the game. Unfortunately, I can't put a number on it because I don't know what type of player will be reading in this article.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>The story of Vessel of Hatred is a direct continuation of the story from the original game, and I think you can expect the same degree of care and detail that went into the original campaign story.</p>
<p><strong>So, it's a bit like a new Act.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Yeah. It shares a lot of the same philosophies as what you saw in the base game. There's a certain amount of story that we want to be able to tell because we're learning about what the fate of the Soulstone is, so there's a lot of work that has to go into that. We're super proud of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Are there more itemization layers coming with the expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Nothing to announce today, but you're definitely going to want to stay tuned to our next couple of live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, we're going to have a campfire chat on August 29th, and we'll go over many details about the systemic changes coming.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The Armory isn't available at launch, but it's top of the list. However, there are no plans for an Auction House.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay. Is there any news on Armory or Loadouts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>The Armory is at the top of the list of things we're considering, and we are trying to figure out the best way to bring a feature like that to the table. It's not at the launch of Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, but it is at the top of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Bigger stash?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Everybody loves to talk about the stash! Actually, I don't believe we have anything to announce today on the stash. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>You're adding a Party Finder with the update, correct?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>Yes. Party Finder is a huge addition that we really feel is important to have for something like the Dark Citadel, because it's cooperative. I play with my friends, but sometimes they can't be online, so we need to have that. But it is something that applies to all activities in the game, and it is going to be available to everybody, regardless of Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other social features coming with the expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I think the biggest new social feature is our Party Finder.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Party Finder is a huge addition that we really feel is important to have for something like the Dark Citadel, because it's cooperative. But it is something that applies to all activities in the game, and it is going to be available to everybody, regardless of Vessel of Hatred.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>A lot of players ask about adding an Auction House.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>The great debate. There's no plan for an Auction House at this time.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen to our level 100 characters in the Eternal Realm, in case the cap is 60?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I would stay tuned for the progression discussion on August 29, but we're taking into account everybody coming in at every single level coming into Vessel of Hatred. The user experience is definitely going to be custom-tailored to make sure that everybody feels great.</p>
<p><strong>On a personal note, I wanted to add that I'm not a big fan of creating new characters every season. Especially early on, right after the game was released, it kind of felt like the Eternal Realm was a bit left behind.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>I've heard that feedback a lot. One of the things that you notice more often is our seasonal content is going to Eternal. We want to make sure that the Eternal players and the seasonal players are getting the same amount of fun. Now, we have a huge seasonal community that absolutely loves renewing, and we have a huge Eternal community, so we're going to continue to look at how we bring those two communities together.</p>
<p>You'll see that in seasons, obviously, and then there's other things like the progression changes that we're talking about. Everybody's going to get that. So if you are an Eternal player, you're going to get an extension of the campaign, you're going to get a new area to explore and unlock content, there's new dungeons, there's new gameplay modes, all that stuff is coming for the Eternal characters.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Out of all the updates that have come to Diablo IV so far, Vessel of Hatred is going to be the one with the most amount of new things that are coming to the Eternal Realm. As Brent said, we're going to continue to do our best to include as much as possible in seasons to the Eternal Realm.</p>
<p><strong>Are you looking into tweaking the difficulty curve early on? Some players say it's a bit too easy while you're leveling up until endgame.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>When we talk about fundamental changes to the progression system, we want the difficulty to feel smoother, and we'll want more player agency there, so it's definitely something we've been investing into.</p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall: </strong>Yeah, we have a philosophy that we have been utilizing with these major progression things that are coming, where we want to ensure that it's in the player's hands what kind of challenge they want to face and ensuring that you could tune the game's experience in any content, from the early game all the way to the very late game. That's a big guiding North Star for us with these changes coming in season 6.</p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson: </strong>And a good example, you've talked about this in the past, is all the feedback we've been getting from the Profane Mindcage. We know that players are trying to use something like the Profane Mindcage to influence the difficulty, and we don't want a consumable to play that role, so we are looking to make some changes.</p>
<p><strong>What's your number one favorite feature in Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aislyn Hall:</strong> I really like the Dark Citadel. I ran through it a few weeks ago and it was just so exciting to go through and basically figure out the mechanics and have that feeling of overcoming a significant challenge with my friends. I really love that and we also get some pretty juicy rewards from it that we can cash every week. So, doing it every week once Vessel of Hatred launches is definitely going to be something fun.</p>
<p><strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Gibson:</strong> I'm gonna talk about the Spiritborn class. The playstyle, the rhythm, and the flow of this class really speak to my playstyle, so I'd have to say I'm really excited about the class.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is extremely healthy right now. I actually think our interaction with the media, the content creators, with our fans, we've been pouring a ton of energy into reaching out and getting the feedback and listening. The state of Diablo is the healthiest I think it's been since launch.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Earlier, you said there is a big Eternal community and a big seasonal community. Talking about the size of the Diablo IV community, is it healthy, especially after the Game Pass <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, you know. Being on Game Pass is one of those things that we looked forward to the most, with the idea that we get out to as many players as possible. Diablo is a community that has a lot of folks that have been around since the first one, but something like Game Pass is also introducing the franchise to a bunch of newcomers. So, it is extremely healthy right now. I actually think our interaction with the media, the content creators, with our fans, we've been pouring a ton of energy into reaching out and getting the feedback and listening. The state of Diablo is the healthiest I think it's been since launch, and I'm super proud of it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

The first of two SNK characters coming during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-m-bison-terry-elena-mai-season-2-1851527248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-m-bison-terry-elena-mai-season-2-1851527248"><em>SF6</em>’s second season</a></span> (the other being Mai Shiranui), Terry appears to be landing with some force. <em>SF6 </em>adapts essentially the entirety of his iconic moveset, including his earth-shattering Power Wave punch, his gravity-defying Rising Tackle—where he spins like a top while he shoots up through the air feet first— and his searing Burning Knuckle. While I’ve only got a passing familiarity with Terry and the <em>Fatal Fury </em>series, I know him well enough to know that <em>SF6 </em>has done a wonderful job bringing these moves forward.</p><p>The reverence doesn’t stop there. Terry sports some of his signature looks, including the red jacket he’s most known for wearing, as well as a brown jacket from <em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>. Depending on the fit he’s got on, he’ll even do different intro and winning animations, including a callback to Terry’s cap-throwing victory pose from the SNK games. In a game already bursting at the seams with love for its own legendary roster, it’s pretty great that <em>SF6 </em>rolls out the red carpet for Terry.</p><p>With the obvious caveat that <strong>I</strong> <strong>don’t really play fighting games all that regularly</strong>, Terry felt great in <em>SF6 </em>during my recent hands-on with the character<em>. </em>His Power Wave allows him to make some space for himself, while moves like Burning Knuckle and his Crack Shoot kick, where Terry flips forward and brings his leg down on his enemy, allow him to bridge sizable gaps and deal a ton of damage. Some characters are grapplers, others are great at mixups and such, and Terry strikes me as a great all-around character. He may not have a box you can fit him neatly into, but in the right hands, I’m sure he’ll be a menace and his inclusion in this game is exciting as hell.</p><p>On another note, I kind of suck at fighting games, and love ones that provide more tools for me to get better. I want to learn to be able to better appreciate the nuances between Terry and the rest of the <em>SF6 </em>roster. Training modes are a given for this, but <em>SF6 </em>is going the extra mile with two really neat new features that should help players (like me!) get better and feel more comfortable competing in Ranked lobbies. The first is a feature the team is calling Replay Review. More than just some glorified replay function, this new tool allows you to playback a match and then <em>take control </em>of one of the combatants in the recording. If you thought you got completely owned by a player who was using Manon in a way you’ve never seen before, you can review the match, study their movements, and then jump back into control of yourself to try your own strategies against them.</p><p>It’s a wild new tool that I’ve never heard of before—though it does seem to have been featured in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-review-roundup-1851189539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-review-roundup-1851189539"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></span>—and it was utterly seamless in action. After whooping my opponent (sorry, bud) he took the opportunity to use the new function to see what I’d done to win. Upon taking control of his own character again, he implemented techniques he’d learned over the course of the fight to see if he could’ve squeezed me for more damage or cornered me in a different way. My own fighter was echoing the moves that I’d made in the fight, which even gave me time to critique my own playstyle. I’ve since learned that I jump in too much, and that’s probably what leaves me so vulnerable to punishes and anti-air techniques. We all took something valuable away from this cool new feature.</p><p>I expect a lot of pro players are going to be using this on the circuit to more closely review both their wins and losses, and to formalize their strategies. It’s great that it has use cases for players on either end of the spectrum though, since casual players can use the same tool to <em>begin </em>forming strategies and catalyzing winning playstyles. This great new feature will be rolling out with Terry’s addition on September 24.</p><p>Another feature that was mentioned was the introduction of a mode called V-Rivals. In it, players can pick a rank for an AI opponent based on the hierarchy found in <em>SF6</em>’s online Ranked competitions. The opponent will aggregate the playstyles of people found in that rank and then face off against the player in a form of training. Players are intended to play more or less around their rank or just above it in order to learn to climb the ladder, and the feature is primarily built for newcomers who are hesitant to jump into Ranked play. This way, players can grow more comfortable competing without sacrificing their status in online matches.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get to play this new mode as our preview site lacked the ability to connect to the network, but in theory, V-Rivals (which will launch alongside everything else in September) sounds like a great tool for someone like me. Playing in <em>SF6’s </em>preview window was humbling and I got my ass handed to me by <em>countless </em>friends of mine. Though it’s just the nature of competition, fighting games, with their 1v1 matchups, are among the most intimate online settings, making loss a deeply embarrassing experience.

<p>The PUBG Nations Cup 2024 (PNC) is underway, with the tournament series beginning in just under two weeks. Here is everything we know about the tournament, including its prize pool, schedule and where to watch.</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-nations-cup-2024-schedule">PUBG Nations Cup 2024 Schedule</h2>



<p>With some of the best PUBG: Battlegrounds teams in the world competing in the PUBG Nations Cup this year, fans are expecting some intense action. The tournament has had various qualifiers over the last few months, with 16 different countries being represented in the competition, competitors are gearing up to head to Seoul, South Korea for the Grand Finals.</p>



<h4 id="h-schedule">Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Start Date:</strong>&nbsp;September 6, 2024</li>



<li><strong>End Date:</strong>&nbsp;September 8, 2024</li>
</ul>



<p>The event will be held at KyungHee Grand Peace Hall in Seoul, South Korea.</p>







<h2 id="h-pubg-nations-cup-2024-prize-pool">PUBG Nations Cup 2024 Prize Pool</h2>



<p>The popular championship will feature a $300,000 prize pool, but there is a catch. The prize pool will be an evolving one, meaning it will grow by incorporating 30% of PNC skin sales. Depending on how dedicated the fans are, we could see a much higher prize pool at the PUBG Nations Cup. </p>

<p>The dwarves of J.R.R. Tolkien's writing are, according to the author himself, "a tough, thrawn race for the most part, secretive, retentive of the memory of injuries (and of benefits)," and "lovers… of things that take shape under the hands of the craftsmen rather than things that live by their own life."</p>
<p>Is it secrecy and avarice that explains why <em>The Lord of the Rings: </em><em>Return to Moria</em> spent its first year of existence as an exclusive to the Epic Games Store? None can say for certain. But the survival crafting game has today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/">arrived on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/9n96t1s3l9sb">Xbox</a>, adding to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDBaYWE2Nm9NNkRWM2lVVUQ4NXJ5ZW5WS3ZRQXxBQ3Jtc0tscEd2RVI1UnRkdTFEN2dLT3gxUUExQklCUEhuYVJWSHpST0xTeEpWeGtTbGR3TE1VMXpUZmtUVlczYnkwVlJEUm9pTzJSMkZqNUxDbWdwMGItaHlUSS1YckQ5ejlHdVBzMERaZVZEdXEwczJUc256bw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.playstation.com%2Fconcept..&amp;v=cnt7N3H49IE">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-f01344">EGS</a> platforms and bringing a 1.3 "Golden Update" to them all. Steam Deck compatibility is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/4241914673865774571?l=english">on its way to Verified</a>, with a bunch of handheld niceties already in place.</p>
<p>The Golden Update grants new and existing players a procedurally generated sandbox mode to complement the game's (also generated) campaign, new weapons and armor, crossplay between all platforms with up to eight players, specific sliders for difficulty settings, and… a pause function in offline single-player, which seemingly was not there before.</p>

<p>What are you actually&nbsp;<em>doing</em> in&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria</em>? You, a dwarf in the Fourth Age of Middle-Earth, are tasked by Gimli Lockbearer with heading into Moria (i.e. Khazad-dûm) to recover its treasures. Except every Moria is different, generated from random generation seeds. You mine for materials, use materials to make gear and goods, set up base camps with stations and fixtures, and, of course, fight the things you awaken in the depths.</p>

<p>Not only does a release on new cross-compatible platforms give you a chance to check out a potentially overlooked gem, but this is also version 1.3 of the game. Reviews of the game at release in October 2023 were closely aligned around one point: it needed more time to cook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review/">PC Gamer</a> found the game authentic to Tolkien's lore, intriguing in its depictions of underground spaces, and alternately goofy and harrowing in building and fighting. But bugs, stuttering, clipping errors, and disbelief-shattering oddities brought the experience down a good deal.&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em> was more critical of the game's tile-based layouts and laborious backtracking. "A few patches could see this become a survival game that can hold its own against the more popular entries in the genre," wrote Ford James.</p>
<p>In a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIZ3f5cL6l0&amp;t=33s">Quality of Life Showcase</a>," Game Director Jon-Paul Dumont details how the game has advanced over the past 10 months. The map is color-coded and easier to read, the ambient music and transitions are improved, combat improvements make it feel better and more grounded (another point of review contention), and player gripes about inventory management, cooking, building, and crafting have been tackled.</p>
<p>I haven't played enough of the game to render any kind of verdict on it, but I'm always eager to see the work of a team actively fixing after launch—digging in, if you will.</p>

		<p>Staff at development studio Spiders, developers of Greedfall and Steerlrising, have released an open letter to state they will be going on strike next week. The reasons for the strike action include management ignoring staff requests, pay disparity based on gender, high turnover, and poor employee support. In addition, staff have stated that the environment had led to problems on the development of Greedfall 2 and another, yet to be announced project.</p>
<p>The letter from the Spiders team, which can be read below, has been published by STJV, an independent French union which represents people working in the videogames industry.</p>


<p><em>This letter to our management follows an earlier open letter and a strike on January 19, which management has chosen not to ignore. Since then, new negotiations have begun on wages, and conditions in the studio have continued to deteriorate. Today, it is with regret that we speak out publicly, in the hope that this will finally push management to act in the best interests of employees and the company.</em></p>
<p><em>This document covers several years of known problems, which have been greatly amplified over the past year with the arrival of the current head of the company : instability, opposition to anticipating problems and securing working conditions, global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations.</em></p>
<p><em>As of August 27, 2024, this letter has been signed by 44 workers at Spiders, out of 95.</em></p>

<p><em>We had demanded that the head of the company receive a delegation of Spiders’ workers to discuss all these points. She accepted, the delegation came to a meeting on August 27 and then waited in vain for the management to come, which it never did.</em></p>
<h2><em>Call for strike action during the week of September 2</em></h2>
<p><em>In light of management’s continued refusal to discuss, take the problems raised seriously and act to rectify them,&nbsp;we are calling on Spiders workers to go on strike during the week of September 2, 2024, on the basis of the demands set out above.</em></p>
<p><em>In particular, we will be organizing&nbsp;pickets on September 2 and 3 in front of the company’s offices and online on a Minecraft server&nbsp;created for the occasion.</em></p>
<p><em>We are inviting our relatives, friends, supporters, workers in the industry in general, journalists and political actors to join us at the pickets.</em></p>
<p><em>To help us strike, and if you have the means to do so, you can make a donation to the STJV strike fund, which has been activated for this strike at the request of the STJV section.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/stjv-strike-fund/">Instructions on how to donate can be found on this page</a>. Don’t hesitate to specify “Spiders” in the reference of your transfer. We’ll keep track of the sums paid to workers.</em></p>
<p><em>Workers at Spiders face many difficulties:</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>GROWING INSTABILITY</b>, because it is impossible for us to: know where we will be able to live in the future, know whether we will be able to have a fulfilling personal life, anticipate our long-term evolution at Spiders. But also because of low wages and a lack of certainty about increases over the next few years.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>A COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO ANTICIPATING PROBLEMS AND SECURING WORKING CONDITIONS</b>&nbsp;due to : an ideological stance held by the company’s management and its refusal to acknowledge issues, the rolling back, for no good reason, of arrangements that had been in place for years, as well as rising pressure on the workers’ shoulders.</em></p>
<p><em>►<b>&nbsp;GLOBAL MISMANAGEMENT:&nbsp;</b>the studio tripling in size in 3 years and the launch of two lines of production side-by-side were, in all likelihood, not anticipated or planned for by the company. Its structure has evolved very little, if at all.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>GROWING TURNOVER AND RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS:</b>&nbsp;many veteran workers are leaving the company. In response, the company is making little efforts to try and retain them, to find suitable in-house successors, or to make the company attractive to hiring prospects.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN ACHIEVING GENDER EQUALITY AND PARITY:</b>&nbsp;the gender balance at Spiders remains well below the already low industry average, and women employee’s average wage is considerably lower than men’s.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>A BLATANT LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY:</b>&nbsp;its management, budgets, plannings, financial health, working conditions… The company’s strategy remains unknown, no explanation is given for decisions imposed, and their source is often hidden from us.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>PROBLEMS ARE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, AND THEIR VERY EXISTENCE DENIED:</b>&nbsp;despite having been brought up with management for years through every possible channel, problems are either ignored or worse, their very existence is outright denied and questioned.</em></p>
<p><em>►<b>&nbsp;A DIFFICULT PRODUCTION CYCLE FOR GREEDFALL 2:&nbsp;</b>as a direct consequence of these problems, there is widespread anxiety and a loss of interest among employees. For many, it translates into a fear of releasing a disappointing game at the end and/or a feeling of shame over their own work. For some, it’s the last straw that pushes them to look for work elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>MANAGEMENT’S ADAMANT REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE COLLECTIVE ACTION:&nbsp;</b>at the slightest opportunity, management is reducing everything to confidential individual negotiation, accentuating inequalities between workers and paving the way for discrimination and abuse.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>MANAGEMENT’S SENSELESS REFUSAL TO ACCEPT WORKER REPRESENTATION:&nbsp;</b>they challenge and belittle the legitimacy of staff representatives and collective expression in any shape or form, while also refusing to consult workers themselves.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>NEGOTIATIONS WITH NO POSSIBLE COMPROMISES:&nbsp;</b>the mission of workers’ representatives, as well as negotiations on wages and work from home, are impeded by the management’s infantilizing contempt for workers and its refusal to enforce its obligations, particularly when it comes to sharing information.</em></p>
<p>A much longer and detailed letter has also been published by STJV, and t<a href="https://www.stjv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Open-letter-to-Spiders-management-public-version.pdf">hat letter can be accessed at this link</a>. Spiders has been contacted for comment about the upcoming strike, and we will publish the studio’s response if and when we receive one.</p>

<div>



<div>
<div><p>Today, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> went live. The campaign is to produce new expansions for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Old Gods of Appalachia</em> TTRPG</a>, which was successfully crowdfunded on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-backed-in-11-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter last year</a>. Like that initial campaign, this campaign was fully funded on day one, doubling its initial funding goal.</p>

<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> will produce three new books for the Old Gods of Appalachia TTRPG. In addition, the campaign provides new licensed accessories as add-ons.</p>

It is a supplement with new player options, including new foci, backgrounds, equipment, and player intrusions. <em>All Your Gods Are Dead</em> is a GM supplement filled with new NPCs, cyphers, and artifacts. The third book is <em>Come Hell Or High Water</em>, a prewritten adventure book.</p>
<p>For hardcore fans, <em>Come Hell or High Water</em> will include new material on various sites from the original podcast. One of these sites are the Walker House, which was the focus of the show's inaugural story. This new material is personally written by co-creators Steve Shell and Cam Collins.</p>
<p>The add-ons in the <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> campaign are few but enticing. In addition to a new Resource Deck to help speed up play, there are paper props, a light-up witch jar, licensed t-shirts and hats, and a dice set with a tin branded by the Barrow &amp; Locke Mining Company.</p>
<p>The different pledge levels for <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Shadows At The Threshold for $40:</strong> A physical book and PDF of either <em>Dig Your Own Grave</em>, <em>All Your Gods Are Dead</em>, or <em>Come Hell or High Water</em></li>
<li><strong>Echoes From The Dark for $110:</strong> PDFs and physical copies of all three supplements</li>
<li><strong>Into The Whispering Deep for $180:</strong> Physical copies and PDFS of all three supplements, Resource Deck 2, Prop Set, and dice set with tin.</li>
<li><strong>The Darkness Stares Back for $290:</strong> Everything in the Into The Whispering Deep level, a Jack's Fate Pendant, Witch Jar, a <em>Deeper Still</em> T-Shirt, and baseball cap.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> campaign has raised $238,962, more than double its initial funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends September 20.</p>

<p>At Gamescom Opening Night Live on August 20, one of the biggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcements was the confirmation</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was heading to PlayStation 5 (PS5). Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Indiana Jones creative director Axel Torvenius and design director Jens Andersson spoke of the game coming to PS5 and their thoughts on the move.</p>



<p>Neither person would go into details on the decision making behind bringing the game to PS5 after its console exclusivity window with Xbox ends. Rather, they focused on the excitement of it simply happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-studio-thinks-of-indiana-jones-on-ps5">What The Studio Thinks Of Indiana Jones On PS5</h2>



<p>“From MachineGames’ point of view, we are super thrilled and excited over the fact we will be able to be on PlayStation next year as well,” Torvenius said. “The more people that can play the game – who can see all the passion and love we have put into this project and all the hard work – the merrier.”</p>



<p>Andersson added that it’s something the studio wanted to do from the start. He also said that the extra time after the game’s launch in December gives them more time to prepare it for the PS5 while clarifying that the technology used for development can handle multiple platforms.</p>



<p>“This is also the opportunity to mention our technology is based on id Tech,” he said. “We have our own, modified, version of id Tech, but it is originally a multi-platform engine. So we have a great start to it already.”</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on December 9</a> for Xbox Series X|S and PC.
