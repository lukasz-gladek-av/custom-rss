                <p>There have been plenty of solid fishing games over the years, but this new one ups the ante. Fish Hunters: The Most Ridiculous Fishing Simulator is a new PC game where players haul in fish with rods, but then the fish are vaulted into the sky and players blast away at them with automatic weapons. It sounds similar to the popular mobile game Ridiculous Fishing, but with a first-person perspective and more action.</p><p>From developer Dos Ivanes and publisher Polden Publishing, Fish Hunters riffs on the idea that fishing is boring (and in reality, it can be; after all, it's called fishing, not catching). "Fishing can be a total snoozefest, right?" a character says in the announcement trailer. "But not this one."</p><p>"In Fish Hunters, you ain't got time to get bored. Grab quests, search for the right fish in different bodies of water, and shoot that bad boy with everything you've got," the trailer narrator says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcRYaOuLf2k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mcRYaOuLf2k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fish Hunters includes more than 140 species of fish, ranging from little minnows to giant sea monsters, the developer says. Players will unlock new rods, lures, and bait as they progress, while the game supports solo play or co-op with up to four total players.</p><p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468330/Fish_Hunters_The_Most_Ridiculous_Fishing_Simulator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo for Fish Hunters is out now on Steam</a>.

			<p>In the world of anthropomorphic gaming characters, bats are relatively rare. There seem to be countless foxes and cats running around competing quests and being heroes, so having a little bat dude with a yoyo is a refreshing change of pace. That being said, Pippit being a bat has very little bearing on the game itself – he can’t even fly! What our batty hero <em>does</em> have, however, is an incredible useful yoyo that serves as both weapon and navigation device in some of the most intricately designed top down levels you’ll find outside of a traditional Zelda dungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo - Release Date &amp; Console Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jE-RFPhjTjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We first meet Pippit on his way back from a big yoyo tournament as he recounts his excitement to a bemused taxi driver. The driver’s tone changes as soon as he realises that the young bat is a member of the dominant Pipistrello family who run the energy monopoly in the city. The scene is set for Pippit to be the exception to the rule in a family that seems to be a direct analogue for multinationals and corporations. Pippit is on his way to visit his aunt, the CEO of the company, but this trip does not go as planned. The end result is his aunt’s soul being split between four mega-batteries held by area bosses with the remaining part trapped within Pippit’s yoyo.</p>


<p>Pipistrello is a gorgeous game. Lovely pixel art and detailed backgrounds set the scene and there is also a real sense of character to the main antagonists. The range of enemies is decent, with new ones being introduced regularly throughout the game, each having specific attack patterns and weaknesses for you to learn. The soundtrack is solid too, with a surprising collaboration with Yoko Shimomura of Kingdom Hearts fame (amongst many others).</p>


<p>I played through the game on my Steam Deck, a choice that seemed to make sense given the in-game conceit that Pipistrello is being played on a Pocket Trap handheld (named after the devs themselves) and it performed excellently on that device. I was a little disappointed that nothing was really made of the meta framing idea of this being a new handheld system, but that might be a running theme for their future titles.</p>
<p>So, that’s the background and aesthetic covered, how does Pipistrello play? The closest comparison to the game is a traditional top-down Zelda game as you explore an overworld with areas locked off by specific abilities and upgrades to find dungeons that revolve around the skilful use of said new skills. Obviously Nintendo’s flagship adventure series has evolved to become a different (Divine) beast in recent years, but I freely admit to being one of those who have a stronger connection to the earlier titles. With that in mind, Pipistrello was both perfectly pitched for me but also found itself in direct competition with my nostalgic memories.</p>
<p>Exploring the overworld is kept fresh through some witty interactions with various locals, a large number of hidden items and some tricky environmental puzzles to get access to each boss area. As you explore the dense cityscape you can unlock taxi points to enable fast travel. This becomes especially useful when searching for collectables and upgrades later in the game.</p>

<p>Initially, your yoyo is relatively basic and can be used as a melee weapon or to grab items that are out of reach. Levels are intricately designed with triangular blocks that you can bounce your yoyo off to reach further. Identifying these blocks and the pattern they set out is crucial to navigating the levels and the game excellently trains you in spotting the different ways these can be set out. By the end of the game you’ll be pulling off yoyo parkour sections that look impossible at the beginning. These skills are also needed to tackle the various bosses throughout the game and these fights are well designed and challenging.</p>
<p>As well as simple back and forth yoyo abilities you unlock various more complex skills named after all the famous yoyo moves like Around the World and Walk the Dog. It does leave me to ask what happened to yoyos in the real world? They were huge for a few years in the 80s and 90s but I can’t remember the last time I saw somebody with one. Anyway, these abilities can be used in both combat encounters and in exploring the world as you’ll eventually be able to soar across water hazards, grind around the walls to avoid pits and even suspend the yoyo in midair and use it to spring across impassable gaps. Once your full range of skills is unlocked the sheer thrill of navigating the complex levels is up there with the best of Nintendo’s own game design.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Pispistrello and the Cursed Yoyo is a fantastic top down adventure game that deserves to be considered in the same echelon as classic Nintendo titles. It takes the traditional Zelda framework and reimagines it to create a world that is incredibly fun to explore. The thrill of nailing the yoyo traversal mechanics remains throughout and while the combat can be a little repetitive at times, this is equally the case with Link's various adventures. All in all, this is peak indie gaming and comes very highly recommended.	</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingmakers-early-access-release-date-revealed-for-october.1200420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Redemption Road have finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, although the game will be landing perhaps a little later than you might have expected.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/516336614597722796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 8th. Redemption Road acknowledges that some may have been "expecting it sooner", and that the game didn't make its previously-announced Q2 release window.</p>

<p>However, the studio says that "building a game where time-traveling mercs drop air strikes on medieval knights takes a hell of a lot of toiling", and that the aim is to give players "a game that hits hard and holds up", a goal for which the devs are currently "grinding".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-early-access-release-date-castle.jpg?itok=OOLGts7e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-early-access-release-date-castle.jpg?itok=_IVAaUR9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers</em>' ambitious mix of third-person shooting and medieval strategy is coming to Early Access in fall.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>was first announced back in February last year, attracting attention for its&nbsp;<em>Darkest of Days</em>-style blend of modern military aesthetics with a medieval setting.</p>

<p>The game quickly began accruing wishlists and followers on Steam, with publisher tinyBuild announcing last year that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in development</a>, despite the fact that the game didn't have anything approaching a release date at that point.</p>

<p>Following that announcement,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 in December</a>, and while Redemption Road promised the game would arrive in the first quarter of the year, it was subsequently pushed back again to the second quarter (and then again to October).</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>, Redemption Road describes it as an "epic action/strategy sandbox" in which you must "change the course of history and save the future" by traveling back in time with your "vast arsenal of modern weapons".</p>

<p>You'll switch between hitting the ground as a soldier equipped with modern military tools and issuing orders to your troops strategy-style, and you'll need to build fortifications to keep your troops safe as well.</p>

<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a> on October 8th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Here at <em>Kotaku</em>, I’ve been recapping each episode of the show, and I have not been having a good time. Frankly, I find it to be a mostly irredeemable attempt at adapting the narrative of the PS4 game. But what about the rest of the internet? Surely not everyone is as disappointed as I am and plenty of them enjoyed the show, right? Well, yeah. But they’re not quite as loud as the folks who weren’t thrilled with the finale and season at large.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197576" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197576,197567,197565" data-current="197576"><div><p>PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23099.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>To start on a positive note, despite fans being divided over Bella Ramsey’s performance as Ellie, with some criticizing it for its more immature approach to the character compared to Ashley Johnson’s in the game, several fans sang their praises of Ramsey’s work in the finale. Personally, I appreciated that the show pulled off Ellie’s disillusionment with the people of Jackson despite what I felt was poor writing, and Ramsey’s execution of this tension finally boiling over received some praise.</p><p>However, with the show reaching one of its most climactic moments in the finale, many game fans are growing increasingly frustrated with the embellishments HBO has made. Some take issue with how certain characters’ personalities have been altered, like Jesse being an asshole instead of the golden retriever we once knew, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-kaitlyn-dever-buff-ripped-gym-1851754822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-kaitlyn-dever-buff-ripped-gym-1851754822">Abby lacking the muscle</a></span> that once signified her obsession with killing her father’s murderer. Despite some praise for Ramsey’s performance, many longtime fans remain critical of Ellie’s newfound sadism and how she seems far less confident than her game counterpart. This is on top of weeks of criticism from fans who think that Ellie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-dina-ellie-romance-sex-scene-pregnant-episode-4-1851779166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-dina-ellie-romance-sex-scene-pregnant-episode-4-1851779166">feels infantilized</a></span> in the show, especially when compared to her girlfriend Dina, who is carrying the angry, vengeful torch in her stead.</p><p>Character traits are one deviation from the source material fans are up in arms about, but perhaps the most controversial change in the finale involves the death of Mel. As in the game Ellie kills Mel, one of Abby’s friends who was with her on the expedition to kill Joel, but unlike in the game, here it’s an accident. Ellie fires a bullet at Mel‘s partner Owen and she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the shot goes right through him and into her. In the source material, this is one of the most impactful moments of Ellie’s revenge tour, as it also results in the death of Mel’s unborn child, making Ellie confront just how much collateral damage she’s caused in her myopic need for vengeance. Fans argue that by making this kill an accident, the show is undermining Ellie’s story which originally showed her undergoing a deliberate descent into violent rage, and instead lets her off the hook by shifting the blame.</p><p>Not everyone hates the change, though. Again, Ramsey’s skill at communicating Ellie’s devastation has received praise, and some view it as a moment of the character’s true compassion coming out.</p><p>A lot of this discourse can arguably be chalked up to “Game fans are just precious about the original scenes.” Some might believe the show should be judged on its own merits rather than compared to the game it’s adapting, but many, myself included, feel that even on its own terms, the show is a mess of tonal contradictions and confused characterization. To me, examining it through the lens of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiT2VFyOr-A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiT2VFyOr-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s attempts to further capitalize on the series, even to the detriment of its story and integrity,</a></span> is the only way that it’s even interesting to talk about. If you take those elements away from the discussion, in my opinion the show is just bad in a boring way, with amateurish writing and inconsistent performances. </p><p>A lot of those problems are rooted in what seems to be an attempt to sanitize the original text and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">avoid controversy</a></span>. However, the show’s inconsistent writing makes it feel like mash-up of competing stories in which Ellie’s motivations swap at the drop of a hat, which is frustrating to follow even without the context of playing the games. It’s easy to handwave criticisms as game fans simply not liking changes from the beloved source material, and if someone’s critique starts and ends with “the show is different than the games,” that’s not in and of itself making a qualitative point, it’s merely an observation. But as much as some people on both sides want to reduce the argument to dismissive extremes, the truth of the discussion exists somewhere in the middle, and right now it feels like some diehard game fans and show newcomers are ready to dismiss each other’s claims and praise on principle without hearing each other out. </p><p>Personally, I’ve found the show rewarding as a game fan because it’s been interesting to unpack <em>why</em> I think these changes are problems, rather than just being upset that it’s not recreating the game beat for beat. A lot of the show’s embellishments have felt like change for change’s sake. The <em>Last of Us </em>games felt very intentional in the story they wanted to tell, so taking a wrecking ball to so many characters and moments has made the show feel like a much less confident and coherent text. I don’t think it can be salvaged after this, but we’ll see if season three, which will primarily star Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, can turn things around.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Ru Weerasuriya, creative director of The Order: 1886, explained in an French-language interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSkKtcblIOQ&amp;t=1165s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Julien Chieze</u></a>, the sequel was in the early stages of development before it was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In The Order: 1886, a game that re-writes history by introducing a unique vision of Victorian-Era London, you discover history’s darkest secret. From its 10-page pitch, Weerasuriya said the first sequel would have boasted bigger combat sequences, as well as an additional multiplayer mode. The third game didn't even make it to early production, but Weerasuriya and the team at Ready at Dawn had planned where the story would've taken them, as well as other instalments which could've taken the franchise into the 20th century.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready at Dawn was a venerable, 20-year-old game studio that worked on God of War and Daxter among other projects. Following the mixed reception of The Order: 1886, Ready at Dawn began to move into VR, releasing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lone-echo">Lone Echo</a> for the Oculus Rift in 2017.

Like a lot of players at the time, here at IGN we thought the 2015 game was okay, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-order-1886-review"><u>awarding it a 6.5</u></a>, writing: "Though a stylish adventure, The Order: 1886 emphasizes its cinematic polish at the crippling cost of gameplay freedom."</p><div id="the-25-best-ps4-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 25 best PS4 games</h3><h3>The 25 best PS4 games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

It has elements of Grand Theft Auto, Watch Dogs, Cyberpunk, and a user generated content portion that has been labeled “AAA Minecraft.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Q&amp;A session on Discord, reviewed by IGN, Gerhard, who goes by the username MMG on the platform, was asked: “Do you think that all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“100%,” Gerhard responded, before adding: “Doesn't take much to guess who 🤣”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This accusation sparked a number of shocked responses, including one who said: “A co-CEO for a studio implying another studio is paying previewers to talk negatively about your game is an absolutely wild comment to make in a public environment in any situation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gerhard responded to that comment by saying: “Not wild when its [sic] true.....”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some users, who had clearly expressed concern about MindsEye and Build A Rocket Boy in the Discord in the past, wondered whether they were the target of Gerhard’s comments. One such user, ‘Cyber Boi,’ sparked a separate response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Folks I never said Cyber Boi was being paid by anyone," Gerhard insisted. "I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. Its [sic] pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gerhard was then asked to clarify his comments by another user: “So just to clarify — you believe that individuals, be it content creators or otherwise, have been paid off to criticise MindsEye?” Gerhard then appeared to walk back the initial accusation, responding: “No I never said that. I do KNOW that there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments, still live on the Discord at the time of this article’s publication, were subsequently picked up on social media and began to circulate online. Gerhard has so far failed to provide evidence to back up his claims. Build A Rocket Boy and publisher IO Interactive, the studio behind Hitman, declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye carries a $59.99 price tag. At launch, there is a “tightly crafted linear story campaign,” and what’s called “single-player free roam,” but there are also a number of missions: a horde mode mission called “Destruction Site Shootout,” and two combat missions (“Honor Amongst Thieves” and “Friendly Fire”). Also at launch are six races, six checkpoint races, and three drone races. If you get the premium pass, you get an extra horde mode mission and an exotic cosmetics pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following launch, Build A Rocket Boy said it will deliver a “constant stream” of fresh premium content monthly, “ensuring MindsEye is a living, ever-expanding player experience.” This includes new missions, challenges, and game assets. “The continuous stream of studio-developed content, combined with the very best of the community’s own beautiful creations, means that MindsEye will continue to surprise and delight its players for decades to come,” Build A Rocket Boy added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy also confirmed its 2025 roadmap of content. In the summer there will be community updates, new missions, in the fall new single-player modes, multiplayer, and new missions, and in the winter free roam updates and new missions. Premium pass owners get extra missions and new packs throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

			<p>During yesterday's tinyBuild Connect 2025 show, developer Fire &amp; Frost shared a world overview trailer for their upcoming third-person open-world old-school RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-teams-up-with-fire-frost-studios-to-create-of-ash-and-steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Ash and Steel</a>. The trailer is narrated by Tristan, a cartographer who also happens to be the game's hero, albeit a bit casually. Moreover, signups for an upcoming playtest are now open on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. While the date hasn't been finalized yet, the developers said players will be able to experience a few of the quests and the story's beginning.</p>
<p>According to Fire &amp; Frost, Grayshaft, where Of Ash and Steel is set, is one of the seven islands that make up the Kingdom of the Seven. While filled with beautiful environments, such as peaceful meadows stretching alongside endless crop fields, thick, ancient forests soon take over the horizon, shrouding crumbling ruins and long-forgotten relics.</p>
<p>The locals describe the island as a living entity, temperamental and unstable. The weather can change in an instant, a gentle breeze turning into a violent storm in moments. While some parts of the island bloom with color and life, others remain frozen all year round. Not even the ancient volcano at the heart of the island can warm the lands it overlooks.</p>
<p>Danger lurks around every corner. Whether players wander well-trodden paths or venture down hidden trails, chances are they shall encounter bloodthirsty beasts, merciless scavengers, and monstrous creatures. Still, those who persevere will be rewarded: hidden caves, buried treasures, and long-lost secrets await the brave.</p>
<p>Wildlife, bandits, and monsters are not the only dangers on the island: Grayshaft is also home to factions, some of which are vying for control and power. The Order of the Seven is renowned for its code and discipline, while the Free Hunters answer only to their own sense of justice. Many more groups operate in the shadows or on the fringes of society, so players won't know who to trust at first glance.</p>

            <p>The co-CEO of MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy has suggested the game's negative reaction so far has been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio ahead of its release.</p>
<p>MindsEye is an upcoming action-adventure thriller from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, which is being published by Hitman studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>. It is set for release on 10th June, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>A new trailer was released last night, highlighting some of the features coming to the game such as the ability for players to create their own missions using the in-game creation system. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>However, despite the trailers and having veteran developers working at the studio, the reaction to MindsEye has so far been underwhelming. A <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1925528143843999907">bulleted rundown listing issues with the game</a>, which was shared online earlier this week, called MindsEye a "broken mess, filled with bugs" and enemy encounters that "lacked depth".</p>
<p>Now, Build a Rocket Boy's co-CEO has claimed that there is a reason MindsEye is getting negative feedback - it's because people are being paid to do so. In an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server, Mark Gerhard was asked if he believes "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone", to which he replied: "100 percent."</p>
<p>When another user in the chat highlighted Gerhard's claims were rather unexpected, the studio exec replied: "Not wild when it's true....."</p>
<p>In another reply, the studio exec added it "doesn't take much to guess who" with an accompanying laughing emoji, though he didn't elaborate on this point further at the time. However, when confronted about the matter further, Gerhard said there has been a "concerted effort" involved regarding criticism around the game and the studio.</p>
<p>Wrote Gerhard: "I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. It's pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Build a Rocket Boy for comment on Gerhard's claims, however neither the studio or publisher IOI was able to say more at this time.</p>

			<p>Those lucky enough to get a Nintendo Switch 2 before its official launch will only have a rather expensive paperweight on their hands until the system's day one update goes live, according to new online reports.</p>
<p>As reported by Wario64 on X following a short YouTube video featuring a quick unboxing of the system, which has since been removed but has been saved for posterity by <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1927448039330894258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Crave</a>, a user who got an early unit of the console confirmed that the console cannot play any game, neither Switch 1 nor Switch 2 games, without downloading the day 1 update which cannot be done as of now, as the update function will not be available before June 5th, the day the system officially launches worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another person shared with me that they have a Nintendo Switch 2 as well. I have no permission to post pics but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts "Please connect to the internet and update your system."</p>
<p>Needs update to boot a game <a href="https://t.co/18TU7Skk1D">pic.twitter.com/18TU7Skk1D</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Though disappointing, the Nintendo Switch 2 not being able to play any game before its official release date next week will have no impact on the popularity of a system that is rightly expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massive success</a>. Launching with the system on June 5th are plenty of games that will definitely contribute to the system's popularity, such as Mario Kart World, which will likely feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-reverse-track-mode/">reverse track mode</a> as suggested by some recent footage, and a slew of third-party developers ports such as Cyberpunk 2077, which is already showing well <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">before release</a> what the system is capable of, Hogwarts Legacy and a few others. The immediate future is also looking bright, with games like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4: Echoes and others launching in 2026 and beyond, which may be able to deliver better visuals and performance by using more of the system resources than the launch window games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/">according to rumors</a>.</p>

The concern, he suggests, is that as they inevitably expand on a bedrock of first-party titles it will become harder for third-party studios and indies to cross that divide.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions that's really dangerous, because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's really, really risky because there always must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yoshida believes Sony delivered a &quot;healthier&quot; subscription model">Yoshida believes Sony delivered a "healthier" subscription model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing Xbox Game Pass and how Microsoft has evolved the platform by adding more first-party titles while also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-really-wants-you-to-know-day-one-releases-no-longer-standard-on-xbox-game-pass">regaining on its initial pledge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to bring every single Xbox Game Studio project to the service on day one, Yoshida said the company might have bitten off more than it could chew.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/apple-has-its-first-ever-internal-studio-after-acquiring-sneaky-sasquatch-dev-rac7" target="_self" data-discover="true">Apple has its first-ever internal studio after acquiring Sneaky Sasquatch dev RAC7</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While acknowledging his own bias as a former PlayStation exec, Yoshida suggested Sony's take on the subscription model through PlayStation Plus—which has seen the company make major first-party titles available to subscribers, but only after a traditional premium release—was perhaps "healthier."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I believe the way Sony approached [subscriptions] is healthier. You know, not to overpromise and to allow people to spend money to buy the new games," he added. "After a couple of years there won't be many people willing to buy those games at that initial price, so they'll be added to the subscription service and there'll be more people to try [those products] in time for the next game in the franchise to come out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although he feels Microsoft might have made an initial misstep with that 'day one' pledge, Yoshida said the company has excelled in other areas. He described Microsoft's approach to backwards compatibility—which saw the company make it possible for Xbox Series X | S owners to play thousands of original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One titles—as "smart and very well planned."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They must have put a lot of engineering effort in to achieve what they have done," he continued.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developer-revives-flash-game-after-creator-finds-source-code-on-kid-s-laptop" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cult Flash game revived after programmer rescues source code from kid's laptop</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft wasn't the only company to receive plaudits during our chat.

			<p>A new version of the Dark Souls Re-Remastered visual overhaul mod is now available for download, introducing significant improvements in select locations.</p>
<p>The 1.27 version of the mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/642?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces new, higher resolution specular maps for most of Firelink Shrine, Undead Burg, and The Depths, significantly improving the visuals in these locations. To celebrate the release of the new version of the mod and the 100K downloads, the developer fromsoftserve shared a new video showcasing the improvements outlined above. You can check out the video below.</p>

<p>Dark Souls Re-Remastered is being developed by the same developer who created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remastered Project</a>, a visual overhaul mod made possible by the impressive emulation improvements delivered by the ShadPS4 emulator, making the PlayStation 4 exclusive playable on PC. The mod adds dynamic shadows to every map, upscales almost every texture, generates new normal maps for most surfaces, better water reflections and distant geometry, adjusted depth of field, better ambient occlusion on the player lantern, and more.</p>
<p>Dark Souls Re-Remastered is compatible with the Remastered version of the first entry in the series created by FromSoftware released a while back on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

            <p>
Ho, Lethal Companions! Put down your airhorns, let fall your precious armfuls of plastic fish, and prick up your freakin' ears. Something is coming to 2023's breakout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> multiplayer game. Something that will make the music boxes and springhead marionettes look like child's playthings! I mean, like the child's playthings they already look like, but without the parts that make them horrifying. That something is... to be announced, but I considered the below teaser text pithy enough to be worth a shout regardless.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The new creature is technically maybe the most powerful creature in the game, and the power easily goes to its head," explains appallingly young developer Zeekerss on <a href="https://x.com/ZeekerssRBLX/status/1926872112347722041">social media</a>. "Sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense, just because it can."
</p>
<p>
There is an infinity of enigma couched within the words "sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense". There are countless things in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> that defy sense-making, not least the game's players, who repeatedly land on emaciated moons populated by giant spiders and ghost girls to harvest rubber duckies and V-type engines, which they then feed to a mouth in a wall. I look forward to experiencing how Zeekerss plans to raise the stakes. 
</p>
<p>
In general, I like the idea of an entity deliberately deciding to do things that seem nonsensical. When we encounter this in other games, we tend to call it an error, depending on our flexible understanding of where the border between sense and nonsense lies. I've always enjoyed reading forum thread attempts to reach across the line and redefine "purely" errant behaviour as plausible. For example, weaving a little mythology around the fact that horses in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> are able to witness crimes. It's because every horse in Tamriel is descended from Horseplay, God of Tattletaling.
</p>
<p>
Lethal Company's thunder has been stolen by, amongst others, the recent R.E.P.O., with its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/repo-is-steams-latest-viral-horror-despite-its-high-mate-requirement">"Jim Henson does Nier Automata"</a> characters. Still, it remains a grand and very sociable anti-capitalist chiller. I'm deeply thankful to Zeekerss for engineering a genre of extraction game in which the extraction process is fundamentally cursed. On which note, this news article is now over - please gather up your airhorns and plastic fish and get back to the ship, pronto. Does anybody hear giggling?

My sherry-swilling, moustache-twirling armchair theorist understanding of <a href="https://www.secore.org/en/our-work/all-about-corals/coral-reef-crisis">ocean-wide coral decline</a> is that addressing it will require a, forgive me, seachange in attitudes towards the "natural" realm we generally position as external and other, ripe for the despoiling - a new way of inhabiting and co-constituting this mote caught in a sunbeam, this stargazing planet from which lamentation is spun, this blithe blue impossibility we (but who are "we"???) call home. Failing that, perhaps we can ask some magic Pixar squid to play underwater <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is my fairly jaded introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-below">Life Below</a>, the latest game from Trolls vs Vikings devs Megapop and Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus publishers Kasedo, which I do genuinely find intriguing in that it is trying to do two, somewhat incompatible things.

On the one polyp, it wants to educate players about organisms that, as the PR pitch explains, make up 0.01% of the ocean floor, and yet support 25% of ocean life, with input from marine biologists. On the other polyp, it would hate you to get the impression that it's just here to teach you things. Heavens, no! Life Below is a real-ass strategy management game, whose relatively bizarre pedagogic aspects are kept firmly in check, but hopefully not suffocated by its adherence to genre.</p>
<p>"While the environment and sustainability are important themes, this isn't 'edu-tainment' - this is a <em>proper</em> strategy game," comments the press release, emphasis theirs. They also want it to be one of "the most accessible city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> ever": Life Below is being created in collaboration with disability consultant Arevya and gaming charity Special Effect UK. 
</p>
<p>
In Life Below, you are a representative of Gaia, personification of Earth's life force. Gaia is often invoked in games with upbeat ecological vibes. I would quite like wholesome gamedevs to spend more time reading about Gaia as originally depicted in Greek myth. In keeping with much of Greek myth, it's an absolute quagmire. Did you know that Gaia spawned Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, using the hacked-off testicles of her husband, Uranus, after she conspired with her son Cronus to have him carved to pieces, in vengeance for Uranus turning Gaia's very body into a kind of cyclops petting zoo? Let's have some of <em>that</em> in games with eco themes, and fewer puppy-eyed jellyfish bois.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how it works is that you send out your twinkling octopus children to cultivate a grid of barren seafloor, planting the equivalent of buildings on resource nodes, and using fixtures such as "seagrass lure" to summon a range of aquatic species to your coral city. You must then keep those lifeforms happy and protect them from threats. The latter include biome change, infestations of creatures who threaten to wreck the reef's equilibrium, and fluctuating algae levels. 
</p>
<p>
The worst nasties, such as oil spills and floating garbage patches, may require the attention of "special wildlife". Without consulting any Wiki pages, I'm envisaging some kind of plastic-eating bacteria who live inside the mouth of a roving basking shark. Not all the external elements are undesirable: sometimes, a nice whale might swim overhead. I'm not sure what the effect will be on your reef. It'll be interesting to discover whether Life Below can translate any of its oceanic learnings into novel mechanics, or whether this is just a Little Mermaid skinpack for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game is out in 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932150/Life_Below/">The Steam page is here</a>. Look out for a demo during Next Fest in June.

			<p>A new Oblivion Remastered mod now available for download makes the Imperial City more atmospheric and beautiful at night with the introduction of new light sources.</p>
<p>The Rabbit's Real Lights Imperial City, now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2852?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces over 500 new hand-placed light sources and objects that provide better visibility at night and make the Imperial City more beautiful than ever. So far, new lights have been added to the Arena District, Elven Garden, Imperial Palace, Market District, Talos Plaza, Temple District, Arboretum, and Arcane District, leaving only the Prison District in its vanilla state. This mod is also fully compatible with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumiere - Lights of Cyrodiil mod</a>, which adds light sources outdoors all over Cyrodiil, making the two mods complementary and a must-download for those looking to improve how the game looks at night.</p>

<p>Oblivion Remastered launched late last month after having been rumored to be in the works for a while. Powered by both Unreal Engine 5 and the original engine, the remaster is extremely faithful in terms of gameplay, making the experience instantly familiar to those who have already ventured into Cyrodiil, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>For those yet to play the game, the number 33 is key to the story. Players control the 33rd expedition on a mission to stop the mysterious Paintress from killing the population. The game then plays on this number in multiple ways - the maximum level for your weapons is 33, for one example.</p>

			<p>Mario Kart World may feature a reverse track mode instead of a traditional mirror mode, judging from some gameplay footage recently shared online.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/it-seems-that-you-can-play-courses-in-reverse-in-mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NintendoSoup</a>, one of the game's Japanese commercials features the Mario Bros. Circuit seen in previous footage of the game, but with some notable differences highlighted by the mini map, which is effectively reversed. While this reverse mode could be available in Knockout Tour or Versus mode, the in-game interface did not have elements of either mode, so there's a good chance playing tracks in reverse was revealed ahead of time with the new commercial.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World   NEW EXCLUSIVE JAPANESE Gameplay Footage Switch 2 4K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wuhtJfj54?start=51&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mario Kart World was revealed last month together with the Nintendo Switch 2, and it is set to become one of the most popular launch games for the next-generation system. Though revealed only recently, the game has been in development for a very long time, possibly even longer than most expected, as it was confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-has-been-in-development-since-the-launch-of-the-first-switch-console/">last week</a> that Mario Kart World has been in development since the launch of the original Switch. Its more open-ended formula was created to push the series formula after perfecting it with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the system launches worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>
