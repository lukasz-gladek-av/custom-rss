			<p>Eidos Montreal doesn't seem to have given up entirely on the Deus Ex series and has reportedly pitched a new entry in the series to multiple publishers, sadly to no avail.</p>
<p>On the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Insider Gaming</a> Weekly podcast, it was revealed that, following the cancellation of a new entry in the series, which came as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/">Embracer's restructuring</a>, the development studio started pitching a new Deus Ex game completely separate from the one that Embracer canceled to multiple publishers to see who would be interested in the game. Sadly, none of the publishers that have been contacted showed an interest, and one in particular said that the series is too niche to do anything with. As Eidos Montreal pitched the game to anyone in the market who would even listen to a game pitch, we shouldn't expect this game to see the light of day anytime soon, if ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Reveal, Battlefield's Battle Royal, And A Game From A Classic Series Being Pitched" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgveqrF7Sug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As things stand, and with publishers being more averse than ever to taking risks, as highlighted by Tom Henderson in the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast above, it looks like Deus Ex Mankind Divided will remain the final entry in the series for a very long time. You can learn more about the game released back in 2016 in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deus-mankind-divided-review-totally-asked/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Could it be better? Most certainly, as pointed out in the review. But Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is already great as it is, and you would be remiss to leave it hanging in physical (or digital) stores if you care the slightest bit about RPGs with a deep story, lots of choices and a cyberpunk setting.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the US owing to President Donald Trump's impending economic tariffs, and the company hasn't yet announced a new date on which you'll be able to pre-order the console.</p>

<p>Confirming the delay in a statement given to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ameSpot</a>, Nintendo media relations VP Eddie Garcia said the previously-announced pre-order date of April 9th would be pushed back "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>

<p>Garcia said Nintendo will "update timing at a later date", but that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> remains unchanged. It's unclear whether the My Nintendo Store pre-order date of May 8th will remain in place at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-us-tabletop.jpg?itok=6b8lUx8x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-us-tabletop.jpg?itok=Hxxo_cV6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 have been delayed in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Garcia says Nintendo is looking to delay pre-orders due to "evolving market conditions" and that he specifically mentions the tariffs, a potential price change for the Switch 2 in the US isn't out of the realms of possibility.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo announced that the Switch 2 would cost $449.99 in the US, with that price rising to $499.99 if you want the console bundled with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>However, yesterday, US president Donald Trump introduced a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sweeping range of tariffs</a> aimed at various countries and economic bodies, including the European Union, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Other countries, like the UK, Australia, and Brazil, were hit with a baseline tariff of 10%.</p>

<p>Those tariffs will hit Nintendo in some of its key manufacturing centers, which will inevitably cause the company to raise its prices for consumers (since that's <a href="https://time.com/7274160/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-questions-answered-explainer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pretty much always</a> what ends up happening when it comes to tariffs).</p>




<p>Nintendo hasn't yet announced that it will delay pre-orders anywhere outside the US, but if you're in one of the countries that's been hardest hit by Trump's tariffs, you may wish to keep a close eye on things in the near future.</p>

<p>In case you missed the announcement, Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2 earlier this week. It'll come complete with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">1080p screen, a 4K dock, and 120fps support</a> for some games, and it's launching on June 5th (a date which still appears to be intact around the world). Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>A new report has revealed that Nintendo has acquired a third anti-Palworld patent, and a fourth one is almost about to be granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-secures-two-more-anti-palworld-u-s-patents-might-file-multi-patent-u-s-lawsuit-against-pocketpair-in-a-matter-of-months-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo now has three anti-Palworld patents—the first two mentioned in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier report</a>. The latest one, 12,246,255, was granted on March 11, 2025. It concerns smooth switching between flying and land traversal objects. Also, Nintendo’s request to interview the patent examiner was approved, and it seems a fourth patent will be granted soon.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patents-mean-for-pocketpair">What do Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patents Mean for Pocketpair</h2>



<p>Nintendo will soon have four anti-Palworld patents in the United States, which could mean a lawsuit could be filed against Pocketpair soon. The latest approved patent was initially filled in September 2022, but Nintendo has made amendments to it over the years, even after Palworld’s launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s interview with the patent examiner has also been successful. Out of the 23 patent claims, Nintendo has been able to add additional requirements to independent and dependent claims. It has dropped two claims and made limited changes to a claim. Moreover, Nintendo and the Pokemon Company have added a 24th claim, which talks about interacting with a character that a player either battles with or captures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GamesFray believes it is “fairly likely” that Nintendo and The Pokemon Company will file a patent infringement complaint in the US. However, it is not certain, and depending on how things go in Japan, there’s always a chance that the lawsuit will never come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair’s CEO came ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-ceo-under-attack-japan-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under attack in Japan</a> every day’ when Palworld was released. Also, the game could be released on the Switch 2 if the console is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-on-switch-2-is-a-possibility-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beefy enough</a>’. What are your thoughts on Nintendo acquiring more anti-Palworld patents?

MST Financial analyst David Gibson told <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3lludkrrvmc2r" rel="nofollow ">FT</a> that Nintendo had already shipped more than 350,000 Switch 2 units to the USA back in January in an attempt to get ahead of the tariffs. It was also previously speculated by Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis that a Switch 2 "price increase in 2026 might be on the table" if tariffs persist.</p><p>Of course some have theorized that these tariffs might encourage Nintendo to produce Switch 2 units in the United States. However, Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907789618294005816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that this would be incredibly unrealistic.</p><p>"Nintendo would need to spend billions to open a factory in the US," Ahmad said. "It'd probably take 4-5 years to complete this. Not to mention the time and cost to rebuild supply chain infrastructure and source components (which would be subject to tariffs because they're made outside the US). They'd then need to find, train and pay employees to operate the factory."</p><p>During Trump's first presidency, tariffs did not apply to video game consoles because console manufacturers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/">successfully lobbied the government for a special exception.</a> This time, however, it would appear we are seeing the consequences unfold.</p>

            <p>Those in the US looking to pre-order a Switch 2 will have to wait a little longer to do so than first expected.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with GameSpot's <a href="https://x.com/tamoorh">Tamoor Hussain</a>, Nintendo stated pre-orders in the US - which were scheduled to go live on 9th April - will now be delayed "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>

<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs earlier this week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>
<p>According to Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>. Quinn's comment follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad's own earlier this week</a>, where the Niko Partners director of research and insights said:</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p>
<p>While as of today Switch 2 pre-orders have been delayed, Nintendo said the Switch 2 will still release on 5th June in the US, as originally planned. It remains possible retail prices for Switch 2 could change following the news regarding tariffs.</p>

		<p>For a certain cachet of gamers, the most exciting Nintendo game of this year doesn’t have karts or smash-happy apes in them, but space bounty hunters. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has been a long, long time coming, but it’s set to arrive as a key cross-gen game for both Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W9xes7BZto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our hands-on came with the Switch 2 Edition of the game, which will be available separately or as a paid upgrade from the base Switch version of the game.</p>


<p>That gives a number of enhancements, though, with the game able to push a 4K 60fps output or 1080p 120fps to TV (stepping down to 1080p60 and 720p120 when in handheld mode). It’s a real sign of the performance bump that the Switch 2 offers, and works in tandem with the refined visual style, scope and performance that Retro Studios is likely getting out of the original Switch.</p>
<p>We played through the opening stage of the game, as Samus descends to the planet’s surface and finds a bunch of Galactic Federation troops besieged by those dastardly Space Pirates once more. It’s an action-packed and combat-heavy opener, but still gives a little time to make use of Samus’ trademark morph ball mode and her scanning visor, both of which will feature much more heavily when digging into the broader game.</p>


<p>Of course, combat makes this an ideal slice of the game to test the different control options that Switch 2 offers. Just in terms of gamepad controls, we’ve come a long, long way since the original GameCube game and the Wii ports both having… atypical control schemes. This immediately feels like a more contemporary first-person shooter set-up, albeit with a lock-on feature using the left trigger instead of aim-down sights, but this also enables a free aim mode. Jump is also on the left bumper, while the right trigger and bumper are used for Samus’ standard beam and missiles.</p>
<p>Locking onto an enemy also enables a motion controller free aim mode, which will be great for boss battles. Lock onto them so that your strafing and dodging is kept relative to their movement, and then aim for their weak spots as they emerge.</p>
<p>It’s a good set up, but honestly, it pales in comparison to flipping the right Joy-Con 2 on its side and using <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">mouse mode</a> instead. So long as you’re playing with detached Joy-Con 2, you can do this at literally any time, the Switch 2 just knowing when the controller switches orientation and is on a surface, and entering mouse mode, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This just offers so much more natural precision, as PC gamers are well aware. Aiming is easier for keeping enemies in your crosshairs, and leading their movements across the screen – handy when firing slowish rockets their way – but you also still have enemy lock on and free aim when you are holding the left trigger.</p>
<p>It quickly became my preferred way to play through this hands-on session, skewing my senses in a way that made it difficult to go back to gamepad controls. This won’t be for everyone, though, and if you’re playing in handheld mode, with a Pro Controller or even with Joy-Con in their grip, there’s no mouse mode for you. I was also playing in an idealised table/desk setting, and while mouse mode can work great on your trouser legs or sofa arm, that’s less ideal, as anyone who’s living the PC TV life will tell you.</p>
<p>What we saw was just a brief glimpse from the game’s opening. The battles against Space Pirates were fun and it built up to a battle against a Metroid-infested boss, which trapped us in an arena and had us dodging energy waves, charge bolts and more while we targeted weak spots that it struggled to keep covered up.</p>

<p>The climactic moment came after defeating the boss, as more Space Pirates emerge alongside a rebel bounty hunter, blasting an artefact that lends Samus the psychic abilities that were teased in the gameplay reveal from last week. Those will have an integral role through the game, both for the environmental puzzling and the combat</p>
<p>For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States won't begin on April 9th, as originally announced, to allow the company to evaluate the potential impact of tariffs in the country.</p>
<p>As reported on Bluesky by GameSpot Managing Editor Tamoor Hussain, Nintendo confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will not begin on April 9th in order to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." The console's release date is unchanged, so it will still be released on June 5th in the United States as it will in the rest of the world. Needless to say, this is extremely concerning, as the chance of a price increase has now skyrocketed.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:pj5zxr5qexgoitdimyialrcc/app.bsky.feed.post/3llyn7ib2rc2r" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreif4tbopre5v65yvh5do5cezzude346emvst7byuzoeljhkah4wbni" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system">
<p lang="en">Statement from Nintendo: Statement from Nintendo: Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</p>
<p>— Tamoor Hussain (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pj5zxr5qexgoitdimyialrcc?ref_src=embed">@tamoorh.com</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pj5zxr5qexgoitdimyialrcc/post/3llyn7ib2rc2r?ref_src=embed">April 4, 2025 at 4:35 PM</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Even with a price higher than the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">$449.99</a>, will the Nintendo Switch 2 be a worthy purchase? Probably not for some, as Nathan found the console to be maybe too pricey even for $50, despite offering a significant improvement over its predecessor in every possible way, as he highlighted in his hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>If you’re one of the sizable number of folks who have affection for their trusty Switches, it seems quite likely you’ll enjoy the Switch 2. The system looks better, feels better, the Joy-Cons are sturdier and more versatile, and playing Nintendo games with some decent hardware grunt behind them is a nice change of pace. Whether the Switch 2 reaches the commercial heights of the OG Switch will largely depend on its library of games, but titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza show Nintendo can still deliver fun, and sometimes unexpected, experiences with their long-running franchises</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launched on June 5th worldwide. We will keep you updated on the new US pre-order date and any changes in the system's price as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>If you are in the United States (US) and you want to pre-order the Nintendo Switch 2, it looks like you’re going to have to wait. Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will be delayed due to the recently announced tariffs by Donald Trump.</p>



<p>In a statement released by Nintendo, the company says it needs to “assess the potential impact” the tariffs will have on the US market before allowing purchases.</p>



<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” the company said. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>



<p>Pre-orders for the new console move forward as planned for other parts of the world with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-sign-ups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some already available</a>.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was announced as launching June 5, 2025 with a $449.99 price point in the US. Pre-orders for the new system were expected to begin at store opens across various retailers in the country along with other online-only retailers. As of writing, pages for the console remain up on sites like Gamestop and Best Buy. However, no pre-order information can be found. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to a number of US retailers for comment on the delay. Should responses be received, they will be added to this story. </p>

The partnership with Nintendo seemed to affect not just the style of game FromSoft is making, but even the design of the keeper of The Duskbloods' hub area into something different — something... cute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer shown during the Switch 2 Direct this week closed on a shot of a winged rat character, with glowing glyphs drawn all over it, looking at the camera. Curious fans might have wondered what this rat's deal was. As it turns out, this is our new hub companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance," director Hidetaka Miyazaki said <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-3/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with Nintendo</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I suppose you could say we tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked what Miyazaki means by that, he added: "We tried something cute for a change. Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman (laughter)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware's shrine keepers have been central figures for player's journeys through their worlds. Familiar faces like Melina, the Maiden in Black, the Doll, and others are characters you return to over and over on your trip, often offering power to help you move forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a PvPvE game like The Duskbloods, though, it remains to be seen what kind of advice and guidance the winged rat will offer. Miyazaki said the team at FromSoft has tried its hands at introducing "a lot of new and interesting ideas," so expect the unexpected when it hits Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more on The Duskbloods, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods">Bloodborne fan reaction</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-miyazaki-reassures-fans-that-fromsoftware-will-still-actively-develop-single-player-focused-games-despite-online-multiplayer-the-duskbloods">Miyazaki's comments on whether FromSoft plans to leave single-player behind</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, if you're looking for more Switch 2 news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">check out our first hands-on with Nintendo's newest console</a>, its big launch title <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">Mario Kart World</a>, and the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a PvPvE game developed by the Soulsborne studio, but director Hidetaka Miyazaki said this doesn't mean the company has shifted direction moving forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new interview with Nintendo</a>, Miyazaki spoke about the decision to make The Duskbloods a PvPvE game. The director said he's "always found" the structure interesting, as it allows for a broad range of game-design ideas while also letting FromSoftware leverage its experience in designing challenging enemy encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a side note, please allow me to address one thing," Miyazaki said. "As we previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn't mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single-player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the release of Elden Ring in February 2022, FromSoftware has certainly experimented a bit. Its DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, tried out some interesting new power scaling methods <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">in the form of Scadutree Blessings</a>. There's also Elden Ring: Nightreign, an upcoming co-op survival action game that blends the usual Souls style with an encroaching storm, loot, and character archetypes. The studio even went back to its mecha days with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with The Duskbloods, FromSoftware is trying something a little different again. In the interview, Miyazaki said the company's outline for The Duskbloods was "still very bare-bones" when the team presented it to Nintendo — "more a loose string of ideas than a proper presentation," and the concept was "different from anything [FromSoftware] had done before." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo was interested in making it happen though, and while a small team started the project for the original Switch, Nintendo approached FromSoft with the idea of moving to the Switch 2 instead. "The new hardware's focus on online features allowed us to stay as true to the original vision as possible, which was very good news for us," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while The Duskbloods might be a little different from the usual FromSoftware game, it sounds like the studio isn't completely leaving the "traditional" style you'd expect behind. Put differently: let FromSoft cook on this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what could FromSoft's next single-player focused game be? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-2-not-being-considered-at-fromsoftware-hidetaka-miyazaki-says">Miyazaki has said the developer is not currently considering making Elden Ring 2</a>, but late last year left the door open to the possibility in the future. It's probably not <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods">Bloodborne 2</a>, either, much to the frustration of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the Nintendo Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">check out our round-up of everything announced at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> this week, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">read over our recent chat with analysts about the sticker-shock of both the Switch 2 console and some of its games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bethesda's Todd Howard recently revealed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout/" data-ref-id="5000-929">Fallout</a> was adapted as a television series rather than a movie.</p><p>Howard's comments were part of a bigger <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/?open=false#%C2%A7game-studios-desperate-for-switch-dev-kits" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Variety</a> about the process of video game adaptations. In it, Howard explains that a movie version of Fallout would've felt "too compressed" as the game series has such a vast and interesting world.</p><p>"Originally, a lot of people were approaching to do a feature film. And looking at what we wanted to do for this one, that felt too compressed. Fallout is such an amazing world--what would we really want to watch in it? Well, we’d like to watch the next story, or new stories in that world, as opposed to, again, in this instance, adapting a story we had told and kind of compressing it down. For this one, we were very much interested in telling new stories," Howard explained.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kQ8i2FpRDk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="16">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0kQ8i2FpRDk?start=16" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That approach worked out for Bethesda and Amazon, as Fallout was well-received and enjoyed by fans. Now, a second season is in the works. Todd Howard also teased a little about making sure that Fallout feels as welcoming as possible to players by the time the show's second season comes out.</p><p>"So we had done the work for Season 1 to really make the games welcoming to a new audience and have them in a good place. And it was hugely successful. We learned a lot and as we head into future things — knowing when a new season comes out that there’s going to be an audience, both a new one and a returning one to these games — we’re thinking, how do we make it the best it can be for the players?"</p><p>Todd Howard has previously teased Fallout 5, but also admitted that Bethesda Game Studios' focus right now is on continuing development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. Remasters or updates for live service games in the series like Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter feel like possibilities, though.</p><p>Fallout's second season does not have a release window, but the first season is currently available to stream on Prime Video. When it comes to video game TV shows coming out more imminently, an animated Devil May Cry adaptation just released on Netflix, and the second season of The Last of Us begins on HBO later in the month.</p>

Some 13 years later, following numerous delays and botched half-launches, the game has finally arrived on Steam. And oh no, it’s so bad. But before we confront its awfulness, let’s take stock of how we got here.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194416" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch’s Sombra On Her New Film And Its Video Game Connections" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="408" data-playlist="194416,197298,197284" data-current="194416"><div><p>Overwatch’s Sombra On Her New Film And Its Video Game Connections</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19861.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Very old people will remember that in 1986, a game was released by Sierra Online called <em>Space Quest</em>. It was a low-fi parser-based graphic adventure, and it was really not very good. However, creators Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy (known, at their insistence, as The Two Guys from Andromeda) continued to make sequels, and eventually—I would argue especially with <em>Space Quest IV</em>—created something memorable and extremely funny. These games were spoofs of the science fiction boom of the time, in which you played space janitor and general loser Roger Wilco.</p><p>They were crude games in most senses of the word, but at this point the loveable loser hadn’t become the most overused trope in adventure gaming, and the series became known for its very funny ways to die, its incredibly convoluted spoofs, and the dulcet tones of narrator Gary Owens’ voice as he delivered withering one-liners for every thing you looked at, used, licked or combined. This eventually culminated in <em>Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier</em>, released in 1995, just before Sierra’s first (and only good) iteration came to an end. <em>Space Quest VII: The Return to Roman Numerals</em> was in development when Vivendi bought Sierra and cancelled everything.</p><h2 id="h137979"><a id=""></a>The Kickstarter boom</h2><p>A few attempts were made over the years to revive the franchise, but none came to anything, although the games remained cultishly popular through frequent re-releases on PC.

And then, in 2012, the Kickstarter boom arrived. Tim Schafer’s fundraiser for what was then called “Double Fine Adventure” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised over $3.3 million</a></span>, and every single person from the same era of classic point-and-clicks reappeared to try the same. The Guys from Andromeda managed to put their decades of hostility behind them for this gold rush, and riding the wave, secured over $500,000 from nearly 11,000 backers. It was close, the half-million target only being cleared at the eleventh hour, but they’d done it. This was June 2012, and the game was promised to be released in February 2013.</p><p>Keen chronologists will have noticed that 2013 was a very long time ago. Over the last 12 years, a huge number of delays, notes about family tragedies, and apologies have been issued, but nothing approaching a final game.

From June 2019 to March 2020, there was nothing, and then the declaration that the game would be out in June.</p><p>Yes, like you already guessed, in June it was announced beta testing would begin in July. In August 2020, beta testing started. In February 2021 that was complete, the bugs were worked out, and release was imminent—they just had to fix their save/load system. Hold on to your hats, folks!</p><p>Yeah, in November 2021 they hadn’t managed to fix that save/load issue. Literally nine months and this Unity save system couldn’t be figured out. That update finished, “The next update WILL contain info about releasing the game.” Any day now!</p><p>It’s July 25, 2022. “Thank you all again for your patience,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/3565784&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/3565784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the next update began</a></span>, seemingly without irony. They were “very close to finishing.” The last eight months had been taken up with fixing bugs, despite their all having been fixed over a year earlier, and that darned save system! But, in August that year, they finally gave a proper release date. September 16, 2022.</p><p>However, for real, no jokes, no surprises, <em>SpaceVenture</em> was released to backers on that day. Ten years since the Kickstarter was funded, the game was in the hands of its supporters. They did it.</p><h2 id="h137981"><a id=""></a>They didn’t do it</h2><p>I was lying about no surprises.

At this point, former Sierra boss Ken Williams got in touch and offered to help with the project, and none of the people working on the game were getting paid. A fairly typical eight more months went by, when it was revealed they had spent the year trying to move the game to a new version of Unity.</p><p>This process stretched out yet again, the same six-to-eight months between updates, the same declarations that it was so very nearly almost ready, and then at the end of March 2025, it was announced that version 2 of the game was ready to launch on Steam! 13 years later, it was coming out to the public. In fucking Early Access.</p><p>Yup, as of the appositely chosen April 1 this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374960/SpaceVenture/?beta=0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374960/SpaceVenture/?beta=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can buy a copy of <em>SpaceVenture</em> for $15</a></span>.

The game boots in fullscreen, but 1920x1080, and beyond alt-enter to put it into a window, there are no other options whatsoever. Pressing Esc while playing brings up a quit option that doesn’t take you back to the main menu, but the desktop. Admittedly, that’s a timesaver for everyone, but it doesn’t bode well. (Incredibly, when someone asked about this in the Steam discussions, the developers replied, “...it is something we are considering.”)</p><p>Even less impressive is the opening cutscene. Janky, atrociously lit, and barely textured, the shots of a space van docking at a space station appear like the sorts of blocky placeholders you’d put in at the start. It looks like the PC port of a 2002 PS2 game. We then cut to inside the airlock, where our defiantly unlikeable character, the gruff, taciturn Ace Hardway, again looks like a dreadful placeholder model, the rigging obviously unfinished, the animations haphazard and amateurish. I looked at a toolbox on the floor, and the very first description text in the game had a typo. Ho boy.</p><figure id="" data-id="bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-recommend-id="image://bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ace stood next to an airlock, with what might be a cigarette hanging from his mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ace stood next to an airlock, with what might be a cigarette hanging from his mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guys From Andromeda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-recommend-id="image://bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ace stood next to an airlock, with what might be a cigarette hanging from his mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Moments later, I’m trying to walk down a corridor when a burst pipe blasts steam. I’m not going to repeat how bad everything looks throughout this, but know that everything looks <em>bad</em>, like 20 years ago bad. I walk through the steam, deliberately, as the game’s instructions encourage you to try to die for the gags, promising you’ll return alive immediately. Ace lies dead on the floor and I’m now playing as his robot dog/toolbox, Rooter. But when I “use” certain items, Ace’s lines of dialogue reply. Sigh. Also, why am I now playing as a toolbox? And why, now, out of nowhere, does a (decent) impersonation of <em>Space Quest</em>’s wonderful narrator, the late Gary Owens, pipe up at this point but not before? Why wasn’t there any narration during the opening, any explanation of who I was, why I was there?</p><p>So, it turns out, the tool-dog-thing has a cellphone in its possession? And that has an app on it that offers a defibrillator? And you revive Ace with that? Sure, OK.</p><p>You then make your way into a supply closet in an earlier location. You have to move some crates to do this, in a “puzzle” that involves dragging them to create a path. Except someone entirely forgot to implement the puzzle aspect, such that you just have to pull each crate in each direction, until you stumble upon the arbitrary direction in which it’s allowed to move, and then repeat that a few times. Get into the closet, and the stuff you need is blocked by…identical crates. But now you can’t move them, because that would be “manual labor.” What? The solution is to put Rooter on a shelf, such that he can crawl past the crates and then operate a forklift to move them. So you “use” Rooter to pick him up, and then click the resulting icon on the shelf, and…get an endless stream of “nope” messages. Because, of course <em>you idiot</em>, what you’re supposed to know to do is to “talk to” Rooter—who, by the way, you cannot even “look at”—which causes Ace to whistle, which causes Rooter to turn back into a toolbox, and then put <em>that</em> on the shelf. I feel so stupid!</p><p>Rooter can then interact with the forklift, which causes it to move forward and run over Ace, killing him. But no worries! We can just revive him with that defib app! Except, um, nope, you can’t, and this time the scene resets to when you entered the room and you have to start the whole fucking ordeal over again.</p><p>Let me stress, I have so far described <em>the first five minutes</em> of this godawful mess.</p><p>Ordinarily, I try to pick screenshots that are visually appealing when illustrating an article, and that’s obviously been tough here, but it’s important I also include what the game looks like most of the time. Like this extraordinary framing, complete with untextured model on the desk.</p><figure id="" data-id="fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-recommend-id="image://fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hanger bay with the tiny character on the right side, in front of an untextured model." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hanger bay with the tiny character on the right side, in front of an untextured model." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guys from Andromeda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-recommend-id="image://fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hanger bay with the tiny character on the right side, in front of an untextured model." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Oh, and by the way, they never figured out that save bug! Saving to prevent unpredictable deaths doesn’t do anything, because when you reload, you start the scene over again anyway.</p><p>There’s no real point in continuing to list everything that’s wrong here. I’ve persisted on, and every single puzzle has been flawed, there’s no internal prompting about why you can’t just sodding well use an item in an obvious place, and most seriously of all, not one single line of dialogue has been faintly funny. I went into this ready to at least laugh. But it is worth noting what I believe is, aside from any of the technical issues, the game’s biggest, most damaging flaw: Ace Hardway.</p><p>Roger Wilco was a twit, often selfish but lovably goofy, and the <em>Space Quest</em> games hated him for it. He was treated with disdain, and his attempts to climb above the rank of janitor always failed. Ace Hardway isn’t a moron, but just a deeply unlikeable person. He’s rude, incurious, and most of all, deeply dull. But the game loves him. The narrator, despite sounding just like <em>Space Quest IV</em>’s disgusted commentator, constantly celebrates his benign actions, cheers him on. It’s just so weird.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-recommend-id="image://d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sort of giant baby thing, again, textured as if on a PlayStation 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sort of giant baby thing, again, textured as if on a PlayStation 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guys From Andromeda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-recommend-id="image://d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sort of giant baby thing, again, textured as if on a PlayStation 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is a colossal disaster. And while those who backed the project 13 years ago, especially those who backed this at the $10,000 level (three people did!), have every right to be disappointed and frustrated, it’s hard not to also feel a sense of empathetic horror for the developers.</p><p>Clearly, the three main developers—Scott Murphy, Mark Crowe and Chris Pope—were out of their depth from the start. It’s obvious from the grim state of what’s been released that there was little understanding of Unity, nowhere near enough learned over the past decade-and-a-half, and no money to be able to address it. Both Murphy and Crowe have chronicled multiple personal struggles and family tragedies over the last decade, and this game must have been the most awful millstone around their necks throughout. I find I can’t shake off that sense of the burden as I play, a pact signed with the devil that they couldn’t escape, persisting for over a decade after they were meant to be freed. And god, they’re still not free. This is “Early Access,” and the prediction of completion by this summer is clearly as realistic as every other projected release date made since 2013. Honestly, I wish I could break this bond for them, give them permission to just say the game is finished, and garbage. They took an incredibly long time to make a shit game. Then they can move on. But I fear 10,000 backers might not all agree.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is changing everything after its reveal, Battlefield’s Battle Royal mode has been datamined, and there’s a game from a classic franchise being pitched. It’s Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for <strong>April 3, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw, Grant Taylor-Hill, and Albert Perkins give their thoughts on Nintendo’s pricing decision for the Switch 2 and its games after the reveal event. There’s also a rumor about a beloved franchise getting a third installment that the guys just aren’t sure they want to believe is real. Also, why can’t Game of Thrones have good video games?</p>

<p>Nothing brings momentum to a screeching halt quicker than legal action. This is the prospect Schedule 1 is facing as it’s being deemed too similar to Movie Games S.A.’s Drug Dealer Simulator 1 &amp; 2 franchise, prompting a full investigation into the game.</p>



<p>Whereas people were hyping themselves up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone’s Verdansk</a> or continuing to enjoy the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, Steam indie title Schedule 1 was out here dominating. The game is about making and dealing drugs and all the rigors that come with the crime life. This is apparently appealing as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 hit a peak of over 400,000 players</a> and continues to bring in wheelers and dealers each day.</p>



<p>Everything was going great, but on April 3, publisher Movie Games S.A. demanded an investigation into TVGS’ Schedule 1.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-sensation-schedule-1-under-investigation-for-infringement">Steam Sensation Schedule 1 Under Investigation For Infringement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is Schedule 1 in trouble? Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evidence on the investigation surfaced on the website <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes,</a> featuring a document entitled: “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. has its own series of drug-dealing games: Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2. While the name is more overt in its goal, both titles have attracted thousands of players respectively.</p>



<p>The legal document mentions: “Potential infringement of the Issuer’s intellectual property rights and activities that may bear the characteristics of unfair competition have been identified.” Ergo, Schedule 1 is too similar to the Drug Dealer Simulator series—similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s lawsuit with Palworld</a>.</p>



<p>Proceedings began as soon as Schedule 1 released on March 24 and featured: “A comparative analysis of the Company’s IP, which includes, m.in, Drug Dealer Simulator and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 and the Schedule 1 project.”</p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.</p>

Following Nintendo's announcement of the price during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Direct</a> this week, many people made their feelings known about it--and now brands have begun to weigh in.</p><p>Duolingo, the language-learning company, posted this week, "Gamers, learn Japanese to save $133!" This post is referencing how Nintendo will offer a "Domestic Only" console that will sell for ¥49,980, which is about $340. This console is region-locked and only features Japanese as the language default. Duolingo saw an opportunity for a joke here, and to promote its own services.</p><p>The first Nintendo Treehouse Live event this week for the Switch 2 kicked off with users spamming the comments begging the company to lower the price of the system. Nintendo is, of course, unlikely to do this, and some experts believe there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">won't be any price cuts until 2030 at the soonest.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 carrying a heftier price tag than the original Switch ($300 USD in 2017) was always expected, and the price point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">reflects the impact of tariffs and more expensive component prices.</a> Nintendo might have also felt emboldened to go with a higher price after it saw Sony offer the PS5 Pro for $700, some believe. Another analyst believes Nintendo is charging $450+ for the Switch 2 simply because it can.</p><p>"Nintendo is charging this price because they feel they can and that people will pay," analyst Serkan Toto said.</p><p>The Switch 2 is likely to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">sell like wild in its first year</a> due to pent-up demand and based on how shiny new products historically start strong with a buying base that is price-insensitive. But in the second year and beyond, the Switch 2 might skew toward more older and/or more affluent people, experts believe, due in part to its price tag. Overall, the Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">not expected to sell as well as the first Switch</a>, which has sold more than 150 million units worldwide.</p><p>Switch 2 games are being called out for their price tags, too, with much of the focus on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>.

Nintendo has offered no explanation or defense for the increased price, but one retailer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-has-earned-a-shockingly-low-amount-after-first-month/1100-6526440/" data-ref-id="1100-6526440">video game prices need to go up to help offset rising development and production costs.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's hands-on previews with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World.</a> The Switch 2 launches on June 5.</p>

		<p>Lumo 2 has been announced by Numskull Games and developer Triple Eh?, with this sequel coming nine years after Lumo first came out. Lumo has been available on PC, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox One, Switch, and Xbox One. Lumo 2 will be released for PC, PS5, and Switch at some point in 2025, though a more specific release window is yet to be announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumo 2 Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFtJJv46jfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lumo 2 has been inspired by the era of 8-bit games, with the levels being based on games from that period. Dimensions will shift dungeon to dungeon with perspectives and gameplay also changing. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/24/lumo-review/">review for Lumo</a>, I said, <em>“Lumo is full of well thought out puzzles, but it lacks certain gameplay touches that could have pushed it into being a great game. My main gripe is that the jumping feels awkward and, coupled with perspective issues, means you can fail a simple puzzle dozens of times. The game does have a certain charm to it, and I would recommend it as a nostalgia trip for players that grew up with similar games, but this will not be for those who aren’t fans of classic titles or puzzles.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Arguably, the most unexpected game announcement made during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromSoftware's The Duskbloods</a>. Today, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a lengthy interview with FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki, revealing lots of information on the upcoming game.</p>
<p>The creator of Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Elden Ring revealed that the project started on the original Nintendo Switch. When Nintendo reached out about the Switch 2, FromSoftware realized it would have been better off making it for the more powerful console.</p>
<p>Miyazaki confirmed it is a PvPvE game, which is a formula that the studio considers very interesting because 'it allows for a broad range of game-design ideas while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters.' However, the revered game designer also wanted to clarify in no uncertain terms that the Japanese studio is not at all abandoning single player games, despite The Duskbloods and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imminent launch of Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which is also focused on multiplayer:</p>
<p><em>Please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</em></p>
<p>Miyazaki then proceeded to reveal a few tidbits about the setting of The Duskbloods. Players will be able to pick from over twelve playable characters, all of whom belong to a group called Bloodsworn. These Bloodsworn attained superhuman abilities by drinking special blood in a manner not unlike vampires, although the creator said they focused on the romantic side of the vampire lore instead of the monstrous side. The Bloodsworn are reportedly competing for something called 'First Blood', being summoned to the 'Twilight of Humanity' across various places and times. That's why the trailer showed very different locations.</p>
<p>Given their background, the Bloodsworn will be able to pull off more dramatic moves than in previous FromSoftware games. Also, due to the setting, each character will be equipped with some sort of ranged attack (mostly firearms), in another distinction from the studio's usual melee focus. The characters can also be customized to an extent.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Duskbloods – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In The Duskbloods, players will first join a hub area before jumping into a match where up to eight players can participate at once. Usually, the victory condition is simply 'last man standing,' but in some cases, it may be required to band together and defeat a PvE boss. The game also implements Victory Points, which are not necessarily connected to direct combat, allowing for alternative playstyles. An event system was introduced to ensure matches would feature variations, such as a special enemy or bonus side objectives.</p>
<p>Lastly, Miyazaki-san outlined a role system that is still being finished. One player could choose the Destined Rivals role so that another player in that match would be designated as their rival; finding and defeating them would be a personal goal with its own rewards. On the other hand, Destined Companion requires a player to find another player who was randomly designated as their companion, which results in a special reward if they can form a bond.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that The Duskbloods sounds very interesting. It's just unfortunate that it'll be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2, similar to Bloodborne on PlayStation 4, instead of being available on all platforms like Dark Souls or Elden Ring. The game is currently slated for a 2026 launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-single-player-games-miyazaki-duskbloods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has gone on the record to put fans' fears to rest following the announcement of multiplayer Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>earlier this week.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Creators' Voice interview</a> with Nintendo about the game, Miyazaki says that despite multiplayer experiments like&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, FromSoftware has no plans to abandon its usual fare.</p>

<p>According to Miyazaki, these games "[don't] mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction", and that the company "still intend[s] to actively develop single-player focused games" like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>"that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromsoftware-single-player-games-the-duskbloods-wolf.jpg?itok=x4o4FkYS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromsoftware-single-player-games-the-duskbloods-wolf.jpg?itok=NObJ1Ezw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>FromSoftware isn't abandoning single-player games, so don't worry.</figcaption></figure><p>Miyazaki says that&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>was designed as a PvPvE multiplayer game because he's "always found the PvPvE structure very interesting". He goes on to say said structure allows FromSoftware to "leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters" in new ways.</p>

<p>He also provides some more info about&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>itself; you'll play as a vampire-like creature called a Bloodsworn, and you'll be competing with other Bloodsworn for "First Blood" amidst an apocalyptic event known as the Twilight of Humanity.</p>

<p>That's why you'll see a range of different technologies and time periods in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>; you can think of the game's world as a sort of societal version of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Dreg Heap, with various different times and places collapsing into one another.</p>

<p>Over the course of a match in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, you'll fight both other players and enemies in the environment to accrue Victory Points, and the player with the most Victory Points at the end of the match wins.</p>




<p>Miyazaki says that because he's "not much of a PvP person", he wanted to design a multiplayer game that could be played by those who aren't keen on PvP without depriving those players of a fair chance at winning.</p>

<p>We don't yet have a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but the game will be coming to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/The-Duskbloods-2789410.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sometime in 2026, and it won't represent the end of FromSoftware's single-player catalog either. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Go bananas with this promo code for an added discount.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The expensive price tag on its new games is one of the drawbacks of the Nintendo Switch 2, of which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-uk">preorders</a> have already been going live early (Amazon included). Luckily, ShopTo is taking the sting off for UK customers by allowing you to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXgxO?object_uuid=6f43f13b-ec4d-4f5b-8fc8-aa89900590a9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get Donkey Kong Bananza for only £63.50</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is still more than the £58.99 RRP for digital copies, it's the best price possible right now for those who want to <em>actually</em> own their games, and hold them in their hands like a newborn bab. This handy bargain comes as the result of using ShopTo's "SPRING" coupon code, which allows you and other future Nintendo Switch 2 players to knock 5% off various games, consoles, gift cards, and more across your order on the website. </p><div catalogid="4bd4b2ff-6a98-4c94-af67-60348d747390" id="218174"><div id="218174" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Release Date: July 17, 2025.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you use the code at checkout, £3.35 will be taken off so you'll only have to pay £63.50 instead of  £66.85. There is a catch, however. While you can preorder <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> to pay at dispatch normally, you'll only be allowed to use the discount code if you pay right away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, if you currently don't have the funds and weren't planning to pay until DK Bananza's 17th of July 2025 release date, this preorder deal sadly won't be ideal for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, if you manage to free up some cash, you can use the "SPRING" discount code also works for <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4m83?object_uuid=6f43f13b-ec4d-4f5b-8fc8-aa89900590a9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>, which is also for sale at ShopTo. Currently at £74.85, you can get £3.34 knocked off so you'll only have to pay £71.10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> bundled with a code for Mario Kart World is a great deal, essentially getting you a digital version of the game for around half the price, but any discounts on the game from retailers is also great for you physical collectors out there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The discount also works for the upcoming <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd7wpv?object_uuid=6f43f13b-ec4d-4f5b-8fc8-aa89900590a9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> over at ShopTo, but is currently sold out at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nevertheless, we'll be keeping an eye on it incase the retailer happens to add any more stock, so you can take advantage while the coupon's still active. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

They pointed to the lack of a price in the Direct itself as a "deliberate" omission that caused confusion and misinformation as fans scrambled to find out pricing confirmation elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 and Mario Kart World pricing was “intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason,” Yang claimed, “but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places and you’re expecting the fans or the consumer to piece it all together.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellis added: “It just shows some disrespect to the consumer, where, ‘oh, you just saw the Direct you’re so excited, you’re just gonna throw your money at us blindly, you’re not going to even ask the question of how much it cost because you’re so excited, aren’t you?’ "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s a little bit degrading almost to the intelligence of the consumer,” Yang said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The former NOA communications staff then went on to discuss Nintendo’s failure to address the pricing concern, either with a public statement or in interviews with the press. This, they said, was causing rampant speculation to fill the void with misinformation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They are enabling the story to get out of hand, out of control,” Yang said. “They have lost control of this,” Ellis added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what went wrong? Ellis and Yang suggested Nintendo now lacks the consumer mindfulness it once had, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/nintendos-reggie-fils-aime-retires-replacement-named">former NOA boss Reggie Fils-Aimé’s retirement</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/nintendo-ceo-satoru-iwata-has-passed-away">the tragic loss of former Nintendo head Satoru Iwata</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s communications team will now be recommending the company release an official statement, Yang said, but the approval process will be painful, with many people involved before it even gets to current Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will also be out of practice because it hasn’t spoken to its community or press in such a long time, the pair said, nor has it had to deal with this sort of negativity since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/03/nintendos-apology-for-3ds-price-cut">the Nintendo 3DS price debacle of 2011</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now there is concern for staff manning demo stations at the public-facing Switch 2 hands-on sessions. Fans will have reasonable questions at these public events and might put those to staff who are manning demo stations. If they respond with any sort of answer, that could end up online and framed as Nintendo’s official response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What happens next? It remains to be seen, but neither Ellis nor Yang expect a price drop of either the Switch 2 or its games before launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>From Software has two known games in development currently--with one set to be released very soon--and both of them are built around a core multiplayer experience. Elden Ring: Nightreign offers a co-op souls-like adventure, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-announces-the-duskbloods-a-new-rpg-exclusive-to-switch-2/1100-6530560/">The Duskbloods</a> is heavily focused on PvPvE gameplay. This has raised some concern amongst From Software fans that the studio will develop more multiplayer games in the future, but From Software boss and Duskbloods director Hidetaka Miyazaki says that

decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward," Miyazaki said in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">Nintendo interview</a>. "The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single-player-focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style."</p><p>Miyazaki also spoke more about the setting, characters, and themes of The Duskbloods, explaining how players will control a group of characters known as the Bloodsworn. Starring a group of superhuman warriors that are similar to vampires, Miyazaki said that the game takes place during the end of human society and revolves around the Bloodsworn chasing after something known as First Blood.

"Nightreign looks to be very much a From Software game, and I'm more intrigued by it now than I was before getting some time with it," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/">Elden Ring Nightreign preview</a>.</p>
