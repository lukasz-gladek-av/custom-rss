I love the moral conundrums it presents, the violent grief it depicts, and the games’ excellent writing that poignantly brings all of those complicated emotions to the surface. What I don’t like is listening to pretty much any of the creative team talk about the series, especially when it comes to weighing in on decade-long discourse around its complex storylines. Even when I agree with series director Neil Druckmann’s interpretation of something, we’d all rather he just let bad readings fester in the corners of the internet than tell us exactly what something means. Nevertheless, he continues to do so in interviews. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-fireflies-cure-joel-ellie-vaccine-could-make-1851781975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-fireflies-cure-joel-ellie-vaccine-could-make-1851781975">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-recommend-id="image://655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-recommend-id="image://655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647?_gl=1*gkben*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc2ODI3MTQkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzQ3NjgzOTExJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647?_gl=1*gkben*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc2ODI3MTQkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzQ3NjgzOTExJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span> is a very good game that animal lovers can enjoy because there’s no way to harm a single creature in the game (except for people, of course).

            <p>NetherRealm has confirmed there will be no more additional story chapters or characters "from this point on".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the studio said that despite "hearing players' requests for continued game support of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>", "there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released". It will, however, "continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes".</p>

<p>"It's disappointing because there's no thorough QoL, no online lobbies, &amp; locked away skins....you truly gave us an unfinished $140 game," <a href="https://x.com/Mikemetroid/status/1926025851734196480">replied</a> one player. "An extreme low from WB/NRS. What changed over there???"</p>
<p>As for that "next project" NetherRealm refers to? Well, no-one's entirely sure as it's not been formally confirmed as yet, but that's widely thought to be Injustice 3. Let's watch this space.</p>
<p>Some fans aren't surprised by the announcement, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-has-fans-thinking-warner-bros-has-quietly-wrapped-up-development">NetherRealm Studios released its surprise Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC earlier this month with minimal fanfare</a>, bundling together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a> at the time, a sentiment largely shared across the playerbase.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition costs £55/$70 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $60. There's also a £50/$60 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($50 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-army-set-preview-awoooo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The grimdark future of <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> is constantly evolving, and with each new edition comes the promise of refreshed armies and new tactical opportunities. For the Sons of Fenris, that promise is finally being delivered with the highly anticipated Space Wolves Army Set and Space Wolves Codex Supplement. Packing brand-new sculpts, the essential new Codex, and a suite of datacards designed to get you howling into battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’ve recently covered army sets from the warp with our reviews of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">World Eaters Army Set</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-death-guard-poxwrought-vector-review-so-sick" rel="nofollow">Death Guard Army Set</a>, so join us now as we take a sneak peek at this massive army set release.</p>

<h2><b>Space Wolves Army Set Contents</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-wolves-army-set-full-picture.jpg?itok=filYwPyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-wolves-army-set-full-picture.jpg?itok=HCoLMTHc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So what’s included in the Space Wolves Army Set? A lot!</p>

<ul><li>1x Wolf Guard Battle Leader</li>
	<li>1x Wolf Priest</li>
	<li>10 Grey Hunters</li>
	<li>10 Blood Claws</li>
	<li>6x Wolf Guard Headtakers</li>
	<li>1x Special Edition Codex</li>
	<li>25x Datacards</li>
	<li>1x Transfer Sheet</li>
</ul><p>Estimated MSRP: $230 USD</p>

<h2><b>Space Wolves Army Set - Special Edition Codex</b></h2>

<p>I really like the look of the Codex, and reading through it we get, as usual, a really great and extensive dive into the lore of this Chapter. From the start of the chapter on the death world of Fenris, to detailing how this Chapter battles with the ferocity of the wolves of their home planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also an extensive section in the lore describing the heraldry of the Chapter, as well as how each of the different “packs” of warriors (like the Blood Claws and Grey Hunters, which we’ll speak to in a moment). Finally, the Codex includes all the rules you need to play, including how Sagas work for this Chapter.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a Quick Look at the individual units included in this Army Set!</p>



<p>The new Space Wolves Army Set comes with five units all ready to hit the battlefield (after some assembly, of course) and fight until the Wolftime dawns! As opposed to one of our more in-depth reviews where we break down all the stats, for this Army Set preview I really want to just take a Quick Look at what makes each unit feel different from one another and special.</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Battle Leader</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=RPNs3_Vt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=X6xvQBgY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s start with the Wolf Guard Battle Leader - veterans of battle and some of the bravest warriors in the army. What makes this unit most unique is how customizable it is. You can choose from an array of melee weapons (a power weapon or a thunder hammer) and ranged options (Carbine, heavy bolt, or plasma pistol), and as a leader you can attach this unit to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers.</p>

<p>When you set them up as a leader, you give their unit the Sustained Hits 1 keyword and let them re-roll 1’s when you’re attacking within 6 inches. Not bad for a melee-happy Chapter like the wolves!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Priest</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=TtWVfNLJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=V0r4gklv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is the Wolf Priest, the physical and spiritual leader of the group. And while they’re outfitted with decent weaponry, their abilities truly make the Wolf Priest an extreme standout.</p>

<p>You can attach them to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers, and as they act as leaders you’ll get two special abilities. First, you’ve got the Litany of Hate ability, which says if the Priest is leading a unit they add 1 to wound rolls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the real prize here, and what makes the Wolf Priest stand out, is the Healing Balms ability, which says “While this model is leading a unit, in your Command phase, you can return 1 destroyed model (excluding Character models) to that unit.” That’s not a once-per-battle thing, which is huge!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Headtakers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=UtiqqE40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=JGQ1VlUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Wolf Guard Headtakers are tasked with breaking through enemy lines and taking down important figures in the enemy camp. To do that, they’re joined by their ferocious Hunting Wolves!</p>

<p>What makes this unit special is that, at the start of your deploy units phase, you actually split this unit up into two units - one for the marines and the other for the wolves! This unit can also can name one enemy unit as their quarry which gives the marine models in this unit Devastating Wounds and Precision keywords tied to attacking their quarry!</p>

<h3><b>Grey Hunters and Blood Claws</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=NCnjymrg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=HU7kOajz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Blood Claws</figcaption></figure><p>Blood Claws are the youngest members of the Chapter, hungry to prove themselves in savage battle. Contrasting that are the Grey Hunters, who are older, more mature, and patient marines. These are two different units, but they each only have one thing making them each stand out - beyond the impressive weaponry of your standard space marine.</p>

<p>For the Blood Claws, their fiery and impatient nature is brought to life via their Berserk Charge ability, which let’s them charge in the same turn it Advanced, meaning these marines can cover some serious ground.</p>

<p>For the Grey Hunters, their stalking nature is portrayed in the Cunning Hunters ability, which let’s them re-roll Wound rolls of 1 and, if they’re within range of an object marker, the ability is upgraded to allow them to re-roll all Wound rolls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=nzLq0QHV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=Kldmcjxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Gray Pack</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the Codex, Codex Cards - which do a great job of making it super easy to keep track of your units - and the models, this feels like a very solid offering, and similar to other Space Marine Army Boxes we’ve seen since the launch of 10th. I’ve got some playtesting to do with these models, but on first look - I think you could use this box as the start of an extremely aggressive Force!</p>

Basically: a Very Confident Man was doing his own bathroom reno, and despite the best advice from… everyone speaking to him, made a succession of terrible decisions, many stylistic, others load-bearing (like weakening the floor beneath the tub). It became so notorious that in 2019<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-hot-new-doom-mod-is-a-nightmare-diy-bathroom-renovation-bathdoom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a Doom mod was made to commemorate the job</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Something Awful | bEatmstrJ</figcaption></figure><p>Anyway time moved on, the bathroom was completed,<a href="https://aftermath.site/escape-to-the-country-tv-series-review-from-the-circles-of-hell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we found other fucked up houses to focus our attention on</a> and got on with our lives. The Doom Bathroom was filed away in our memory banks, where like so many Jokes Of A Time I would have expected it to remain.</p><p>But no! It's now back! Because the house the Doom Bathroom emerged from the depths of hell to take residence in<a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/25380-Coral-Canyon-Rd-Corona-CA-92883/79835564_zpid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is currently up for sale</a>. For just $1,088,000, you could live in this "uniquely remodeled home", which upstairs--provided you equip a chainsaw and are aware that at some point you're going to need to rip and/or tear--features a "master bathroom [that] has been fully transformed with a sleek, modern design that stands out from the rest".</p><p>It really does stand out! The rest of the house is absolutely not to my taste, but it is at least consistently to <em>a</em> taste, in the way so many other American homes built (or renovated)<a href="https://mcmansionhell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> over the last 20 years are</a>. You could click through 94% of this gallery and think this was a normal, boring, house, were it not for the three photos in the middle that show a completely unrelated <em>bathroom from hell</em>.</p><p>If you've never seen the house before please check it out. And while you're there, maybe an American familiar with real estate listings could tell me why every exterior photos looks like a cel-shaded screenshot from a Telltale adventure game.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone"><h3>The Most Popular Window Air Conditioner Has Disappeared From Store Shelves</h3></a><p>The Midea U-Shaped air conditioner is universally beloved.

                <p dir="ltr">AMD announced its latest graphics card, the Radeon RX 9060 X, at Computex 2025 earlier this week. This is the third GPU in AMD's 9000 series lineup that also includes the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, and its slated to launch June 5. While it's positioned as the entry-level option in the RX 9000 series, the RX 9060 XT runs on the same RNDA 4 architecture as the more powerful RX 9070 and 9070 XT and includes FSR 4 resolution upscaling and frame generation, as well as DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b support. </p><p dir="ltr">AMD is producing two versions of the RX 9060 XT: one with 8GB VRAM and another with 16GB VRAM. Both models will feature 32 RDNA 4 CUs (computation units), up to 3.13GHz clock speed, and between 150W and 182W power draw, depending on the model's VRAM and clock speed. While those are solid specs for an entry-level card, things get a bit more confusing from there.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Power and pricing</h2><p dir="ltr">AMD lists the MSRP as $300 for the 8GB model and $350 for the 16GB model. However, the company is not releasing RX 9060 XT reference cards itself. Instead, third-party manufacturers like Asus, Acer, Gigabyte, and others are launching their own versions of the RX 9060 XT starting June 5. As such, performance, power draw, and pricing will likely differ between the various RX 9060 XT models (especially for overclocked models), but at least some of these GPUs will stick to the reference clock speeds and therefore MSRP (assuming the ongoing tariffs do not impact those prices).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190"></a><figcaption>Asus is launching three RX 9060 XT models</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for performance, the RX 9060 XT 16GB is positioned as the replacement for AMD's RX 7600 XT as its flagship entry-level GPU, making it the primary competitor to Nvidia's $300 GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (which costs either $380 for the 8GB version or $429 for the 16GB version). According to AMD's Computex 2025 presentation, the company's internal testing found the RX 9060 XT is roughly six percent faster than the RTX 5060 Ti on 40 games running at 1440p--and at roughly $80 MSRP cheaper. However, those tests compare the RX 9060 XT 16GB to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, rather than the RTX 5060 16GB. The RX 9060 8GB model's performance is a bigger question, as the smaller amount of VRAM could lead to significant performance dips.</p><p dir="ltr">On X (formerly Twitter), AMD's Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Gaming Marketing, Frank Azor, explained that most players use a 1080p display, for which 8GB of VRAM is more than enough. While technically true, it doesn't alleviate the concerns over confusing consumers who may see the above comparisons of the RX 9060 XT 16GB's 6% performance boost over the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and assume that applies to <em>all </em>RX 9060 XT models. And again, the actual performance will likely differ between the various SKUs launching June 5, which could further compound the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory. Most played games WW are mostly esports games. We wouldn't build it if there wasn't a market for it. If 8GB isn't right for you then there's 16GB. Same GPU, no compromise, just memory…</p>  — Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find the AMD RX 9060 XT</h2><p dir="ltr">Those potential concerns and unanswered questions aside, the RX 9060 XT nevertheless looks like a solid entry-level choice for those already invested in AMD's hardware. As mentioned above, multiple manufacturers are releasing RX 9060 XT GPUs starting June 5, and while none are currently listed for preorder, you can learn more about the models announced from <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9060xt-o16g/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus</a>, <a href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/components/graphics-cards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/All-Series?fid=3124" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte</a>, at each company's online store. Other brands like PowerColor also showed off upcoming RX 9060 XT GPUs on the Computex 2025 show floor. We'll be sure to update this post once the GPUs are available.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-board-game-monkey-palace-strategy-building-set-amazon-deal-2025/1100-6528660/">Lego Monkey Palace Board Game Is Over 50% Off At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-leverless-arcade-controller-xbox-switch-2-pc-preorder-amazon/1100-6531585/">8BitDo Reveals Leverless Arcade Controllers For PC, Switch, And Xbox</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>   </ul> </div>

It <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014734/Biofeedback-in-Gameplay-How-Valve">began over a decade ago</a> with in-house psychologists studying people’s biological responses to video games; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2947088/valve-reveals-secret-hardware-project-wearable-computing">Valve once considered earlobe monitors</a> for its first VR headset. The company publicly explored the idea of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhj3C1H5JWo">brain-computer interfaces for gaming</a> at GDC in 2019.</p><p>But Newell decided to spin off the idea. That same year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125379/is-gabe-newells-neuralink-competitor-coming-out-of-stealth">he quietly incorporated</a> a new brain-computer interface startup, Starfish Neuroscience — which has now revealed plans to produce its very first brain chip later this year.</p><p><a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/blog/ultra-low-power-miniature-electrophysiological-electronics/?header-bg=card-bg0">Starfish’s first blog post</a>, spotted <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1925459695713525986">by Valve watcher Brad Lynch</a>, makes it clear we’re not talking about a complete implant yet. This bit is the custom “electrophysiology” chip designed to record brain activity (like how Neuralink can “read your mind” so patients can interact with computers) and stimulate the brain (for disease therapy), but Starfish isn’t claiming it’s already built the systems to power it or the bits to stick it into a person’s head.</p><p>“We anticipate our first chips arriving in late 2025 and <strong>we are interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues</strong>,” writes Starfish neuroengineer Nate Cermak (bolding theirs), suggesting that Starfish might wind up partnering with other companies for wireless power or even the final brain implant.</p><p>But the goal, writes Starfish, is a smaller and less invasive implant than the competition, one that can “enable simultaneous access to multiple brain regions” instead of just one site, and one that doesn’t require a battery. Using just 1.1 milliwatts during “normal recording,” Starfish says it can work with wireless power transmission instead.</p><p>Here’s the chip’s current spec sheet:</p><div><ul><li><span>Low power: 1.1 mW total power consumption during normal recording </span></li><li><span>Physically small: 2 x 4mm (0.3mm pitch BGA) </span></li><li><span>Capable of both recording (spikes and LFP) &amp; stimulation (biphasic pulses) </span></li><li><span>32 electrode sites, 16 simultaneous recording channels at 18.75kHz </span></li><li><span>1 current source for stimulating on arbitrary pairs of electrodes </span></li><li><span>Onboard impedance monitoring and stim voltage transient measurement </span></li><li><span>Digital onboard data processing and spike detection allows the device to operate via low-bandwidth wireless interfaces. </span></li><li><span>Fabricated in TSMC 55nm process</span></li></ul></div><p>Neuralink’s N1, for comparison, has 1,024 electrodes across its 64 brain-implanted threads, <a href="http://whole ASIC consumes approximately 6 mW">a chip that consumed around 6 milliwatts as of 2019</a>, a battery that periodically needs wireless charging, and the full implant (again, not just the chip) is around 23mm wide and 8mm thick. The Elon Musk-led company has reportedly already implanted it in three humans; while some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152758/neuralinks-first-implant-in-a-human-started-to-detach-from-the-patients-brain">threads did detach</a> from the first patient’s brain, he still has functionality and <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/full-q-and-a-neuralink-patient-noland">has been giving interviews</a>.</p><p>Starfish says it could be important to connect to multiple parts of the brain simultaneously, instead of just one region, to address issues like Parkinson’s disease. “there is increasing evidence that a number of neurological disorders involve circuit-level dysfunction, in which the interactions between brain regions may be misregulated,” Cermak writes.</p><p>In addition to multiple simultaneous brain implants, <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/research/">the company’s updated website says</a> it’s working on a “precision hyperthermia device” to destroy tumors with targeted heat, and a brain-reading, robotically guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system for addressing neurological conditions like bipolar disorder and depression.</p><p>In case you’re wondering how any of this might make its way back to gaming, I’ll leave you with Valve’s talk from GDC 2019 about brain-computer interfaces.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There are a lot of different jobs to choose from in The Sims 4, including a pretty robust group of careers included with the base game and plenty more that have been added via DLC over the decade-plus that The Sims 4 has been out. What jobs you have your sims sign up for is totally up to you, but there are a lot of factors that can affect your performance, like whether your sim's skills are appropriate for the job you want. If you want your sims to be successful, some knowledge and effort are required--just like it is with a real job.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are specific things you'll need to know about each individual career that can help you get ahead, there are also some universal tips that can help your sims climb their corporate ladders.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</a><ul><li><a href="#Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</a></li><li><a href="#Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</a></li><li><a href="#Get_career_related_reward_perks">Get career-related reward perks</a></li><li><a href="#Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</a></li><li><a href="#Work_overtime">Work overtime</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Astronaut">Astronaut</a></li><li><a href="#Athlete">Athlete</a></li><li><a href="#Business">Business</a></li><li><a href="#Criminal">Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#Culinary">Culinary</a></li><li><a href="#Entertainer">Entertainer</a></li><li><a href="#Painter">Painter</a></li><li><a href="#Secret_Agent">Secret Agent</a></li><li><a href="#Tech_Guru">Tech Guru</a></li><li><a href="#Writer">Writer</a></li><li><a href="#Critic">Critic</a></li><li><a href="#Politician">Politician</a></li><li><a href="#Social_Media">Social Media</a></li><li><a href="#Conservationist">Conservationist</a></li><li><a href="#Gardener">Gardener</a></li><li><a href="#Freelancer">Freelancer</a></li><li><a href="#Military">Military</a></li><li><a href="#Education">Education</a></li><li><a href="#Engineer">Engineer</a></li><li><a href="#Law">Law</a></li><li><a href="#Style_Influencer">Style Influencer</a></li><li><a href="#Salaryperson">Salaryperson</a></li><li><a href="#Civil_Designer">Civil Designer</a></li><li><a href="#Romance_Consultant">Romance Consultant</a></li><li><a href="#Undertaker">Undertaker</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_active_careers">All Sims 4 active careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Doctor">Doctor</a></li><li><a href="#Detective">Detective</a></li><li><a href="#Scientist">Scientist</a></li><li><a href="#Retail">Retail</a></li><li><a href="#Interior_Decorator">Interior Decorator</a></li><li><a href="#Reaper">Reaper</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</h3><p dir="ltr">There are three main types of careers in The Sims 4. Most of them are rabbit hole-type jobs, where your sims just go offscreen and do their thing without any meaningful input from the player. But there are also "active" careers, where you follow your sim to their place of business and you'll have to make them do various tasks (though you can also play these as rabbit hole jobs if you'd prefer), and self-employment and freelance careers where your sim will complete individual gigs from the comfort of their homes, like writing a book, painting a picture, or building furniture.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</h3><p dir="ltr">Teens who get good grades in high school will automatically earn a career level or two in any job they take--a B GPA starts you at level 2 of every career your sim joins for the rest of their lives, and an A will let them start at the third tier. Likewise, there are specific college degrees that will help both your starting level and your performance--we'll note those below.</p><p dir="ltr">In your lifetime aspiration rewards, there are some perks you can purchase that will help a lot with any career you take on. Professional Slacker (4000 reward points) will make it so you'll never lose your job or get demoted for bad performance, and the Connections trait will make it so you start any career three levels higher than you normally would--this stacks with any bonuses you earned in high school or college as well. The Savant perk (4000 points), which increases all skill gains by 25%, will also help, as most jobs have specific skill requirements for promotions.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</h3><p dir="ltr">For the most part, the job will tell you exactly what it is your sim needs to do to get ahead. Most jobs will require you to complete certain tasks while you're off the clock (homework, basically) or increase certain skills in order to earn a promotion--whatever those requirements are will be listed in the career tab in the bottom right corner of the screen. Likewise, active careers will have random tasks for your sims while they're at the office, and if you don't do at least some of them each day, you'll end up making very little money.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Work_overtime">Work overtime</h3><p dir="ltr">Some jobs allow your sim to stay two hours past the normal end of their shift, which improves their job performance and earns them overtime pay. Using that option whenever it's available can advance your career much more quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, you'll also want to level up each career's relevant skills and make sure your sim is in the best mood for the job whenever possible. To help you with that, below you'll find a list of each of the normal and active careers in The Sims 4, along with a rundown on the relevant skills, ideal moods, and which college degrees are most relevant. Follow this guide, and no matter which career you put your sim in, they'll be raking in the cash and vacation days in no time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-roblox-grow-a-garden-geoguessr<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better and, often, worse, traditional video games have calcified. If you check Steam’s top ten most-played games on any given day, you’ll likely find a lineup of the usual suspects: <em>PUBG</em>, <em>DOTA</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, and the odd recent breakout hit (with a major license attached) like <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Across the way, on their own clients, you’ll find mirror realm versions of the aforementioned games like <em>Fortnite, Valorant, </em>and <em>League of Legends</em>. But then, in another universe, there’s <em>Roblox</em>, which plays by its own, different set of rules. This week, its latest crop to yield viral fruit, <em>Grow A Garden</em>, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made headlines</a> by outpacing anything on Steam. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss how it and other games of its ilk offer young people something that more traditional games don’t.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath’s newest regular contributor</a>, former Polygon senior reporter Nicole Carpenter to discuss her tenure at <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the freshly gutted games media institution</a>, as well as how she got into journalism in the first place. She also tells us about the time she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23776996/barbie-fashion-designer-retro-game-untold-story-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to speak to the voice of Barbie for a story</a>, and she started speaking in character without even being asked. You love to hear it.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we delve into the news of the week: First, the community around Google Maps-based location guessing game <em>GeoGuessr </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protested the game’s inclusion in the Saudi-backed Esports World Cup</a> by blacking out most of the game’s most popular maps… and it worked? Despite the prevailing mentality that corporate interests and oil money will overcome all, <em>GeoGuessr</em>’s developers relented and pulled out of the event. We talk about the ways in which this situation was unique, but conclude that it can still serve as an inspiration to other gaming communities unnerved by the sudden presence of a&nbsp; sportswashing festival on their annual calendars.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to <em>Grow A Garden</em>, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a <em>Roblox </em>game Nicole wrote about</a> that has more concurrent players than anything on Steam. Why is it so popular? And what is <em>Roblox </em>offering young people that more traditional games don’t? Lastly, we accept an offer from the King Of All Cosmos and transform Aftermath into a giant ball company.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can roll up the first giant ball with a second, giant-er ball.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>It really is just… you grow a garden. It has the typical <em>Roblox </em>look: It kinda looks like Legos. You’re buying seeds and planting the seeds. You’re waiting a little bit for the seeds to grow; you don’t actually have to wait very long. And then you’re selling those so you can go buy more seeds and then plant them in your garden and sell them. You do that over and over and over and over.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that I think draws people to it is that there’s an RNG element. Your crops can mutate. They can become really rare, so you can get a lot of money. But basically, at its core, it’s watching a number go up, which, you know, universal game activity that draws people back.</p><p>There is a social aspect to it: You can have five people per server, all in what is not dissimilar to a community garden. You each have your own plots, and you’re hanging out. There’s events that happen there. The developer has his global commands; he can make stuff happen in the game. They do dance parties. They’re doing one this weekend: the Monster Mash. And they do lightning bolts, mutate your crops – special stuff like that.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first started playing it for this story, I was baffled. It’s so simple. It’s so heavily monetized. You can play it without buying anything, but if you want to steal from another person, you have to pay. It’s less than a dollar, which I think can be pretty insidious. That’s a <em>Roblox </em>thing in general: Everything is so cheap that you don’t really realize how it adds up. But as I kept playing, I was like “Is this good?” It’s really satisfying and built around viral moments on short-form platforms like YouTube Shorts or TikTok. There are older people, like people my age, playing it, but it’s a lot of gen alpha.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What about it lends itself especially well to viral moments? When somebody goes viral playing this game, what is happening?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicole:</strong> What I’ve seen is people stealing from each other. If you’ve been playing this a lot, you can get really rare stuff – stuff that for me as a beginner player is totally not accessible. So stealing it, you’re literally picking their plant or whatever and selling it for your own money. There are ways to protect yourself, but it’s funny when someone accidentally forgets to protect that thing, and they get their prize crop stolen. And these videos also have a lot of screaming. Typical TikTok things. That’s largely where I’m seeing the viral moments.</p><p>When I interviewed the dev, he was saying that all those five million people aren’t necessarily playing the game; they’re joining this low-stakes thing for these events to be part of the thing. It’s so easy to plant a few crops. It’s so low stakes and low investment that it’s easy for people to be like “I’m gonna try that out” or “I’ll play it” or “This will become my new social space.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Luke, you were talking about this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lppoyvczec2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yeah, it’s funny watching this game blow up, because they’re all largely the same thing. If you’re not familiar with <em>Roblox</em> – and I’m assuming that’s most of you, and you’re better for it – my son spends all of his time on <em>Roblox</em>, so I’ve developed an unnatural understanding of how it all works and operates and what the appeal is. Like Nicole was saying, these are barely games. What’s important to understand here is, they are social experiences that these large groups of similar-aged kids log onto, and they’re kinda doing it in the background, and a number’s going up, and something is happening that’s making them feel good, but at the same time, nine of their friends from school are in chat, and it’s a space where they’re hanging out.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is happening, but there’s actually not much game. It’s like guys watching football. The game’s on, but there’s really seven people having a beer and catching up. It’s that, but for 12 year-olds – with some deeply problematic structures built into the platform. Although I guess sports have that too with sports gambling and alcoholism. [<em>Roblox</em>] has crippling monetization and the normalization of gambling and stuff built into it.</p><p>But yeah, it’s been funny watching people grapple with this game’s popularity, because it shows that they don’t deal with <em>Roblox </em>on a daily basis. This game blew up, but it kinda only blew up a little more than any other game that is blowing up on a given day in <em>Roblox</em>. Next week, <em>Grow A Garden </em>might have disappeared completely and be replaced with <em>Weightlifting Guy Simulator</em> or–</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <em>Sisyphus Simulator 4</em>.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> It’s just so funny watching people [try to figure out why these games get big]. And I’m guilty of this myself; I used to write about <em>Roblox </em>at Kotaku, and I used to grossly misrepresent it because honestly, it was very difficult to understand as a normal adult who didn’t have to experience it on a regular basis. But now that I’ve had to spend time with it, it’s so funny watching people grapple with it, because it’s so foreign to how so many of us understand how video games operate – how we operate within them and what we get out of them. <em>Roblox </em>is just on such a completely different level.&nbsp;</p><p>“Why are they playing this terrible game?” Dude, they’re barely playing it. Stop thinking of this as a video game. It’s social lubricant. My 12-year-old son… the pandemic fucked my kids up badly, because they had to spend two or three years doing school work from home on and off and having all their social events curtailed and missing important events. Those were formative years of their life, and so suddenly kids of that age – I’ve got a 14 year-old and a 12 year-old – have just learned to be online during some of their most formative social years in ways that go well beyond what any of us would associate with that. They’ll have friends that live in this suburb that they could go and visit, and they don’t. They sit on <em>Roblox </em>or Snapchat with them, because that’s been normalized to them.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are deeply problematic aspects to <em>Roblox</em>, we let him keep playing because a) we control the spend, and b) he’s getting a lot out of it. It’s not a bad video game for him. It’s just the place where he hangs out with his friends. I think that’s way better than him just sort of lying in his room watching TV or whatever. He’s always actively talking to them and communicating, and they’re always plotting strategies and doing stuff we would associate with gaming; you’d do that playing <em>Halo </em>on a couch or playing <em>FIFA</em>. But they’re all doing it every day in ways that are really healthy.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone"><h3>The Most Popular Window Air Conditioner Has Disappeared From Store Shelves</h3></a><p>The Midea U-Shaped air conditioner is universally beloved.

Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide soon after launch. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> on the official Mortal Kombat social media account, Warner Bros. acknowledged the disappointment the news will cause players, "but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. failed to say what this new project is, but current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm’s DC fighting game series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>We are hearing players’ requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1, and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character, which came a year-and-a-half after the release of Mortal Kombat 1 itself, now goes down as the game’s final major content drop. For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. Today’s announcement comes one year and eight months after the release of Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are already bringing up prior comments from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon, who had promised fans years of support. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from Boon</u></a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: “NetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now"><u>Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</u></a>, the pink ninja developer Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What now for Mortal Kombat? Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated that it still believes the gory fighting game franchise has a future. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which was Mortal Kombat</u></a>. Movie adaptation Mortal Kombat 2 is due out later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>We're only a few weeks into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season, but since the season is only five weeks long, that means we're already getting close to the end. Once Star Wars season wraps up, things will be back to normal in Battle Royale and Zero Build--or maybe there's nothing normal at all about what's coming up next season.</p><p>Right now we've got a lot more questions (about 7,000) than we do answers (about 0) regarding what's in store for the Fortnite island once all these Star Wars people leave, but let's go through the rumors and guesswork we've got so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</a></li><li><a href="#Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</a></li><li><a href="#New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't have a confirmed answer for this question right now, but since the Star Wars season is designated in the game's metadata as Chapter 6 MS1 (mini-season 1), it stands to reason that next season will be called Season 3. It also implies, but <em>does not confirm,</em> plans for an additional mini-seasons in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite: Galactic Battle is currently scheduled to come to a close on June 7, with the new season slated to begin on the morning of June 8. But this season won't end in the middle of the night, as most Fortnite seasons do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</h2><p dir="ltr">As promised by Epic when the season began, the Star Wars Galactic Battle season will conclude with a live event in which players will storm the Death Star and confront Emperor Palpatine in order to end the Empire's invasion of the island. This will be a true live event, like the ones that come at the end of each chapter, and it'll take place on Saturday, June 7 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's rumored that the upcoming season of Battle Royale <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be superhero themed</a>, but in the more traditional capes-and-tights sort of way--with Midas running a school for superheroes, apparently. Word is that the new season will have a DC Comics bent, which makes sense with a new Superman film landing in July. And since Fortnite's only existing Superman skin is permanently locked behind the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass from 2021, the rumors about <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1918704607083282696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new item shop Superman</a> make perfect sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</h2><p dir="ltr">It's expected that the new season will have a normal battle pass that includes several Fortnite-original characters and one or two collab skins. It's very likely that a new corrupted version of Daigo will be on the pass, since the cinematic at the end of Season 2 showed Daigo entering the magic portal in the northeasern part of the island and transforming into a very different body. Beyond that, the only rumored collab skin for the battle pass <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is Robin</a>--yes, we're talking about Batman's pal here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</h2><p dir="ltr">All the rumors and leaks about the upcoming season being superhero-themed also mention that <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1921999441885577714" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superpowers will be a</a> key part <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920524099136467202" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of your arsenal</a> in the new season. Not gadgets like we had in last year's Marvel season, but rather actual super-powered abilities--stuff like the mythic Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball items, or Avatar's elemental abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 of Fortnite OG will also begin on June 8, and that may be because the original Season 4 also had a superhero theme. While Fortnite OG will certainly stick with the loot pool and map that the original Season 4 had, we can't help but wonder if there will be story connections between OG and standard Battle Royale given the simultaneous start dates.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Epic has seemingly been teasing the return of The Visitor, whose arrival with the meteor in the original Season 4 kicked off Fortnite's plot, with <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1920631430188568835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this remix of an old Seven-related music track</a> that appears to have a modified version of The Visitor's head and shoulders on the cover art. The Visitor would have been a prime candidate for a remix even without that tease, so no one would be surprised if he appeared on the new OG Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</h2><p dir="ltr">The new Lego Pass will <em>also</em> begin on June 8, and we have no rumors or anything about what's in store. But given the date, we have every reason to expect it will tie in with this hypothetical superhero theme. Given DC's close relationship with Lego, it wouldn't be surprising at all for one of that brand's heroes to pop up here.</p>

            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has had an unexpectedly strong start for a sequel to a fairly obscure 13-year Nintendo DS game. And developer Level 5 has now thanked fans for their enthusiasm, pledging to release free DLC in response to its "global success".
</p>
<p>
The Girl Who Steals Time, for context, is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".
</p>
<p>
But in this post-Stardew Valley world - where you can't watch an indie showcase without seeing a dozen new village sims jostling for attention - the newly released Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals seems to resonated with audiences. It's garnered a positive early critical reception and even surpassed 45K concurrents on its first day on Steam (that's more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> managed) - and Level 5 is now celebrating its launch with news of more to come.

"Due to the game's global success and the warm support from players around the world," it <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">wrote in a message on its website</a>, "we have decided to release a free DLC that includes new recipes as well as expanded content under the title 'Update the World!'."
</p>
<p>
Level 5 hasn't shared much in the way of specifics, but it promises "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources", as well as "even more opportunities [for players] to showcase their gear". The studio says it's working to release the DLC "as soon as possible", and will provide further details at a later date. It sounds like there's even more on the way too; "We will continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i," it adds, "so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time." 
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-ps20-million-to-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at Games Workshop are getting a pay bonus. Despite the tabletop industry being highly volatile due to reckless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> disrupting trade and imports, the UK-based studio has reported growth. Growth that will be given to its staff.</p>

<h2>The Games Workshop Windfall</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/warhammer-games-workshop-staff-payout-b2756495.html" rel="nofollow">The Independent</a>, Games Workshop will be distributing bonus payments to its staff drawn from profits. These bonus payments will be distributed on an equal basis to each member of the staff. The studio, most well-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000 </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em></a>, stated the payout was in recognition of its employees' contributions to financial performance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=QoeV3s9Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SlKjeshh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That performance has led to a £20 million windfall for the company, demonstrating strong sales and growth. This is a notable increase from last year, which saw £18 million shared among the staff for stellar performance. Considering other tabletop studios have either shut down or have filed lawsuits in response to current events, this report of growth is unexpected.</p>

<p>As for how much that&nbsp;£20 million will break down among the Games Workshop staff, that is harder to parse. GW doesn't disclose how many employees they have, but it is believed they have 1,500 employees in their home base in Nottingham. Assuming that number is correct, that would mean each employee may be getting about £13k in pay bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the staff number cited doesn't take into account global employees, either in offices outside the UK or working online.</p>

<p>A major factor in Games Workshop's growth are its licensed video games. These include ongoing support for Owlcat Games' RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</em></a> and Saber Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a>. This is in addition to strong sales and ongoing support for the company's many tabletop miniatures games.</p>

<p>The growth of Games Workshop may not be slowing down anytime soon. The company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/amazon-warhammer-40000-film-contract-signed-production-can-now-begin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">partnered with Amazon</a> and Vertigo Entertainment to produce official movies and TV shows set within the grimdark sci-fi world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Better still, the production has the star power of Henry Cavill on board.</p>

The <em>Chrono Trigger</em>-like <em>Sea of Stars</em> is currently $22.75 (around 30 percent off), but just got a big free <em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em> DLC that adds a new eight-hour quest, additional character, and more classes. <em>Labyrinth of the Demon King, </em>meanwhile, is a lo-fi horror dungeon crawler that just came out last week and is already turning heads. It’s $16 this week (20 percent off). If you’re interested in what might end up on the list of 2025's most overlooked games, I’d give this one a shot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review.1197825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When the original Parks released in 2019, it quickly became a modern classic, thanks in large part to its gorgeous artwork celebrating the U.S. National Parks. See our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-board-game-review">review</a> for details on that first edition. But Keymaster Games didn’t just slap a fresh coat of paint on the 2nd Edition and call it a day. Instead, it thoughtfully combined the base game with its expansions, streamlining the gameplay, updating the visuals, and introducing new features, all while preserving that cozy game feel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is something that feels like both a sequel and a revision. Either way, the 2nd Edition of Parks is a great excuse to hit the trails, snap some photos, and fill your canteen all over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="04f06aa9-6449-4d2e-9c89-8b6612131675" id="220791"><div id="220791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Parks (2nd Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the original version, the second edition of Parks comes in a beautifully designed box packed with components that live up to its iconic design. Right on top, you'll find a textured, high-quality rulebook that's easy to follow and includes a QR code that links to a helpful video if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks is relatively straightforward to play, it includes a wide variety of components. Two log-shaped containers hold the game's colorful wooden tokens, representing the resources you'll collect while hiking the trail. Beneath those is a tri-fold game board with clearly marked spaces to guide you easily through setup. The game board has been completely redesigned and expanded, with an all-new permanent trail area, canteen tile drafting section, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real standout is the built-in storage tray at the bottom of the box, which is the best I’ve seen across the 60-plus board games I own. Everything has its place, from tokens and tiles to dice and cards, all packed efficiently to keep the game’s footprint compact, while making cleanup a breeze. The tray holds decks for the Parks, Gear, Passion, Ranger Teddy, and Volunteer Projects cards, along with solo reference cards, Season and Campsite tiles, Photo and Hiker tokens, Trail Site tiles, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player gets a board featuring an empty backpack and water bottle, with clearly marked sections around the edges for organizing visited and reserved parks, purchased gear, and more. The Backpack holds up to 12 resources, while the water bottle has six spaces for Canteen tiles you can fill as you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest updates in the 2nd Edition is the expanded card set, which now includes <em>all</em> 63 U.S. National Parks, up from 48 in the original. The cards feature all-new artwork and clean iconography that better matches the game's updated, more colorful design. While some fans may miss the original illustrations from the <a href="https://59parks.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifty-Nine Parks print series</a>, the new art feels more cohesive and fits well with the rest of the game’s style. Each card includes the park’s name, founding date, and a short blurb about what makes it unique.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions. The goal is simple: score the most points by hiking the trail, visiting parks, snapping photos, and completing optional objectives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, each player takes a pair of hikers and the matching player board. They also receive a random Canteen token, placed on their board, and a Campfire token flipped to its lit side if playing with more than three players. Each player is then dealt two Passion cards and chooses one to keep, discarding the other. Lastly, the First Hiker token is given to the designated starting player.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Passion cards provide small thematic goals to chase during the game, such as visiting parks with specific icons, using Wildlife tokens to take photos, or buying Gear from the item shop. Once completed, you can flip the card to choose one of two rewards: an ongoing effect that lasts the rest of the game, or an endgame bonus that adds extra points to your final score. Some Passions are easier to complete than others, and I usually leaned toward the endgame bonuses as those extra points were often the difference between winning and losing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round in Parks takes place during one of three seasons: spring, summer, or fall. All three seasons are drawn randomly at the start of the game and each offers a unique bonus, such as rewarding players for collecting the most of a specific resource or visiting parks with certain icons. While spring and summer don’t grant any extra points, the fall season awards three bonus points to the winner, making it especially appealing. Players can choose to ignore these objectives, but they offer useful incentives if they align with your goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On their turn, players move one of their two hikers forward along the trail, collecting resources or performing the action on the Trail Site tile above the space they land on. Since you can only move forward toward Trail’s End, careful planning is key. Trail Site tiles can offer specific resources like sun, water, forest, and mountain; let you buy Gear from the item shop; allow you either to take a photo by exchanging any resource or add a token to your Canteen; roll the Trail Die for a random bonus; or trade any resource for a Wildlife token (which, fittingly, acts as a wild resource token). Every tile is shuffled each season to keep things fresh and unpredictable, except the Parks space, which is permanently located in the middle of the trail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing on the Parks space lets you either reserve a park or visit one by paying its resource cost. If you have enough resources, you can even visit multiple parks on the same turn, making this space crucial for scoring points. Because of that, it’s often the most hotly-contested spot on the board. Thankfully, there’s no limit to how many parks you can reserve, and no penalty for not visiting them before the game ends. However, since you can’t reserve and visit in the same action, each choice on this space carries real weight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em> Many Trail Sites offer one-time bonus resources, so players are racing to grab what they can before others beat them to it. Since each Trail Site is unique each season, and you can't share a space with another player (including yourself) unless you use a lit campfire, every decision matters. You might skip ahead to grab a key resource or reach a specific site, but doing so means sacrificing everything you passed along the way, with no chance to go back until the following season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement games</a>, the real strategy in Parks comes from using both of your hikers in tandem to block opponents from collecting key resources or taking valuable actions. In higher player count games, the trail can get crowded fast, so refreshing your campfire to share spaces becomes essential. In lower player count games, there’s more room to breathe, allowing you to slow down and hit more spots along the trail. When a player reaches the Trail’s End, they choose one of three actions: take the Parks action, pay any resource to take a photo, or buy Gear. The first hiker to arrive at each space also gets a one-time bonus, adding an incentive to rush the trail. This constant push and pull between slowing down to gather resources and racing ahead for rewards is the real special sauce that makes Parks shine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because your Backpack can only hold 12 resources, you need to manage your inventory carefully by spending resources when possible, or you risk having to discard valuable ones at the end of your turn. The Canteen, by contrast, offers flexible bonuses whenever you collect water. Instead of placing the water in your Backpack, you can slot it into a Canteen to gain a resource or perform an action, depending on what you’ve collected. Some tiles even grant powerful effects, like taking the important Parks action. Once used, Canteen bonuses remain unavailable until the next season, so timing matters. Overall, they’re a clever way to give players alternative paths to key actions and resources without relying solely on open trail spaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another way to earn points on the trail is by taking photos. This is most commonly done by visiting a Trail Site or the Trail’s End space with a photo icon, where you can exchange any single resource to take a photo worth one point. The player with the most photos at the end of the game also earns bonus points, giving you a good reason to snap a few along the way. If you land on a space with the Shutterbug badge, you’ll claim the Shutterbug token, which lets you take a second photo each time you use the photo action, as long as you can pay for it. However, the token can be taken by other players, so make the most of it while it’s yours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During your expedition, you’ll have chances to visit the Gear shop and purchase items to help you along the trail. Gear costs between one and three sun resources, depending on the effect. While Gear doesn’t directly earn you points, it offers light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> opportunities like gaining bonus resources at specific Trail Sites, filling your Canteen after certain actions, or refreshing your Campfire more often. That said, I found the Gear shop to be hit or miss, unless it directly benefits your overall gameplan. You’re usually better off saving your resources for visiting parks, since that’s where the real points are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks supports solo play and up to five players, I found it shines best with two or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three players</a>. However, the strategy feels much more cutthroat at two players (a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, this is not). Regardless of player count, when only one player has hikers left on the trail, they must move both hikers to Trail’s End on their next turn. This rule keeps players from being too greedy with trying to hit every space along the way, as they risk being rushed and missing out on more valuable opportunities. In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player game</a>, this is even more noticeable, since one player can jump to the end early and force the other to skip potential turns needed to catch up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you have a few hikes under your belt, you can add optional modules to Parks to increase variety or raise the difficulty. The Camping mode introduces three tents to the trail, allowing you to choose from a pool of powerful bonuses. However, using a tent means you cannot collect resources or use the action at that Trail Site. Volunteer Projects add more challenge by introducing restrictions that players must follow, such as spending extra resources when visiting parks, limiting the number of Wildlife tokens you can hold, or only being allowed to visit parks you’ve already reserved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks includes a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo mode</a> that pits you against Ranger Teddy, an automa made up of two sets of hikers that take actions by flipping cards to determine their movement. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible, which adds plenty of replayability. While Ranger Teddy’s hikers don’t collect resources, purchase Gear, or visit parks directly, they discard those elements when landing on the corresponding spaces, effectively simulating the pressure of competing players. Because their movement is often unpredictable, you’ll need to stay on your toes in order to succeed. You can also add Ranger Teddy to multiplayer games to simulate more players on the trail and add some variety.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Parks (2nd Edition)</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a03b63?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgJqo?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3eGN?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Keymaster Games</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbZV1?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 23, 2025 6:50 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Parks (2nd Edition) is a cozy strategy game that pairs beautiful visuals with deceptively simple worker placement. It builds on everything that made the original great, refining the experience with streamlined rules that are easy to learn but still reward smart play. Its interconnected systems create fresh challenges each time you hit the trail, encouraging careful planning and efficient turns. While visiting parks remains central to the experience, new scoring opportunities provide ample ways to outmaneuver your opponents. Optional modules add variety and difficulty for seasoned players, while the revamped solo mode and Ranger Teddy automa provide plenty of reasons to come back for one more hike.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Licensing revenue was £50 million, up from £31 million. Core profit is £210 million, up from £174.8 million, and licensing profit is £45 million, up from £27 million. That amounts to profit before tax of £255 million, up from £203 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Off the back of those huge profits, and “in recognition of our staff’s contribution to these results,” Games Workshop is giving employees £20 million, up from the £18 million it handed out last year. The money will be paid on an equal basis to each member of staff. Games Workshop is estimated to have around 1,500 staff. If that’s accurate, it means each employee is set for a £13,333 (approx $18,000) bonus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">Games Workshop and Amazon finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Space Marine 3 is also in development.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where does Games Workshop go from here? The company pointed out that licensing revenue in the period is at a record level and it does not expect this to be repeated in 2025/26, although it remains a core focus. Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer generally is bigger than it’s ever been, and based on these results, it’s not slowing down any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop recently held its annual Warhammer Skulls showcase, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-returns-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-and-more-all-the-announcements-and-trailers-from-warhammer-skulls-2025">we’ve got all the announcements and trailers right here</a>.

However, shortly after release, all games plummeted to a "mostly negative" rating on Steam as players flooded the review section to complain about blurry visuals and register their dismay that the games were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xedeid/recommended/2427430/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>now</u></a> "blurry, censored, and revised, [with] added advertisements."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I own the originals and played them to death.

"The graphics aren't upgraded enough to get excited about, I have mixed feelings about stripping out the Russian references - honestly I see the original games as products of their history and although I understand the sensitivities of the developers I'm not sure whats to be gained by retconning them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So it's free so I've nothing to complain about, but it's not a huge step up from the original and to be honest, if you want an enhanced edition you can just mod the thing to your hearts content or play anomaly.

"We really want to make your comeback to the Zone special." It then said it would "continue to work on improving the trilogy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "missing geometry," players believe, refers to the missing Soviet relics found across all three games.
