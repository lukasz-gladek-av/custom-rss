			<p>This year has been a horrible one for people in the games industry, as there has been nonstop layoffs across the board. From big companies to indie developers, it doesn't seem like anyone has been spared from it. It's been announced that Deck Nine, the developers behind recently released title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> has laid off more staff. This isn't even the first time this year for Deck Nine, as they experienced layoffs earlier in the year, too.</p>
<p>A statement was shared on the<a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Deck Nine X page</a>, where a statement was made by Mark Lyons, the CEO of the company. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members. This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion, and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.<br>
To those of you leaving the studio to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can.<br>
To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time."</p>
<p>At the moment, the reason behind the layoffs hasn't been stated, but it is possible that it's due to the fact that Life is Strange: Double Exposure didn't perform to their expectations, as a lot of people were disappointed with the narrative and especially the ending of the game.</p>
<p>The gaming industry has seen more than 14,600 confirmed jobs lost across 175+ companies in 2024. The most recent layoffs that we saw confirmed were layoffs at Ubisoft that happened earlier in the week, where nearly 300 people have been confirmed to be laid off at the company due to studios within Ubisoft being shut down due to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/"> XDefiant officially closing down next year</a>. They are also due to experience more layoffs in February, most likely related to the closure of the studios.</p>
<p>It's not been clarified how many people have been laid off at Deck Nine Games, with their number of staff already being relatively small. In February, they laid off roughly 20% of their staff. Combining that with this new layoff, it's hard to know how many staff members will be left at the company.</p>

<p>In March, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">showed off its first Genie AI model</a>. After training on thousands of hours of 2D run-and-jump video games, the model could generate halfway-passable, interactive impressions of those games based on generic images or text descriptions.</p>
<p>Nine months later, this week's <a href="https://deep%20mind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">reveal of the Genie 2 model</a> expands that idea into the realm of fully 3D worlds, complete with controllable third- or first-person avatars. Google's announcement talks up Genie 2's role as a "foundational world model" that can create a fully interactive internal representation of a virtual environment. That could allow AI agents to train themselves in synthetic but realistic environments, Google says, forming an important stepping stone on the way to artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>But while Genie 2 shows just how much progress Google's Deepmind team has achieved in the last nine months, the limited public information about the model thus far leaves a lot of questions about how close we are to these foundational model worlds being useful for anything but some short but sweet demos.</p>
<h2>How long is your memory?</h2>
<p>Much like the original 2D Genie model, Genie 2 starts from a single image or text description and then generates subsequent frames of video based on both the previous frames and fresh input from the user (such as a movement direction or "jump"). Google says it trained on a "large-scale video dataset" to achieve this, but it doesn't say just how much training data was necessary compared to the 30,000 hours of footage used to train the first Genie.</p>
<p>Short GIF demos on <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">the Google DeepMind promotional page</a> show Genie 2 being used to animate avatars ranging from wooden puppets to intricate robots to a boat on the water. Simple interactions shown in those GIFs demonstrate those avatars busting balloons, climbing ladders, and shooting exploding barrels without any explicit game engine describing those interactions.</p>

      </figure>

<p>Perhaps the biggest advance claimed by Google here is Genie 2's "long horizon memory." This feature allows the model to remember parts of the world as they come out of view and then render them accurately as they come back into the frame based on avatar movement. This kind of persistence has proven to be a persistent problem for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">video generation models like Sora</a>, which OpenAI said in February "do[es] not always yield correct changes in object state" and can develop "incoherencies... in long duration samples."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The "long horizon" part of "long horizon memory" is perhaps a little overzealous here, though, as Genie 2 only "maintains a consistent world for up to a minute," with "the majority of examples shown lasting [10 to 20 seconds]." Those are definitely impressive time horizons in the world of AI video consistency, but it's pretty far from what you'd expect from any other real-time game engine. Imagine entering a town in a <em>Skyrim</em>-style RPG, then coming back five minutes later to find that the game engine had forgotten what that town looks like and generated a completely different town from scratch instead.</p>
<h2>What are we prototyping, exactly?</h2>
<p>Perhaps for this reason, Google suggests Genie 2 as it stands is less useful for creating a complete game experience and more to "rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences" or to turn "concept art and drawings... into fully interactive environments."</p>
<p>The ability to transform static "concept art" into lightly interactive "concept videos" could definitely be useful for visual artists brainstorming ideas for new game worlds. However, these kinds of AI-generated samples might be less useful for prototyping actual game <em>designs </em>that go beyond the visual.</p>


<p>On Bluesky, British game designer Sam Barlow (<em>Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</em>, <em>Her Story</em>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrsambarlow.bsky.social/post/3lclhskbxgk2r">points out</a> how game designers often use a process called <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/white-boxing-your-game">whiteboxing</a> to lay out the structure of a game world as simple white boxes well before the artistic vision is set. The idea, he says, is to "prove out and create a gameplay-first version of the game that we can lock so that art can come in and add expensive visuals to the structure. We build in lo-fi because it allows us to focus on these issues and iterate on them cheaply before we are too far gone to correct."</p>
<p>Generating elaborate visual worlds using a model like Genie 2 before designing that underlying structure feels a bit like putting the cart before the horse. The process almost seems designed to generate generic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip">"asset flip"-style</a> worlds with AI-generated visuals papered over generic interactions and architecture.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As podcaster Ryan Zhao <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insrtcoins.bsky.social/post/3lcl6epzwm22k">put it on Bluesky</a>, "The design process has gone wrong when what you need to prototype is 'what if there was a space.'"</p>

<h2>Gotta go fast</h2>
<p>When Google revealed the first version of Genie earlier this year, it also <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15391v1">released a detailed research paper</a> outlining the specific steps taken behind the scenes to train the model and how that model generated interactive videos. They haven't done the same for a research paper detailing Genie 2's process, leaving us guessing at some important details.</p>
<p>One of the most important of these details is model speed. The first Genie model generated its world at roughly one frame per second, a rate that was orders of magnitude slower than would be tolerably playable in real time. For Genie 2, Google only says that "the samples in this blog post are generated by an undistilled base model, to show what is possible. We can play a distilled version in real-time with a reduction in quality of the outputs."</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, it sounds like the full version of Genie 2 operates at something well below the real-time interactions implied by those flashy GIFs. It's unclear how much "reduction in quality" is necessary to get a diluted version of the model to real-time controls, but given the lack of examples presented by Google, we have to assume that reduction is significant.</p>

<p>Real-time, interactive AI video generation isn't exactly a pipe dream. Earlier this year, AI model maker <a href="https://www.decart.ai/">Decart</a> and hardware maker <a href="https://www.etched.com/">Etched</a> published <a href="https://oasis-model.github.io/">the Oasis model</a>, showing off a human-controllable, AI-generated video clone of <em>Minecraft</em> that runs at a full 20 frames per second. However, that 500 million parameter model was trained on millions of hours of footage of a single, relatively simple game, and focused exclusively on the limited set of actions and environmental designs inherent to that game.</p>
<p>When Oasis launched, its creators fully admitted the model "struggles with domain generalization," showing how "realistic" starting scenes <a href="https://oasis-model.github.io/colloseum.webp">had to be reduced to simplistic <em>Minecraft</em> blocks</a> to achieve good results. And even with those limitations, it's not hard to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/11/03/minecraft-is-finally-haunted-thanks-to-generative-ai/">find footage</a> of Oasis <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWh4u2sXBhU">degenerating into horrifying nightmare fuel</a> after just a few minutes of play.</p>

      What started as a realistic-looking soldier in this Genie 2 demo degenerates into this blobby mess just seconds later.

<p>We can already see similar signs of degeneration in the extremely short GIFs shared by the Genie team, such as an avatar's <a href="https://deepmind.google/api/blob/website/media/long_video_1.mp4">dream-like fuzz</a> during high-speed movement or NPCs that <a href="https://deepmind.google/api/blob/website/media/npc_1.mp4">quickly fade into undifferentiated blobs</a> at a short distance. That's not a great sign for a model whose "long memory horizon" is supposed to be a key feature.</p>

      From this image, Genie 2 could generate a useful training environment for an AI agent and a simple "pick a door" task.

<p>Genie 2 seems to be using individual game frames as the basis for the animations in its model. But it also seems able to infer some basic information about the objects in those frames and craft interactions with those objects in the way a game engine might.</p>
<p>Google's blog post shows how <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/">a SIMA agent</a> inserted into a Genie 2 scene can follow simple instructions like "enter the red door" or "enter the blue door," controlling the avatar via simple keyboard and mouse inputs. That could potentially make Genie 2 environment a great test bed for AI agents in various synthetic worlds.</p>
<p>Google claims rather grandiosely that Genie 2 puts it on "the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards [artificial general intelligence]." Whether or not that ends up being true, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05741">recent research</a> shows that agent learning gained from foundational models can be effectively applied to real-world robotics.</p>
<p>Using this kind of AI model to create worlds for other AI models to learn in might be the ultimate use case for this kind of technology. But when it comes to the dream of an AI model that can create generic 3D worlds that a human player could explore in real time, we might not be as close as it seems.</p>

If you'd been hoping to round out your 2024 with a solid blast of 90s nostalgia, there's some bad news; Argonaut Games' Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster - previously scheduled to release this month - has been delayed into "Q1" next year.
</p>
<p>
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos initially launched for PlayStation 1 some 27 years ago, taking players - in the role of the titular reptile - on a platforming adventure through Gobbo Valley in a bid to free their friends from the evil magician Baron Dante.
</p>
<p>
Argonaut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-is-being-remastered-by-resurrected-argonaut-games">announced it was resurrecting its beloved 1997 3D platformer back in August</a> - news that was doubly surprisingly given that Argonaut itself hadn't existed since it closed amid financial troubles in 2004. However, the studio has itself now risen from the ashes of the past as a "boutique publisher" under the watch of new co-CEOs Gary Sheinwald and Mike Arkin.

<p>
The revived company's Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster was originally due to launch for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via GOG) this month, but Argonaut has now pushed its release back into early 2025 in order to "add the final touches to ensure the game meets the high standards that we aspire to and which you deserve."
</p><p>
"We understand that after 27 years of waiting, this news might be a little disappointing," it continued, "especially with the festive season coming soon. However, our goal has always been to deliver a game with the quality and polish that will truly delight. We appreciate your patience and support as we work to bring Croc back in the best possible way."
</p>
<p>
Argonaut's Croc: Legend of the Gobbos spruce-up promises enhanced high-definition graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and a "nostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience". It'll also include the Crocipedia, a "curated digital museum" incorporating the likes of game design documents, concept art, animation tests, and team member interviews.
</p>
<p>
When Croc: Legend of the Gobbos eventually shows up next year, its digital edition - available on all platforms - will cost $29.99 USD, while a PS5 and Switch physical edition is priced at $39.99. But if you're absolutely wild with nostalgia, a $129.99 Collector's Edition is also available, packing in the remaster, a full-colour manual, a four-disc soundtrack featuring over 100 tunes, a key chain, sticker sheet, poster, premium box, and eight-inch resin Croc statue.

Because Valve may have a <em>lot</em> of SteamOS hardware on the way.</p><div><p>If there’s fire where we currently see smoke, Valve is currently preparing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172293/valve-deckard-vr-headset-rumor-patent-images-leak">wireless VR headset codename Deckard</a>, a pair <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">of trackable wands codename Roy</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">a Steam Controller 2 gamepad codename Ibex</a>, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314279/what-could-valve-possibly-be-cooking-with-amd-chromeos-and-hdmi-cec">codename Fremont living room console</a> too. (That last one <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1864960200924450934">now looks likelier</a> than it did yesterday.) And Valve has also now seemingly revealed plans for partners to create third-party SteamOS hardware too.</p></div><p>It won’t be easy to take on Sony, Microsoft, or Meta. Those companies have a lot to lose, and they’re deeply entrenched. But the Steam Deck has revealed a massive weakness in each of their businesses that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">may take</a> them <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">years to correct</a> — the desire to play a huge library of games anytime, anywhere. </p><p>And while they figure <em>that</em> out, Valve may be building an entire new ecosystem of SteamOS hardware, one that could finally let PC and peripheral makers tap into the huge and growing library of Windows games on all sorts of different hardware without relying on Microsoft or subjecting their customers to the many annoyances of Windows.  </p><p>Today, every major PC company is building <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">one or more Steam Deck rivals</a>. But without Valve’s blessing and support, they’re saddled with a Windows OS that doesn’t start, pause, and resume games quickly and seamlessly enough to feel portable and easy. When building those handhelds, they typically rely on off-the-shelf AMD chips, too, since no other manufacturer’s parts currently compete on Windows gaming plus battery. </p><p>But Valve has long said it will open up SteamOS to other manufacturers, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">recently committing to some direct support for rival handhelds</a> like the Asus ROG Ally — and the other week, Valve quietly updated <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">a document</a> that may reveal its larger overarching strategy. It won’t just leave SteamOS sitting around and hope manufacturers build something — it’ll hold their hand.</p><div><figcaption><em>Valve’s new branding guidelines include “Powered by SteamOS” hardware.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Vale</cite></p></div><p>Valve now has an explicit label for third parties to create “Powered by SteamOS” devices, which it explicitly defines as “hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.” </p><p>It additionally lets companies create “Steam Compatible” hardware that ships with “Valve approved controller inputs,” as well as SteamVR hardware and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22962051/steam-games-remote-play-windows-ios-android-macos-streaming">Steam Link</a> hardware that lets you stream games from one device to another. </p><p>And if the leaks are correct, manufacturers may not have to pick just one or two of those labels. <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1861563064836915429">It sounds like</a> Valve’s Steam Controller 2 may contain the ingredients to be recognized and tracked in a VR environment and that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">Valve’s VR wands</a> will feature enough buttons to double as a gamepad, playing Steam’s massive library of flatscreen games as well. </p><p>Valve may be putting in the work to reduce dependence on AMD’s x86 chips as well. Datamining by Brad Lynch, the Valve watcher whose community has uncovered most if not all of these leaks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24250135/is-valve-cooking-up-an-arm-powered-vr-headset">showed that Valve has been testing many Steam games</a>, including VR games, on Arm chips as well. </p><p>While Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview?ref=uploadvr.com#:~:text=the%20Steam%20Deck%E2%80%99s%20custom%20APU%20in%20a%20standalone%20VR%20headset">once told me</a> that the Steam Deck’s AMD x86 chip might be a good candidate for a possible future standalone VR headset, Arm chips could potentially offer better battery life and lower weight for a portable product than x86 — even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314279/what-could-valve-possibly-be-cooking-with-amd-chromeos-and-hdmi-cec">while Valve investigates more powerful AMD solutions than ever</a> for a possible living room console.</p><p>When Valve asked PC manufacturers to sign onto its Steam Machines initiative over a decade ago, with the idea of building living room PC consoles, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial">it asked for a leap of faith with very little to show and a tiny chance of success</a>. It took years for Valve to even build the oddball living room controller for its Steam Machines, and it didn’t get far in convincing Windows game developers to port their games to Linux. </p><p>But by the time it announced the Steam Deck, Valve had hammered out a Proton software compatibility layer so good that many Windows games now run <em>better</em> on Linux, and created the most customizable yet familiar set of controls ever made.</p><p>If manufacturers could build their own Steam Machines rather than equivalent Windows machines, they could offer better gaming products than they do today. Maybe they’d even want to release a VR headset that isn’t tied to Microsoft or Meta if it doubled as a Steam Deck, portably playing decades of flatscreen games.</p><p>It’s not clear any of this will pan out; Valve is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">an exceedingly small company</a> that tries not to chase too many things at a time. When I speak to PC industry executives about why they pick Windows over SteamOS, some say they’re concerned about whether Valve would truly be able to support them. </p><div><p>But it’s just as intriguing an idea <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652756/valve-big-picture-mode-steam-os-linux-game-console">as it was 12 years ago</a> when Gabe Newell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">explained the initial vision to us</a>, and this time, there’s a far better chance it’ll work.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It looks like Square Enix are winding down support for Foamstars, their cartoony foam brawler.&nbsp; Someone at Square seems to have an ironic sense of humour as the final season is called “Party Goes On!”.</p>
<p>“In this concluding update, expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customize shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future,” say Square Enix.</p>


<p>“All online services will remain available after the “PARTY GOES ON!” season ends. In addition, we plan to hold the FOAMSTARS CUP, a series of in-game events named after each character.<br>
Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy FOAMSTARS, previous Season Passes will be made available again. Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Foamstars - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jla2yb3VbGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PS5 exclusive game went free to play in October this year but that doesn’t seem to have helped boost the popularity of the game.</p>

<p>Launched in February as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly game and PS4 and PS5 exclusive, before transitioning to being a moderately priced premium game in March. However, it seems that this hasn’t given the game a large enough community, pushing Square Enix to shift business models. An additional benefit of this change is that, as a free-to-play game, Foamstars will no longer require a PS Plus subscription in order to play online.</p>
<p>Foamstars was quickly pegged as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon</a> copycat by gamers, but introduced some quirky ideas alongside, such as being able to build up the foam into 3D structures, instead of just blanketing the level in your team’s colour.</p>
<p>Looking back at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/12/foamstars-review-ps4-ps5-ps-plus/">Foamstars review</a>, Jim said, “Foamstars is a vibrantly inventive take on the hero shooter and Splatoon, though the bubble will quickly burst for those who can’t gel with its floaty, fluid-based gunplay.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-video-game-history-foundation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unless there’s imminently mineable gold in the hills of a remaster or re-release, the video game industry rarely displays interest in its own history. Last year, the Video Game History Foundation <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a study</a> showing that 87 percent of classic video games released in the US verge on inaccessible. That makes the archival work done by the VGHF all the more important, but the road to long-term preservation is full of potholes. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk to VGHF founder and director Frank Cifaldi about what those look like and <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can help</a>.</p><p>In an uncommon twist, Frank joins us near the end of the episode, because he had multiple other podcasts to be on the day we recorded (he’s very important). We discuss the unique needs of a video game archive – for example, remote access to games, something the US Copyright Office recently <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused to grant</a> after a three-year effort on the part of the VGHF and the Software Preservation Network – and what the Foundation has been able to accomplish this year despite a government and industry that often fail to recognize the importance of its work.&nbsp;</p><p>Also on this episode: We (minus Frank) talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s decision to pull the plug on <em>XDefiant</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-future-chatgpt-pc-gamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI’s increasingly money-hungry forays</a> into <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-chatgpt-pro-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscriptions</a> (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/ads-might-be-coming-to-chatgpt-despite-sam-altman-not-being-a-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe ads</a>), and our various hyperfixations in <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Candy Cabs</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>. Oh, and speaking of hyperfixations, Chris says that New Year's resolutions are just an amateur hour version of a real project, so take that, me and everybody else.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can help preserve video game history via a format accessible to and beloved by all: blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> As we reach the end of the year and people are reflecting on what they’ve done – and especially going into <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your funding drive</a> – what has the Video Game History Foundation accomplished this year? What have been your focuses, and what have you managed to achieve?</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> This year has been a lot of building for the future internally, so not very interesting at the outset things. But the actual labor on this <a href="https://gamehistory.org/introducing-the-vghf-digital-library/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital library</a>, the actual building of the tools that do correct character recognition for magazines [has been a focus]. That one’s OCRAP, right Phil? What’s that stand for?</p><p><strong>VGHF library director Phil Salvador [off screen]:</strong> Optical Character Recognition For Archival Purposes.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s so good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> It talks to another tool called BUBSY. Something you overhear pretty often here are phrases like “Should we give BUBSY admin access?” and it’s an actual, real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Building those tools out for our library launch has been a lot of our focus. But beyond that, I think the biggest public-facing thing is that we testified in front of the Copyright Office to try to lift copyright restrictions for libraries and archives to provide remote access to video games, which is something that is not legal to do in any scenario unless you have explicit copyright permission from the copyright holder. That didn’t end up going through. I don’t know if I want to rant publicly about my real thoughts about what went down there, but that’s kind of building off some other work we’ve done to raise awareness of preservation issues.</p><p>A lot of people saw a study we put out last year which was able to demonstrate that nine out of ten classic games are out of print. You can’t buy them. That’s something that I think any one of us here kind of inherently knew, but that the industry wasn’t acknowledging. The last time we tried to get a copyright exemption, [rightsholder groups] were able to successfully argue to the Copyright Office that the industry does a great job of keeping its history in print. So that’s why we did this study to be like “No, you don’t.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What did [the Entertainment Software Association and others associated with rightsholders] <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/can-an-online-library-of-classic-video-games-ever-be-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argue this time</a>? Now that the study is out there, how did they once again say “No, everything is fine”?</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>The argument basically comes down to “We believe there will be market harm if people can play video games remotely through a library.” That people will stop buying video games because they can play some games for free.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s a pretty insane argument, but OK.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The MS-DOS version of <em>Muppet Treasure Island</em> must be protected.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Otherwise I won’t buy the 18th <em>Skyrim </em>re-release.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> Right, if they can play <em>Muppet Treasure Island</em>, they’re not gonna buy <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Simple as that!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I was wondering about this in relation to other recent developments: I’m sure you saw that GOG is having to delist the <em>Warcraft </em>games because Blizzard put out their own remasters, but GOG said they’re still going to continue to update them to run on modern hardware [as part of <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/the-gog-preservation-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Preservation Program</a>]. GOG is a store. Their number one goal is not to preserve history; it’s to make money. But do you think efforts like that still matter? Are they still important in the grand scheme of things?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>I’ve been saying for a long time that there are many forms of preservation, and some of them can be commercial. I think there’s a cultural preservation element to re-releasing games, for example. That is a form of cultural preservation: keeping franchises in the public eye.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think you meant to be reductive, but GOG has a commercial interest, of course, but it’s coming from a place of caring.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh yeah, they obviously care a lot.</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>That said, this is the job of an archive. I would never trust a commercial entity for permanent preservation – or at least an attempt at permanent preservation. I’m really glad they’re doing it. It is a temporary solution for a real problem. I don’t believe that GOG lasts forever, whereas I think a well-funded archive might. And I’m not even necessarily saying ours; we’re not that well-funded yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But the point is, that is the job of a library and an archivist historically. Kind of going back to even the [ESA] thing – how the availability of old stuff for free would hurt the current market – I think we live in a world where if a library was a new idea, everyone would laugh it off.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh, definitely. They’d be like “That’s socialism!”</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> Right, exactly. So it doesn’t surprise me that it’s a tremendous uphill battle to modernize the concept of a library. It makes a lot of sense to me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nadia-removed-from-delta-force-streamer-event-following-%E2%80%98cheater%E2%80%99-investigation.1054437/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nadia Amine, a streamer with a fairly bad reputation, was booted from a Delta Force ‘streamer showdown’ following an investigation into some allegations made against her. </p>



<p>On social media, Team Jade announced that Nadia would be one of many streamers invited to take part in a special event. When users started mentioning her ‘history’ with cheats – most notably in Call of Duty: Warzone – Team Jade said it would ‘investigate further’…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-booted">Booted</h2>



<p>Team Jade ultimately removed Nadia from the Delta Force streamer event. The team scrubbed her from the line-up of content creators without so much as a single word on social media. This came after Team Jade posted a reply to the allegations of past cheating:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to our community for bringing this matter to our attnetion – we are now investigating further.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1865148372459647135/photo/2">Jake Lucky on Twitter</a> for the receipts</em></p>



<p>Team Jade has since deleted that post – but nothing can truly disappear from the internet, right?</p>



<p>By way of a response, Nadia launched into a rant against Team Jade, and she too came with her own receipts on the post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These guys are so unprofessional. They made a tweet about investigating me, their talent, becuase people believe everything they see and spread lies about me. They deleted their tweet, I asked for a public apology, they told me to wait and are checking with the publisher.</p>



<p>I told them I’m going to go public with me leaving, and then they told me again to wait so they can ‘coordinate with their team’. But then, they go public with me not being a talent anymore first, which then makes me look guilty.</p>



<p>After they are the ones who told me to hold off on going public. What kind of f***ing business is this?!!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nadia has admittedly flip-flopped on the cheating bit for the longest time. She rose to notoriety on Call of Duty: Warzone while riding that wave, and even went as far as to make tongue-in-cheek references to being a cheater on social media and streams.</p>



<p>Ultimately, nothing has been definitively proven, even if sleuth gamers have taken to TikTok and other video-sharing platforms to reveal frame-by-frame playbacks of Nadia’s clips.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/akg-perception-p220-p420-mod-neumann-u87-clone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As keen readers of the site may know, I cannot abide using a <a href="https://aftermath.site/dont-buy-a-yeti-mic-please-logitech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad microphone</a> when there are so many good mics that are plentiful. You can get a great sound out of something that costs less than $100 bucks, but when you dig deeper than that into the world of DIY, the value proposition gets more interesting. There’s a rich, gorgeous world out there of hand crafting microphones, but that is a daunting topic for another blog. Instead, I wanna tell you about a simple, 10 minute modification that takes a relatively inexpensive microphone and brings it shockingly close to one of the greatest microphones of all time: the Neumann U 87.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG Perception 5 Minute u87 Clone Mod vs u87ai Comparison Will Surprise You" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgVcD-3OVes?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A direct comparison between the modded AKG Perception vs. a real Neumann U 87 ai.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The mod in question comes from the depths of the GroupDIY forums – a go-to destination for DIY microphone information. Here you can unlock all sorts of information about who makes the best capsules, replica bodies from alibaba, and full replicas of older PCBS. This particular mod was originally pioneered by well-known tinkerer and poster kingkorg, who discovered in 2017 that if you take AKG Perception P220 (and to an extent, many other mics in the same line) and swap or add a single capacitor, you get very close to the legendary U 87.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG Perception 420 / 220 Mod" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmNyNM4rA_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A video walkthrough of how to modify the Perception. Note that the mod for the Perception 200/220 is slightly different than the Perception 400/420. </figcaption></figure></div><p>If you don’t know the Neumann U 87, it’s one of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_U_87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most famous vocal microphones ever made</a>. It was introduced in 1967, going through various iterations. The current model, the U 87 Ai, goes for about $3,595, slightly less used. There are countless clones of it – tinkerers love to try to make them from scratch. The AKG Perception, on the other hand, costs about $140 new and far less used. The reason this mod works is that much of the AKG Perception line is a close replica of the U 87. The problem is that the microphone capsule, while quite good on its own, is slightly brighter than the one being cloned. This one capacitor mod fixes that. While it does not make the mic identical to the Neumann (there is more to mic design than a circuit, for example the body and <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1099560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the headbasket</a>) it gets it very close for $140 plus one mouser or digikey order. In a direct shootout, it’s kinda shocking.</p><figure><figcaption>Kingkorg’s measurements of the P220 before and after modding. For the money, that's very close.

Basically you open up the mic, remove the stock 220pf stock capacitor, and swap in a 680pf capacitor (or 870pF for a sound closer to the u67). It can be done with either a cheap film capacitor, or something pricier like Wima FKP or MKP. Others had luck with 0805 NP0(C0G) surface mount capacitors. <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1120655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But you don’t need a fancy capacitor for it; any ceramic cap will do.</a></p><p>If you are a bit wary of desoldering, which is unquestionably the most annoying part of working on electronics, people in the thread report that you can simply <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1045611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add an additional 470pF capacitor in parallel</a> with the one already there, no desoldering required. This is what I actually ended up doing.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG P420  - Modified!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFwtcQ23OIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Another satisfied customer.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Do I need a Neumann clone? Not particularly. I mainly use dynamic mics and have more than enough of those. But because the AKG Perception series is one of the best selling mic lines out there, and tons of them have entered circulation, I was able to score a beat up Perception 200 for $40 dollars on eBay. Secondary markets are lousy with these things, and it is a cheap way to experiment and pass the savings on to you, the Aftermath reader. What’s more, my good friends at the <a href="https://www.skulltenders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skulltenders podcast</a> needed a condenser mic, and were able to snag one. It worked so well that my friend who did the mod for them <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emkultra64.bsky.social/post/3lcntvndwbk2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got one herself.</a></p><figure><figcaption>This is all&nbsp;I had to do to smooth this bad boy out. The P400/P420 has a slightly different layout but it's roughly the same idea.</figcaption></figure><p>Doing the mod was comically easy, at least for me. You open up the body of the mic by using a pair of pliers to unscrew the ring securing the shell. Once you open it up, everything is already there for you; no need to remove the boards, the capsule or even the headbasket. It was as simple as soldering a cheap 470 pF capacitor over the existing capacitor. It should be noted that the PCBs for the P200/P220 are slightly different from the P400/P420 and so the capacitor you need to solder over is in two different places depending on your model. Also, <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/#post-857101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all mics in the Perception series appear to be compatible</a> (the Perception 120 is a different mic altogether, and the Perception 820 is a tube mic).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG Perception Series Comparison Shopping Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkWP_ez319g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A comparison of the different mics from the AKG Perception line. Most of the mics have minor differences, although the AKG 120 and 820 are far different.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a side-by-side comparison, the results blew me away. The hash tinniness of the mic that held back an otherwise great capsule is no longer present, instead exposing a rich low end. It turned an <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/akg-perception-200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already well-liked microphone</a> into something I would be proud to give to any vocalist. Is it a Neumann? I don’t think so, and also I don’t have one for testing because I don’t have $3,595 burning a hole in my pocket. But it’s certainly worth the $40 dollars plus maybe $10 dollar bulk capacitor order, and definitely a good value given that one of the mics is 90 times more expensive than the other.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p>https://twitter.com/Papapishu/status/1865111084652261788</p><figcaption>My comparison between the two mics. You can also hear <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3lcnuuv3iqk2m">the difference on Bluesky.</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Others in the thread agree. Five years after posting the thread on GroupDIY the creator of the mod, kingkorg, noted that, despite having access to genuine Neumanns, the friends he gave the modded Perception to <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1109409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still return to it year after year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was originally scheduled to launch at 2 PM EST / 11 AM PST, but the developer, Grinding Gear Games, decided to do some last-minute database upgrades, as there were a ton more players eagerly queued up to play the game, and they didn't expect as many as there were. So, they did the database upgrades to try and be able to handle the influx of players. However, the upgrades didn't go as planned, with the team working on the database saying that it would only take a "half-hour" to get access to Path of Exile 2. However, that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>As they were trying to upgrade the database, they found another issue within the game. It started with a crash that "would have affected a majority of users," which was promptly fixed, with the developers saying that the game was ready to be deployed and that the Early Access release was "relatively imminent." However, it was not to be, as the team ran into yet another issue with configuration, and said that they needed to restart the realm. All of this is being updated on<a href="https://x.com/pathofexile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> their social media</a>, where they are giving those who are interested a play-by-play on how they are running into issues and what they are doing to resolve them.</p>
<p>While they did manage to fix that issue, they said that the ran into the same symptom again, but with a different problem, where multiple characters had the same character ID. They have followed up by saying:</p>
<p>"We've run into the same symptom again with a different problem. We are working on fixing it again but regrettably every time this happens we have to restart and wipe the databases to prevent them getting into bad or corrupted states. We'll have a fix out as soon as we can!"</p>
<p>They have assured the audience that they will be kept updated during this time, as they have a rocky Early Access launch ahead of them. However, it's already more popular than World of Warcraft and New World on Twitch and is <a href="https://x.com/nugiyen/status/1865125378781569460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently more popular than Diablo IV</a> in terms of live viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to the live servers of the game being down, the official Path of Exile 2 website is also down, with the website just taking you to a blank page that says "temporarily unavailable..."</p>
<p>We will continue to update you as there are changes and fixes made by the developers who are hard at work.</p>

			<p>Xbox Game Pass already had a ton of brilliant games to get stuck into, and it's now been announced by Crytek that Hunt: Showdown 1896 will also be joining <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-launches-on-game-pass-tomorrow/">the roster of games</a> available to play. For those who are subscribers, you'll be able to play Hunt: Showdown 1896 from 12 December 2024. This is only a couple of days away. On the same day the game is coming to Xbox Game Pass, Post Malone's collaboration with the game will be arriving, called Post Malone's Murder Circus. You can watch a trailer for his event below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Post Malone's Murder Circus Trailer | #HuntPartner | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ooh5BxMHwhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those interested in taking part in Post Malone's event in-game, it will be running from December 12 through February 10, 2025. The event will transport you to a different place in time where you will get to experience a supernatural carnival that makes its mark on the bayou, gulch, and more. At the circus, you'll find Post Malone, the Deposed King and former Ringmaster, who leads you through the horrifying show. The circus is corrupted by the cursed HelioStone, which is a supernatural artifact, bringing horrifying threats to the game in areas like the bayou and the Mammon's Gulch.</p>
<p>This event will introduce new horrifying creatures, such as the Ursa Mortis, which is a strong, two-headed bear. Along with them, you'll see plenty of Circus Grunts floating about, especially while you're inside the Circus compound. To be able to combat these new enemies, you'll be given weapons like the Shredder, which fires sawblades, and Chu Ko Nu, a repeating crossbow.</p>
<p>That's not the only thing added to be able to survive the circus, as you'll also be given the chance to use new weapon variants, such as the 1865 Carbine Aperture, Krag Silencer, Maynard Sniper Silencer, and Sparks Pistol Silencer. This update is a pretty big one, as there is new equipment to use, such as the Recovery Shot consumable and Subsonic Ammo type.</p>
<p>New content isn't the only thing coming to Hunt: Showdown 1896 with this update, as they have also added enhanced silencer mechanics, tweaks to animations, bug fixes and quality-of-life changes to make the game enjoyable for new and returning players of the game.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Post Malone's update, you can check out the <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/post-malone-s-murder-circus-coming-to-hunt-showdown-1896-on-dec-12th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, which has all of the details for the horrifying circus event, as well as the gory details about what you can expect to contend with while you're there.</p>
<p>This update will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>s share something in common. Both (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a>’s Squall and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.</p>
<p>The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:</p>

<p>Gwent itself has seen a few iterations over the years. There was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">standalone online game</a> that I had some fun with for a bit, even if it shattered CDProjekt’s image as the ‘No Microtransactions, Free DLC and a Back Massage’ studio by having the most nefarious loot box animation I’d ever encountered. Then there was the rather good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>, which wove Gwent into a single-player story. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales-review">quite liked it</a>.</p>
<p>You can read the full press release <a href="https://www.hachetteboardgames.co.uk/gwent-announcement">here</a>, if you’d like. This one is supposed to be out Q3 of next year. In other Witchly news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> has entered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">"the most intensive phase of development</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
