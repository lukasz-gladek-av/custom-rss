<p data-characters="204" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Clorinde is a 5-star Electro DPS character in <em>Genshin Impact</em> with unique Bond of Life mechanics. Once you’ve learned <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/?p=528421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to play Clorinde</a>, here are the best weapons and artifacts to maximize her damage.</p> <h2 id="h-clorinde-s-best-weapons-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Clorinde’s best weapons in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-absolution" data-injectable="false">Absolution</h3> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Absolution is Clorinde’s best weapon. As her signature 5-star Sword, its passive is tailor-made for her Bond of Life mechanics, and Clorinde should have no trouble keeping uptime on its buff. Still, the difference in damage between Absolution and the other 5-stars below is not wide enough to justify gambling on the weapon banner.</p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-light-of-foliar-incision-haran-geppaku-futsu" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision / Haran Geppaku Futsu</h3> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision and Haran Heppaku Futsu are good 5-star options if you don’t have Absolution. Their damage comes fairly close to her signature, since their passives are generally useful for Clorinde.</p> <h3 id="h-primordial-jade-cutter-uraku-misugiri" data-injectable="false">Primordial Jade Cutter / Uraku Misugiri</h3> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">PJC and Uraku Misugiri don’t perform quite as well as the options above, but they’re still quite strong on Clorinde. Other 5-star Swords like Splendor of Tranquil Waters or Mistsplitter Reforged will also work fine if you happen to have them.</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-black-sword-finale-of-the-deep" data-injectable="false">The Black Sword / Finale of the Deep</h3> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Black Sword and Finale of the Deep are the 4-star options for Clorinde. With Refinements, Black Sword can be competitive with the 5-stars above. Finale of the Deep is the Fontaine craftable weapon, and I recommend Refining it if possible.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-sets-for-clorinde-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Artifact sets for Clorinde in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-4pc-fragment-of-harmonic-whimsy" data-injectable="false">4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Since Clorinde has Bond of Life built into her kit, she synergizes well with 4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy. If you’re farming from scratch, though, you may want to consider the sets below. They’re almost as good in the right circumstances, and they may be more efficient to farm.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Genshin Impact on Twitter</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-4pc-thundering-fury" data-injectable="false">4pc Thundering Fury</h3> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">4pc Thundering Fury can reduce Clorinde’s Skill cooldown, possibly allowing for shorter or more flexible rotations. Whether this is worth it really depends on your team. At best, Thundering Fury performs similarly to Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy. At worst, if you don’t use the reduced Skill cooldown, it’s roughly on par with Gladiator’s Finale.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4pc-gladiator-s-finale" data-injectable="false">4pc Gladiator’s Finale</h3> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">If neither of the above sets appeal to you, 4pc Gladiator’s Finale is a good alternative. While its damage potential is not as high, it’s very consistent, and you don’t need to worry about optimizing Clorinde’s team to make good use of her build.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-stats-to-prioritize-for-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Artifact stats to prioritize for Clorinde</h2> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sands</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Goblet</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Circlet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">ATK<br>Elemental Mastery</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG</td><td data-align="center">CRIT Rate/DMG</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">Clorinde does not rely on her Burst every rotation, so don’t worry about her Energy Recharge. Focus on offensive stats instead, like CRIT DMG, CRIT Rate, ATK, and Elemental Mastery.</p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Pick a CRIT circlet that brings your CRIT Rate:CRIT DMG ratio closer to 1:2. This will primarily be determined by your weapon; if using a CRIT Rate weapon, try to use a CRIT DMG circlet and vice versa.</p>

<p data-characters="401" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Some players are realizing,&nbsp;as they delve into&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;campaign in&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>,&nbsp;that&nbsp;they&nbsp;don’t have&nbsp;access to the new Prismatic Subclass when they should.&nbsp;As it turns out, this is a bug Bungie has already acknowledged, and a fix is readily available. That said, the workaround solution does require a little extra effort from affected players.</p> <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;expansion launches, as with many MMO expansion launches, are frequently filled with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-server-not-available-issue/" rel="noreferrer noopener">long waits due to player influx</a>&nbsp;and error codes. While Bungie tries to make errors a bit lighthearted by naming them&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-plum-error/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plum</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-the-honeydew-error-in-destiny-2/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honeydew</a>, these sometimes time-consuming network or population issues can be annoying.&nbsp;That said,&nbsp;&nbsp;once players&nbsp;actually&nbsp;get into the game, frustrations typically subside.&nbsp;That’s not the case with this Prismatic bug, as it prevents players from acquiring the Subclass, which&nbsp;is&nbsp;needed&nbsp;throughout the campaign.</p>

While this may not be the news affected players want to hear, the bright side is that there is a solution, and all it requires is a little more time.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Of course, the best option is to&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;circumvent the issue altogether.&nbsp;For the best results, players shouldn’t try joining other players while the mission is in progress or start&nbsp;it&nbsp;with players who already have the new Subclass.&nbsp;If players&nbsp;aren’t sure&nbsp;if their run is affected, they’ll know for sure if there isn’t a large Prismatic interactable just before approaching the Rally flag for the final encounter.</p>

  <p id="H5Cd7I"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24167362/star-wars-acolyte-high-republic-future"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, Disney Plus’ latest contribution to the Star Wars universe, is a murder mystery.

But now that we’re two episodes into the season, an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23935413">entirely different puzzle</a> has become the brightest spot in the show to me.</p>
<p id="j91gYw">It’s an irresistibly Star Wars-y question, but more importantly, it’s a perfect frame for exactly the kind of action cred that was briefly, thrillingly, core to the Star Wars franchise. </p>

<p id="m9OsDr">How do you kill a Jedi without using a weapon? </p>
<p id="p8fEVU">This is the challenge posed to Mae, our erstwhile apprentice, by her master, who looks like a Sith and quacks like a Sith, but as yet has not had much time to espouse his alliances or philosophy. As the final lesson in her training, Mae has to kill at least one Jedi without using a weapon, in order to kill “the dream.” What dream? The dream that all Jedi live in, apparently, “a dream they believe everyone shares.” </p>
<p id="Ija6bt">According to Mae’s master, “An acolyte kills without a weapon; an acolyte kills the dream.” </p>
<h2 id="Vy6CJ9"><strong>What does that mean? </strong></h2>
<p id="V71VNA">It means everybody’s kung fu fighting, baby. </p>
<p id="1YsZWk"><em>The Acolyte</em>’s unarmed, hand-to-hand combat stuck out from the moment its trailers dropped. There’s very little anywhere in live-action Star Wars like it — the gravitational coolness of lightsabers is too much to escape. Jedi and Sith fight with swords; everybody knows this. Smugglers and soldiers use blasters. Wookiees have crossbows that shoot lasers. Even Donnie Yen’s enigmatic Force adherent-but-definitely-not-Jedi Chirrut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8trWiJLgs">fights with a stick</a>. Blame <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/12/21/22063580/star-wars-toys-action-figures-collectors-mandalorian-replicas">the market for action figures</a> with accessories, I suppose. </p>
<p id="UP2jiO">For all that Star Wars is rooted in samurai film, it has precious few callbacks to the immortal trope of a fighter who refuses to draw his blade. But in <em>The Acolyte</em>, that’s how every Mae-versus-Jedi fight begins, because a Jedi won’t draw on an unarmed foe. In these first two episodes, Mae’s clashes with Carrie-Anne Moss’ Master Indara and Lee Jung-jae’s Master Sol are hyper-quick, riveting battles for dominance, where we get to see Mae’s desperation contrasted with an unbreakable Jedi cool. We get those wild superhero moments when Mae reaches to steal a lightsaber <em>mid-combat</em> and is met with an impossibly quick twist of a supernaturally endowed body. It’s the blow-for-blow, arm’s length, move-and-counter suspense of a great hand-to-hand martial arts sequence.  </p>
<p id="leCEIJ">Mae’s quest to kill a Jedi without a weapon returns Star Wars to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24141905/star-wars-phantom-menace-lightsaber-duel-fates-fight-choreography">the realm of Fight Scene Cinema</a> that the franchise developed during production on the prequel films, but that has rarely, if ever, been equaled in live action since. But it also gives <em>The Acolyte</em> its best mystery. Not a whodunit, but a How Do You Do It?</p>
<p id="Od3No9">Sol and his allies are solving a murder mystery, sure — we’ve seen that a million times — but Mae is out here beating her head against a koan handed to her by a Murder Buddhist, and I’m just waiting for the moment when she realizes that <em>maybe</em> the answer isn’t literal. </p>

  <p id="ZxzT6r"><em>The Acolyte</em> is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20959862/star-wars-watch-order-disney-plus-movies-shows-chronological-skywalker-saga">latest Star Wars series</a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23672528/star-wars-movies-tv-schedule-calendar-upcoming">launch on Disney Plus</a>. Unlike previous series, such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23896100/star-wars-ahsoka-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Ahsoka</em></a><em> </em>(after <em>Return of the Jedi</em>) and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23475516/andor-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Andor</em></a><em> </em>(before <em>A New Hope</em>), it takes place in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673950/star-wars-timeline-dawn-of-jedi-new-order">a unique and largely unexplored era</a> of the Star Wars galaxy (in live action, at least). Created by Leslye Headland, a self-professed major Star Wars fan, and starring Lee Jung-jae, Amandla Stenberg, and Carrie-Anne Moss, <em>The Acolyte</em> is intended to be as new-viewer-friendly as possible. </p>
<p id="pmlGJH">That said, there are a few questions viewers may have as they head into the two-part series premiere, and we’ve got the answers!</p>
<h2 id="csTmFG"><strong>What is the High Republic? </strong></h2>
<p id="aKmVZz">Launched in January 2021, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24167362/star-wars-acolyte-high-republic-future">the High Republic began as a sub-franchise</a> publishing initiative from Lucasfilm, told across a variety of short stories, novels, and comic books. Named for the era of in-universe galactic history that marks a relative cultural and political high-water mark for the Republic in general and the Jedi specifically, stories set in the High Republic Era take place anywhere between 500 and 100 years before the events of the nine films that comprise the cinematic Skywalker Saga. For anyone familiar with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23845775/star-wars-old-republic-hella-tight">the Old Republic Era</a> thanks to the series of wildly popular video games set in that era, the High Republic Era falls squarely between that time and the time of the “main” movies.</p>
<p id="t4GfU0">The stories typically chronicle the conflict between the Jedi and the Nihil, a group of ruthless space pirates who use their arcane knowledge of hyperspace travel to carry out devastating attacks on the Republic. But one of the things that distinguishes the High Republic from similar era-specific publishing efforts is its wide scope. With stories told in everything from books for young readers to YA novels to traditional adult novels, from comic books to audio dramas, there are different tones and flavors for a wide variety of tastes. The Nihil are far from the only threat facing the galaxy, which also includes the Dregnir — a species of carnivorous sentient plants — as well as cults consisting of other non-Jedi Force users. The Jedi dealing with the threat of the Nihil during an era of prosperity forms the narrative backbone of the sub-franchise, but even in the short existence of the High Republic as a storytelling initiative, the sheer volume and breadth of stories released creates a lot of nooks and crannies to explore. </p>

<p id="J6hsHa"><em>The Acolyte</em> represents the first on-screen foray into the High Republic Era. It is also marking the latest point yet in the High Republic Era — that is, the point in time closest to the previously established events of the movies. Specifically, <em>The Acolyte</em> takes place about 100 years before the rise of the Empire, putting it toward the very tail end of the High Republic Era.</p>

<p id="XlJdBK">That point in the timeline is very much intentional. According to showrunner <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/leslye-headland-interview">Leslye Headland</a>, “If Star Wars is about the underdog versus the institution, [in <em>The Acolyte</em>] the Jedi are the institution. I was so interested in a storyline where the Jedi were at the height of their power — and I don’t mean <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, because at that point, there’s a Sith Lord in the Senate that they’re not picking up on.” Headland also expresses a desire to explore “what went wrong” that led the Jedi Order from the highs of the High Republic to the stagnation and ignorance displayed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23352914/best-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-ranked">during the prequel trilogy</a>, in which the Jedi are hoodwinked into aiding their own downfall by a threat hiding right under their collective noses. </p>
<p id="6abElN">Setting <em>The Acolyte</em> at the tail end of the Jedi heyday is thus critical to that examination. It allows Headland and her team the closest possible chronological point to the prequels, to draw the most direct line possible from the Jedi at their zenith to the Jedi at their nadir. </p>
<p id="F1Fehg">It’s also worth noting, to that end, that the Jedi of the High Republic are, in their ways, quite a bit different from the Jedi of the prequel trilogy. Some of the differences are simply aesthetic; in addition to the “typical” look of simple robes not unlike those worn by moisture farmers and desert hermits, the High Republic Jedi also don more resplendent dress robes of shimmering white and gold. Their lightsabers are more ornate (and, occasionally, more <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightwhip">whip-like</a>), with pronounced physical hilts, and they are worn in leather holsters rather than simply dangling from belts. Mission attire for High Republic Jedi includes leather gauntlets and armor. </p>
<p id="yJCFDI">But the differences go deeper than that. While the Jedi of the High Republic still teach about the dangers of attachment, they are less like the celibate monks of the prequel era. Deep friendships exist among the Jedi, and even, in at least one instance, physical intimacy (which is still frowned upon, but no one was drummed out of the Jedi Order over it). The High Republic Jedi also seem to have a deeper understanding of the Force, with certain Jedi dedicating themselves to the exploration of specific aspects of or abilities with the Force, such as battle meditation or the ability to strengthen the Force bonds among a group of Jedi. This can be seen in <em>The Acolyte</em> via Carrie-Anne Moss’ Indara, a Jedi who is proficient in something not unlike Force-aided kung fu.  </p>
<p id="A538NW">All of this serves to underscore the difference between the High Republic Jedi and the more familiar Jedi of the Skywalker Saga. Which, in turn, underscores that question Headland is eager to explore, of what caused those differences to emerge in the first place. </p>
<h2 id="BeEKDe"><strong>What about the Sith? Where are they during the High Republic?</strong></h2>

<p id="FFzIbW">That answer is a bit more… complicated. In <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, Jedi council member Ki-Adi-Mundi (the conehead Jedi) tells Qui-Gon Jinn that the Sith have been extinct “for a millennium.” That would mean there’s no way the Sith could factor into <em>The Acolyte</em>, given it takes place a mere 100 years before Ki-Adi-Mundi made his declaration, well within that millennium. But, of course, Ki-Adi-Mundi is <em>wrong</em>. He’s wrong even before he speaks the words; the audience has already seen Qui-Gon battle Darth Maul on the sands of Tatooine, and the audience already knows Darth Maul is a Sith, even if the Jedi don’t. And, of course, the Sith’s whole deal is the “Rule of Two,” in which a series of masters and apprentices keep the whole Sith show running, specifically from the shadows. </p>
<p id="CQH6Ry">So the door is certainly open for the Sith to appear in <em>The Acolyte </em>(as they seem to in the first two episodes), albeit in a subtle way (that would still lead Ki-Adi-Mundi to make his incorrect declaration and not get laughed out of the council chambers). Headland has likened the Sith in this era to that of a <em>Velociraptor</em> for the Jedi: “Like it’s a thing I’ve heard of, but it’s not a thing that you would ever consider you’d be interacting with.” Whether they are the central antagonists, and, if so, how they manage to maintain their status as extinct beings of myth and legend remains to be seen. </p>

</p>
<p id="0hwWw5">Honestly, not really. Everyone involved has been very insistent that <em>The Acolyte</em> is not a series that requires homework. It is designed for anyone with just a passing familiarity with Star Wars to pick up and enjoy. </p>
<p id="EJLW5N">One thing worth noting is the presence of Vernestra Rwoh, the only named member of the cast thus far to previously appear in the High Republic. A teen prodigy Jedi, Vernestra made several appearances throughout the publishing line. But like <em>The Acolyte</em>’s setting in the High Republic timeline, her appearance in the series comes later in her own personal timeline, when she is over 100 years old. As a result, while the name will be familiar to High Republic readers, even they will have much to learn about her alongside newcomers.</p>
<p id="3Yx749">Also, anyone who has seen <em>Return of the Jedi </em>knows that Yoda is over 900 years old when he dies, which means he’s very much active during the High Republic Era. No word yet, however, whether he’ll appear in <em>The Acolyte</em>.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171675/zotac-zone-specs-handheld-gaming-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">It’s handheld season</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">Asus ROG Ally X</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex">MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> aren’t the only second-gen Windows gaming handhelds in town — GPU manufacturer Zotac has officially revealed its Zone at Computex, and it does a few things differently than the competition. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167109/zotac-zone-gaming-handheld-oled-display">Zotac already teased</a> that the Zone would have an OLED screen, something that only the Steam Deck OLED has managed in PC handhelds before — as well as two-stage adjustable triggers like an Xbox Elite gamepad and drift resistant Hall effect joysticks. But did you know it’ll also have symmetrical PlayStation-esque joysticks, programmable dials around each one, twin Steam Deck-like trackpads, a small built-in kickstand, a Windows Hello camera instead of a fingerprint reader, and both top and bottom USB4 ports?</p><div><p>Thanks to journalists who descended on Taipei this week, we do — some of whom took <a href="https://x.com/SireGoupil/status/1797882313294160350">good photos</a>, including <a href="https://x.com/OKestGamer/status/1797881423556464777/photo/4">the entire spec sheet</a>. <em>PCWorld</em> even filmed <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6BT-7VxBhBw">a 20-minute long video tour</a>:</p></div><p>The handheld’s powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U chip, and you shouldn’t necessarily expect a lot from it — it’s largely the same as the 7840U that powered prior handhelds, with the same Radeon 780M iGPU inside. But like the ROG Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go, it does upgrade to LPDDR5X-7500 memory, which seemingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">gave the Legion a slight performance bump</a> over the original Ally — and at a more modest 1080p resolution. </p><p>Less pleasingly, Zotac appears to have outfitted it with a modest 48.5 watt-hour battery pack as well, smaller than that of the Steam Deck OLED and vastly smaller than the 80Wh packs that Asus and MSI just announced — and its 7-inch 120Hz OLED screen <a href="https://x.com/carygolomb/status/1797848535054086492">doesn’t support variable refresh rate</a> any more than the Steam Deck’s one did. It does sound nice and bright at 800 nits, however, and I’m intrigued by the programmable jog dials.</p><div><figcaption><em>Zotac’s Zone one-pager.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Zotac</cite></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23733592/frore-airjet-zotac-mini-desktop-pc-zbox-pi430aj-price">As you may know</a>, Zotac was one of the first companies to try AirJet’s intriguing solid-state cooling tech in a mini-PC, and <em>PCWorld</em>’s Adam Murray took the opportunity to ask if Zotac was planning to use the tech in a handheld, too. But while AirJet maker Frore Systems <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23975368/frore-airjet-apple-macbook-air-fanless-mems#:~:text=Frore%20seems%20to%20think%20AirJets%20could%20fit%20into%20a%20Steam%20Deck%2C%20too.">seems to think it’d work</a>, Zotac suggested the current AirJet isn’t yet designed to cool chips as high wattage as the 8840U — and that cost might also be a concern. For now, the Zone has a single traditional fan and a couple of smallish vents to help keep it cool.</p><p>According <a href="https://www.geeknetic.es/Noticia/31877/ZOTAC-nos-ensena-su-GAME-ZONE-en-el-COMPUTEX-lanzamiento-previsto-para-septiembre-por-800-euros.html">to <em>Geeknetic</em></a>, the Zone should cost around $800 in September of this year. That’s on the high end of consumer gaming handhelds, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">though the Ally X</a>, with its dramatically bigger battery, is also launching at that price.</p><p>Zotac, if you’re reading this: we’re happy to get the details from you next time!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/contraband-a-ways-off-report-avalanche-shuts-down-multiple-studios/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>What’s the deal with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/contraband/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contraband</a>, the Xbox-published co-op game coming from Just Cause and Rage 2 developer Avalanche Studios? The project was announced back in 2021, and that’s about all we’ve heard about it. That said, with a big <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> coming up, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-is-targeting-2025-contraband-might-launch-this-year-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old rumors that Contraband may be targeting 2024</a>, some have got their hopes up that we may see the game soon.</p>
<p>Well, you may want to cool your jets. On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Oc0705wD0WA?si=qWrLIOzeNi4Gafzy&amp;t=3705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent episode of Colt Eastwood’s Xbox News Cast</a>, one of the hosts Magg said Contraband isn’t coming until “well into” 2025 as the game is still in a rough state.</p>
<p><em>“I've been told it's been delayed. It's going to be delayed well into 2025, could be the end of 2025. But, the people that I know, the footage that I saw, the people that played the game and sent me all their [...] impromptu reviews of what they played, they said the game is fun, it was great. It was a very early build. [...] Like, the cars didn't have drivers in them, you couldn't see their heads, it was literally ghost cars driving around.”</em></p>
<p>Now, this Magg doesn’t necessarily have much of a leaking track record, but during the podcast, The Verge’s Tom Warren, who does have a long, reliable track record, popped up in the comments section to confirm “Contraband is a ways off, for sure.”</p>
<p>Of course, take this all with a grain of salt for now, but it sounds like Contraband is not something Xbox is preparing to launch in the immediate future. In related news, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/just-cause-developer-avalanche-closing-two-studios-and-laying-off-50-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche recently announced the closure of two North American studios</a> located in New York and Montreal, resulting in around 50 layoffs (that represents around a 10th of their total workforce). This leaves Avalanche with three main European studios located in Stockholm, Liverpool, and Malmo, Sweeden. Whether this downsizing has anything to do with the somewhat slow progress being made on Contraband is unknown.</p>
<p>Contraband is currently slated to release on PC and Xbox Series X/S. An official launch window has not been announced.</p>

                <p>Harvest Moon: One World is getting a new Complete Edition for Nintendo Switch that will bundle the base game with all post-launch DLC for $30.

So far, the Yeti plush is only listed as a bonus if you preorder directly from Natsume; the Amazon listing does not mention the bonus plush. However, since Amazon doesn't charge for preorders until your order ships, you could secure your copy early at both locations and wait to see if the plush is confirmed for Amazon, then cancel one of the orders before launch.</p><div title="6523580 - Harvest Moon: One World Complete" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2391" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523580 - Harvest Moon: One World Complete" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Harvest Moon: One World Complete</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Harvest Moon: One World Complete is an expanded version of the game, which originally launched in 2021 for Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The initial release featured five explorable world regions and 10 romanceable NPCs, but the post-launch paid DLC boosted that content to six total regions and 12 romanceable characters, alongside additional house decorations, pets, and other items to collect. All that extra content is included with the new Complete version. You can preorder Harvest Moon: Complete Edition for $30 at Amazon, or at <a href="https://natsumestore.com/products/pre-order-harvest-moon-one-world-complete-with-free-sasquatch-plush" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Natsume's online store</a>. </p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Harvest Moon: One World iterates on the long-running series' farming and life-sim gameplay, turning it into a more exploration-based adventure with elements that seem heavily inspired by Pokemon. Players create their own character and then embark on a quest to collect Harvest Wisps hidden throughout the world that unlock new crops in their "Vegedex" that can be farmed with the new portable "expando-farm."</p><p dir="ltr">While the game was met with mixed reception from critics and fans, this new Complete edition's $30 price tag and comprehensive content package will likely be the best way to experience the game for Switch players. That said, if you don't want to wait--or don't play on Switch--you can also grab the original release at Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-One-World-Xbox/dp/B09BDWPNKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 on Xbox One</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-One-World-Standard-PlayStation/dp/B08FBVCGPF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-way-to-start-the-final-shape-for-new-and-returning-destiny-2-players/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fastest-way-to-start-the-final-shape-for-new-and-returning-destiny-2-players<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="449" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you are a frequent player of <em>Destiny 2</em>, you’ll be caught up and ready to go as soon as you are able to get into <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. However, if you’ve never played <em>Destiny 2</em> or haven’t played in a long time, tons of content has been added and it can be a bit difficult figuring out how to get into the new expansion content. This is the fastest way to start <em>The Final Shape</em> for those new and returning <em>Destiny 2</em> players.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-skip-ahead-to-destiny-2-the-final-shape-content" data-injectable="false">How to skip ahead to <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> content</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="true">As a new player who has not played <em>Destiny 2</em> at all, you will have one extra step over those that are returning after a long hiatus. Create your character and start <em>Destiny 2</em> which will plop you into the Cosmodrome region on Earth. This is essentially the beginning of the game, but don’t worry; you only have to do the first mission. Once you reach the end, you’ll get a quest that tasks you with speaking to Commander Shaw which is also located in the same Cosmodrome region as you and should be highlighted on your map.</p>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Once you have completed the initial tutorial mission, here is the fastest way to start <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion content in <em>Destiny 2</em>:</p> <ol data-found-items="4" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false"> <li>Find Commander Shaw.</li> <li>Skip the New Light quest and acquire your New Light Kit at the Tower.</li> <li>Visit Commander Zavala at the Tower and reach Guardian Rank 2.</li> <li>Return to Zavala to start The Final Shape quest and unlock The Pale Heart.</li> </ol> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">Here is a detailed walkthrough for each step you must complete to unlock and access <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion as soon as possible:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-find-commander-shaw" data-injectable="false">Find Commander Shaw</h3> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">Speak to Shaw and he will tell you to sync up with his ship, which is located right behind him and to the left. This will unlock two new quests, one titled A Guardian Rises which tasks you with progressing through the original <em>Destiny 2</em> campaign, and another called Learning Light which is what you are looking for. Once you start the Learning Light quest you can return to the flag where you synched with Shaw’s ship, and you will now see the option to Skip New Light.</p>
 <h3 id="h-skip-new-light-and-acquire-your-new-light-kit" data-injectable="false">Skip New Light and acquire your New Light Kit</h3> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Doing so will skip ahead and allow you to bypass completing the story missions, which will unlock the Tower and a new campaign quest specific to your class. Visit the Tower and head to the class NPC marked by your quest objective to acquire your New Light Kit which is essentially a set of starter gear that you would normally have the equivalent of if you actually played through the original campaign story missions.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-visit-zavala-at-the-tower-and-reach-guardian-rank-2" data-injectable="false">Visit Zavala at the Tower and reach Guardian Rank 2</h3> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="813" data-injectable="true">Afterward, you will be tasked with heading to Zavala to continue the Spark of Hope questline. It will seem as though it’s making you go through the entire quest line, but I assure you it’s not. Zavala gives you the objective of hitting Guardian Rank 2, which simply requires you to open your Character screen, hit the Journey tab, then click to level up to Guardian Rank 2. Head to the Ironwood Tree right next to you at the Tower and you will officially progress to rank 2 and complete the objective.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-return-to-zavala-and-start-the-final-shape-quest-and-unlock-the-pale-heart-destination" data-injectable="false">Return to Zavala and start The Final Shape quest and unlock The Pale Heart destination</h3> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Finally, head back to Zavala which is nearby on the Tower and speak to him. Confirm you’ve reached Guardian Rank 2 and as long as you have purchased <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> expansion, he will now give you the breadcrumb quest to start the expansion titled The Final Shape and will also unlock the new area for the expansion called The Pale Heart.</p>
 <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="98" data-injectable="false">Congratulations, you’re all caught up and ready to start playing <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>!</p>

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-launch-trailer-has-me-asking-a-lot-of-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em> is the game’s final major expansion and adds everything a fan could want and more. There are new enemies, a brand new location to explore, and a showdown with the biggest baddie the universe has ever seen, The Witness. </p> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Players will battle against The Witness in the new raid that <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> adds. This raid, Salation’s Edge, will see players head out and face The Witness in a colossal battle between light and darkness. It’ll settle the fate of this universe once and for all. However, before players can even contemplate jumping into the raid, they’ll need to reach the right Power Level. This is the in-game level of their Guardian and is based on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their gear</a> and weapon levels, meaning we’ve all got some grinding to do. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-power-level-do-you-need-to-play-the-salvation-s-edge-raid-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">What Power Level do you need to play the Salvation’s Edge raid in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">To play the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salvation’s Edge raid</a> in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, players must be at least <strong>Power Level 1965</strong>. Players have three days to reach this level, which will not be easy. Playing through the entire campaign on Legendary will get you most of the way, but there’s also an Exotic Quest and, of course, a lot of grinding you can do in the new activities in The Pale Heart to help you reach that lofty Power Level. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to grind Power Levels in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">To grind Power Levels in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> in preparation for the Salvation’s Edge raid, players need to log in daily and complete every activity that will give them powerful rewards. This includes weekly and daily rewards for activities everywhere in the game, be that Crucible, Gambit, Strikes, or The Pale Heart. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Note that you should be doing this after completing <em>The Final Shape</em> campaign on Legendary. If you don’t, you’re going to struggle to hit the required Power Level in time for the raid’s launch. If you don’t mind, you can grind away in the background without stressing. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">These rewards will give you gear that’s guaranteed to be stronger than what you currently hold, so equip your most powerful items every time you close in on a powerful reward. The new location will also be filled with new activities to complete for your profile, many of which could end up giving you more of the gear you seek. </p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">The one thing I always do is make sure I have as many bounties as possible. These help you grind out Season Pass levels but also count towards powerful rewards with all vendors. The more you complete, the higher your chances of getting a random yet very strong piece of gear that’ll help you close in on that raid-ready Power Level. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">Finally, keep on top of your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-artifact-perks-coming-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artifact</a>. This item opens up some great mods you can use on your gear and weapons, and every level you earn for it counts towards your Power Level. If you’re grinding for the raid, even a single Power Level added here counts for those desperate to play on day one. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to start the Salvation’s Edge raid in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">To start the Salvation’s Edge raid in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, players must launch the game, open the map, and pick it from the available activities. You should be able to find it in The Pale Heart location, which is inside of the Traveler in the middle of the screen. </p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="false">Note that the raid won’t be available until <strong>June 7, 20224, at 1 p.m. ET</strong>. This is when Contest Mode will be enabled for all the registered teams to hop in and try to be the first in the world to complete it. It’s unknown what will happen once the raid has been completed, but recent raids have all changed the game world in some way, opening up new activities. So it’s worth keeping an eye on the standings even if you’re not playing. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the TTRPG community, Roll20 is one of the largest virtual tabletop platforms on the market. It boasts one of the largest libraries of resources and hosts millions of games every day. Now, that platform will have more resources with an official Roll20 Demiplane acquisition.</p>

<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition announcement</h2>

<p>The announcement of the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition was covered in a report by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/roll20-announces-purchase-of-demiplane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Comicbook.com</a>. According to the report, the purchase goes into effect today, providing Roll20 with a suite of character creation tools that can work in tandem with the VTT and online marketplace DriveThruRPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=roQyzWMV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=tRvN-0Rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kind of convenience may be coming to Roll20.</figcaption></figure><p>For those unaware, Demiplane is a VTT known for its robust suite of character-creation tools and RPG resource compendiums. Its closest competition in terms of convenience and usability on the market is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-buys-up-dd-beyond-from-fandom">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. Demiplane's supported titles include Paizo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus">Pathfinder</a>, Paradox Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane"><em>World of Darkness</em></a>, and Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/demiplane-partners-with-darrington-press-to-launch-candela-obscura-nexus"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

<p>In an interview with Roll20's CEO, Ankit Lai explained the reason for the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition. Lai explained that it was to further Roll20's goal of creating a seamless user experience. This aligns with the platform's past partnerships, providing user-created content through <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dms-guild-content-now-on-roll20">DMs Guild</a> or easy battlemap creation through <a href="https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/16979743281943-Getting-Started-with-Dungeon-Scrawl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dungeon Scrawl</a>.</p>

<p>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition won't have any immediate impact on users, but Demiplane CEO Peter Romenesko noted that merged companies will look to close the difference between their two platforms very quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What you'll see is a very concentrated effort to bring the distance between each of these different solutions that are now under the Roll20 brand, really start to bring them closer. Both in digital proximity so that all of a sudden you can start to use these things across the whole platform, whether you're playing in person or online....You may not notice [these changes] one by one, but it's something that we're really committed to. In addition, we'll continue to bring out a whole bunch of great games on our platform and find out really unique ways to bring Demiplane into DriveThruRPG and the virtual tabletop."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unclear at time of writing which game systems will support Demiplane character sheet integration on Roll20. However, it is confirmed this acquisition will allow the support of playtest material for upcoming systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>.</p>

<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em> fast approaching, the development team at Square Enix are doing everything in their power to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-begins-testing-cross-region-data-center-travel-later-this-month/">ease the expected congestion</a> when it comes to logging in around release.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The latest move is to provide players with more choices for their home world by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/93750e4b0d6d5a4faf6a00dee199082392f1a754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creating four new worlds</a> on the existing North American Data Center, Dynamis. The DC has been running at half capacity since its launch in 2022, with four worlds, as opposed to the normal eight per DC.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The four new worlds will be added on June 11 at 3 a.m. PDT / 6 a.m. EST, bringing the following new worlds live and ready for new or existing players to populate:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Cuchulainn</li> <li>Golem</li> <li>Kraken</li> <li>Rafflesia</li> </ul> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">On top of boosting the capacity of North American servers, the four new worlds will also have completely empty housing districts, which is potentially the most exciting aspect of this news for a lot of people.</p> <h2 id="h-how-housing-works-on-new-worlds-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How housing works on ‘new’ worlds in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Let’s face it, getting a house in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is never easy, even with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-housing-lottery-explained/">Lottery system</a> which was introduced in patch 6.1. However, being an early entrant into a brand new world can significantly boost your chances of getting your dream Eorzean home.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">All of these up for grabs plots will all be subject to the same conditions as any other as part of the Housing Lottery, with wards 1 to 9 being exclusively available to those seeking a base for their FC, while wards 10 to 24 will be reserved for players wanting a private residential oasis.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">For those who are interested in transferring to one of these new worlds but worried about giving up any property they already own on your current world, don’t fret. If you choose to up sticks, you’ll actually be eligible for a pretty hefty boost in funds. Not only will the full price of the estate you own be fully reimbursed, but you’ll also get 3,000,000 Gil for your willingness to leave your old world behind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">In the case of apartments, you’ll get the 500,000 Gil that you paid for the apartment back and also a bonus of another 500,000 Gil.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">However, it’s worth noting that if you choose to do this, you’ll need to keep hold of your current property while going through the Home World Transfer process. If you give up the rights to your property before the process is completed, you won’t be eligible to receive any bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">On top of these housing perks, there are also some other good reasons to transfer to a new world:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"> <li>The <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/option_service/world_transfer_service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home World Transfer Service</a> is free of charge (usually costs $18.00 USD)</li> <li>You’ll receive 10 Gold Chocobo Feathers, which can be exchanged for the following: <ul> <li>Managarm mount (8 feathers)</li> <li>Amber Draught Chocobo (8 feathers)</li> <li>Twintania Neurolink Key (15 feathers)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Double EXP bonus until level 80 is achieved</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="151" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The 2024 World Series of <em>Warzone</em> has officially kicked off, and it didn’t take long for chaos to ensue in the first round of qualifying matches. </p> <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzon</em>e pro Fifakill posted a clip on <a href="https://x.com/Fifakill_/status/1798024779175543030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> of CHOWH and his teammates getting killed by a loadout drop during a <em>World Series of Warzone</em> EU qualifying match. Despite driving in an LTV, one of the best-armored vehicles in the battle royale, the trio stood no chance against a loadout drop that fell from the sky. Upon driving into the crate, the vehicle blew up and all three players got downed. To add insult to injury, the squad got finished off by an airstrike. CHOWH could do nothing but sit in disbelief as he saw his team fall victim to quite an unfortunate turn of events. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">BubbleCT and his trio called in the loadout drop, and he <a href="https://x.com/BubbleCT_/status/1798030870814814539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, “Shout out to our loadout, lmao.” Bubble had no intention of using the loadout drop of a weapon, but he certainly won’t apologize, as every kill matters in the <em>World Series of Warzon</em>e. From June 4-12, NA and EU qualifiers take place. Out of the 80 teams for both regions, only 68 will move on based on their performances throughout 15 matches. </p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="false">That group of 68 is divided even further based on their performance during the qualifying stages, so every game matters. Hence, losing one of those 15 matches like this is unquestionably frustrating. Unfortunately for CHOWH, his trio currently sits in 30th place with 28 points after the first five matches. And that’s before the second group of 40 teams play their first five matches. Luckily there are still 10 matches left, and CHOWH has plenty of time to regroup. </p>

Players sent thousands of emails to Valve and outlets like <em>Kotaku </em>and <em>IGN,</em> trying to get attention on the issue. And it worked! Valve, the company behind Steam and <em>Half-Life</em>, acknowledged the bot problem and said it was working on fixing things. That was about two years ago and uh...well, the bots are still here and still making the game hard to play. </p><h2 id="h3192"><a id=""></a>Fans want Valve to save <em>Team Fortress 2</em></h2><p>On June 3, a new fan campaign started up. And like last time, players are trying to get Valve to step in and do something about all the annoying bots. This time, the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://save.tf/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fix TF2" campaign</a></span> is asking for player signatures, which will be delivered to Valve in the future. So far the site has collected over 210,000 signatures and the number keeps climbing. </p><p>“There’s no putting it lightly, <em>Team Fortress 2</em> is in an unacceptable state, and Valve’s apathy in dealing with the issue is nothing short of appalling,” claims a message on the “Fix TF2" site. </p><p>The campaign’s mission statement asks Valve to implement updated anti-cheat measures for the aging <em>TF2</em>, which still makes money every year via microtransactions. The fans also want an open line of communication with Valve about the state of the game and the bot problem.</p><p>As someone who has spent years emailing Valve for comments and answers as part of my job and received very few responses, I wish you all good luck with getting them to communicate more. Speaking of which, <em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Valve about <em>TF2</em>'s bots. </p><p>To help get Valve’s attention, the website is asking fans to share stories, screenshots, and clips of bots in <em>TF2 </em>on social media. It is also asking fans to share the campaign’s website, too. Nowhere on the site does it ask fans to review-bomb <em>TF2</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but that’s also happening right now as well</a></span>, likely as a result of angry players wanting to get Valve to do something. </p><p>Valve has yet to officially respond to the campaign as of June 4, 2024. The official <em>TF2 </em>Twitter account’s last tweet was... <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last time Valve replied</a></span> to fans complaining about bots in 2022. So we shall see if <em>TF2</em>'s second tweet in nearly two years is yet another promise that fixes are coming. Last time that worked to calm fans down. This time...I’m not sure.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>I tend to have an indie or two each year that I don't shut up about. Five years ago, Blue Manchu's roguelite strategy-shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/void-bastards/" data-ref-id="5000-489272">Void Bastards</a>, was <em>that</em> game for me. Now, studio Blue Manchu is back with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-bastards/" data-ref-id="5000-611497">Wild Bastards</a>, a spiritual successor that retains the sci-fi of the first one but adds a western element to it while expanding and deepening the game's systems. On top of that, the replacement-level characters, who served Void Bastards satirical story well, are swapped out for a Dirty (baker's) Dozen of voiced characters, each of whom has their own personalities and relationships with others in the gang.</p><p>Put it all together, and you have a game that seems, in my admittedly limited sample, to be even better than its excellent predecessor. With the full game due to launch later this year, I caught up with Blue Manchu's creative director Ben Lee to talk about how the team landed on another game in the loose "Bastards" series, what lessons it learned from that first game that made Wild Bastards better off, and where the studio may go from here as it continues to create visually captivating and mechanically complex games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEmsVc9GxrE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cEmsVc9GxrE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>GameSpot: Wild Bastards has a lot of the same DNA as Void Bastards, but it's not a sequel. Can you talk about how this game found its shape in the years since Void Bastards? When did the team decide to develop another game in the same genre?</strong></p><p>Lee: We started pre-production about three months after the release of Void Bastards. We started out with a fairly broad remit, and the game took a long time to fully take shape.</p><p>Wild Bastards is all about playing a myriad of distinct characters, instead of a procession of random prisoners. We put a lot of effort into their unique playstyles, visuals and fully-voiced dialogue as you play through the narrative campaign.</p><p>Wild Bastards certainly has strategy/shooter DNA, but we have focused on much more complex combat encounters this time. The combat spaces are no longer just corridors and rooms, and the strategic factors that tie into each encounter go much deeper. Most importantly, the enemy variety and behaviors are significantly more varied and nuanced than the monsters in Void Bastards.</p><p><strong>Were there any obvious successes you knew would carry over from Void Bastards when you were developing Wild Bastards? On the flipside, were there any lessons VB taught you that you sought to rework or even remove in WB?</strong></p><p>There were plenty of both! The main thing we carried over was probably more on the technical and production side. We didn’t have to completely rethink the way we built the game thanks to all the problem solving we did on Void Bastards.</p><p>Outside of that, we often internally referred to things that we felt did or did not work well in Void Bastards, but we did not think of this game as a Void Bastards variant or sequel. We wanted it to be unshackled from that game as far as our design space went.</p><p>The initial versions of the game did not even have space travel as it is implemented now. It was much more of a huge planetary map exploration thing. But as time went on, we felt that we had more to offer in the strategy hybrid area and we leaned back that way instead of going a more RPG route.</p><p><strong>More broadly, the roguelite/roguelike space is so densely populated--on PC especially. What's it like sharing digital real estate with so many games trying to appeal to similar players?</strong></p><p>There is not quite yet an oversaturation of strategy-shooter hybrid roguelikes as far as we see things. Maybe that will change in future, but for now I think there’s plenty of room for different takes on the games in this loose genre.</p><p><strong>Void Bastards was inspired by BioShock and System Shock 2. What are the main inspirations for Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>I can only speak on the thematic influences to the look and feel. I was raised by a mother who loved sci-fi and a father who loved westerns. Wild Bastards creative direction was inspired mostly by cinema. Namely the Sergio Leone Dollars trilogy, The Magnificent Seven (1960), Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), MTV’s Liquid Television from the late '90s, Muse’s Knights of Cydonia music video, Suspiria (1977) and Mandy (2018).</p><p><strong>Does Blue Manchu have aspirations beyond games of this size and scope or might you always want to create games such as Void Bastards and Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>As long as we can make games, we will make games. If we end up in a position where we can make games with more resources, it's certainly something we’d be open to.</p><p><strong>To that end, is there a future third Bastards game in the team's mind? After space sci-fi and westerns, is there another narrative genre you'd like to explore?</strong></p><p>Yes. But it’s a secret for now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311282-enemies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311282" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311282-enemies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311282"></a><figcaption>Each gunslinger has their own ultimate ability and can otherwise be kitted out with buffs and gear to suit different situations.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311282-enemies.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311283-wildbastards-bayoumap.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311284-wildbastards-warp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311285-wildbastards-outlaw.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311286-wildbastards-equip.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311287-wildbastards-hostilenohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311288-wildbastards-bayounohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311289-wildbastards-desertnohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311290-wildbastards-roulette.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311291-spiderrosaexplosion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311283,1300-4311284,1300-4311285,1300-4311286,1300-4311287,1300-4311288,1300-4311289,1300-4311290,1300-4311291" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311283-wildbastards-bayoumap.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311284-wildbastards-warp.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311285-wildbastards-outlaw.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311286-wildbastards-equip.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311287-wildbastards-hostilenohud.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311288-wildbastards-bayounohud.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311289-wildbastards-desertnohud.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311290-wildbastards-roulette.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311291-spiderrosaexplosion.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311283-wildbastards-bayoumap.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311284-wildbastards-warp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311285-wildbastards-outlaw.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311286-wildbastards-equip.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311287-wildbastards-hostilenohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311288-wildbastards-bayounohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311289-wildbastards-desertnohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311290-wildbastards-roulette.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311291-spiderrosaexplosion.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Both games have a certain sense of humor that prevents them from feeling gloomy or serious, even when I'm running for my life. Can you talk about why the team leans toward this lighter tone and why you think it works for these games?</strong></p><p>Void Bastards was originally very serious and quite depressing in tone. Midway through the project, we decided to keep it quite dark but approach it from a more comedic angle. Cara and I both have a lot of appreciation for Douglas Adams, Terry Gilliam, and Red Dwarf, so that was what got us to bring her on board to write.</p><p>Wild Bastards was originally supposed to be more serious, but once we began the writing process with our old friend Jerry [Holkin, writer for Void Bastards], his sense of humor naturally worked its way into the fiction and dialogue. None of us complained.</p><p><strong>Did you ever consider moving away from the comic-book art style for Wild Bastards? Why did you end up back with this style in the end?</strong></p><p>The conceptual designs come from the same person (me), but Wild Bastards is actually less directly a comic book than Void Bastards. There is no cover page, no panel borders or visual onomatopoeia sound effects for example. Wild Bastards is more in line with a kind of acid trippy traditional animation as visual style. I would still be keen to return to a more intricate comic book/graphic novel look for a future game, to see how much further we could push it.</p><p><strong>WB's systems feel so intricate and layered. Is there ever a point in development when you must rein it in to avoid overcomplicating the game? How do you know when the game's systems have the right depth without becoming too deep?</strong></p><p>Short answer: Yes. I think all our games are too complicated at some point in development and it’s that editing process of trimming and refining that is so important to arriving at a final experience that feels right.</p><p>We had a lot more playtesting and user feedback on Wild Bastards, which had a much stronger impact on the final game than previous titles. Sometimes it’s the things you take out that have a bigger positive impact than all the stuff you cram in.</p><p><strong>The game features 13 playable gunslingers. I assume others were designed but ultimately left out. What made these characters the ones to make the cut? Do you have any favorites, or any expectations as to who players will gravitate toward?</strong></p><p>Ultimately it was how much fun the outlaw was to play and their place in the overall meta that determined which ones we kept. We started with in-game mockups for each one before going ahead with visual design or dialogue. When drawing the concepts, I had definite favorites, but by the time we had them all playable and voiced, I loved them all equally. That’s not a cop-out answer; it’s more of a testament to the way they developed through writing and recording.</p><p>Playtesters have had a really varied spread of opinions over the most effective or favorite character to use, which is exactly what we wanted to see. Some outlaws seem OP until they run into a particular set of enemies, or useless until certain strategies are discovered. It’s this variety and depth that really sets the game apart from our previous efforts.</p><p><strong>Do you have any post-launch plans for Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>We are currently full speed ahead on getting the game ready to ship, which requires all of our attention… But check back with us post-launch for answers to that question!</p><hr><p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660840/Wild_Bastards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist Wild Bastards on Steam</a> before it arrives on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Switch on September 12.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring's</a> highly anticipated DLC, Shadow Of The Erdtree, is quickly approaching. As we get closer to its June 21 release date, more information about the DLC is beginning to surface, such as how many new bosses lie ahead and how a new feature will allow you to adjust the game’s difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will notice a new menu option called Shadow Realm Blessing whenever they visit a Guidance of Grace. This will serve as a new progression system for their character that will allow them to use the DLC's new powers. It'll even act as a difficulty modifier to ensure players aren't overpowered despite their level. That said, returning characters won't be as strong in the newer areas. So, they'll need to upgrade themselves using Scadutree Blessings.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to all these changes, the Shadow Of The Erdtree will see you take on 10 new bosses. Similar to the base game, not all boss fights are required for you to finish the story. But as of the time of this writing, it's unclear which bosses players will be able to skip.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadow Of The Erdtree is scheduled to drop later this month on June 21.

Upgrade your trusty truck and visit a whole world of new destinations together. Discover fresh fruits and vegetables on each island of the Gustum archipelago, learn their customs, and cook meals that will make someone’s day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does one actually capture an engaging snapshot of what cooking is, and what kinds of challenges and unforeseen complications show up in this neck of the woods? Come along on our journey of designing the cooking system for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It sounds straightforward enough: Forage an apple, cut it into bite-sized chunks, and compose with some kind of intent in a bowl. If you are feeling adventurous, you might even add a sliced banana to the mix. Sprinkle a moving truck on top, and it’s bound to be a memorable experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First of all, who makes a salad with fruit? That’s as obscene as interchanging burger and sandwich.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second of all, isn’t it a little early to foreshadow in the introduction?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the menu for tonight are wildcards like:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quantum Entanglement! Compositions! Processes! … and Apple Crouton Soup?</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Prototypes">Early Prototypes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In general, our philosophy was to try to rely as much on physics as we could to provide a solid layer of interactivity with the mechanics.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Cutting">Cutting</h3><p>Dynamic Cutting, lots of pieces. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Frying">Frying</h3><p>Frying up a little piece of Apple. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the earlier stages of the game, we used the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/dynamic-mesh-cutter-208384">Dynamic Mesh Cutter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> plugin, which lets you dynamically cut up objects in runtime. We spliced that together with some basic knife skills and a bit of hand-holding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, you fry the bits and chunks in the frying pan until their “cookedness” is above a certain threshold; push your luck, and it might get burnt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You want an apple and ginger smoothie?” Let me scrap together enough chunks and bits of apple and ginger to make sure I meet the demands imposed upon me by the recipe.</span></p><p>Blend the little bits to make a lil smoothie. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stick your pile of chunks into a blender, and voila. You’ve filled a cup one-third of the way with some weird combination of liquids.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Individually any of these prototypes could pass as fun interactions or mechanics. Combine them and, fast-forward, the result is a messy kitchen with the floor full of various bits and chunks of fruit, mysterious liquids, and dubious amounts of state.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How would you represent the taste of a piece of Banana in code? What if the Banana had been fried, boiled and then blended into a liquid, then combined with an apple and ginger smoothie? How many pieces of Banana do you need to contribute to the taste of the dish? How much taste is added by being fried or being burnt? It gets messy and overwhelming quite fast, and it’s so arbitrarily granular.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The old me would have been confused, eagerly plotting out the course for some thin and long pasta shapes. For the new me, it’s simply a fried banana, apple, and ginger smoothie.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the great things that derived from the ideation and prototyping phase we had on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was finding the correct level of zoom or the correct scope for the cooking simulation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feeling</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of cooking that is important, not the preciseness of the simulation. Thomas, our game director, called it “Hollywood Cooking.” Whenever I think of that phrase, my mouth curls into a grin.</span></p><p>Chili and Garlic Stir Fry.

The general process was mostly talking through the different steps food would have to take to end up in a dish that could be served and evaluated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We thought up a dish that would touch upon as many of the previous systems as possible—a sort of minimum viable dish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But before we get into that, it’s about time we go down a level.</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Processes.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Verbs that represent the transformations the Food go through.

It requires input to be enabled (Externally, through a button, for example), but after that it can be left to its own devices.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tools</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are processes that can be triggered through Player interaction, like the Knife. It requires repeated input from the Player to perform any action. It also fetches the input directly instead of relying on external systems like an Appliance.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FoodObject</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is our representation of an edible object. A food object usually consists of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Archetype</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or the template: the gold standard banana, the pink-lady standard apple.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>State</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the representation of the Food Object (the apple is sliced and fried).</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Visuals,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the visual representation of the FoodObject in its current state.</span></p><p>Ever wondered what an Apple looks like in Fruitbus?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-masterworking-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diablo-4-masterworking-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="249" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s</em> endgame upgrade system is a little convoluted at first blush. Since most casual players are butting up against The Pit and earning Masterworking materials, let’s do a quick rundown of how it all works and why you should do it.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-masterwork" data-injectable="false">How to Masterwork</h2> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">First thing’s first, you’ll need to have unlocked The Pit and completed at least one Tier 1 run-through. The quest “Pit of the Artificer” appears when you reach World Tier 4, and you can check <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Pit unlock guide </a>for more details. Once that’s done, head to the Blacksmith to use your earned Obducite to Masterwork your first piece of gear as part of the questline. </p> <p data-characters="85" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Masterworking requires materials found in the pit, which drop in the following tiers:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Rank 1-4: Obducite; drops in Pit tiers 1-30</li> <li>Rank 5-8: Ingolith; drops in Pit tiers 31-60</li> <li>Rank 9-12: Neathiron; drops in Pit tier 61+</li> </ul> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">These materials can be converted into one another at the Alchemist, with higher level materials converting into increased numbers of lower ones (1 Ingolith will convert into 3 Obducite, for examples). Use this to save time if you’re blasting high-tier Pit runs! Just don’t forget to bring along the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-runeshards-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 required Runeshards.</a></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Masterwork upgrades</h2> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">After this first Masterworking rank, that same item can be upgraded a grand total of 12 times, resulting in the following bonuses:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Each rank gives all base affixes a +5% boost</li> <li>Every fourth rank gives one random affix a +25% boost <ul> <li>This +25% boost can be applied three times to one affix, or spread out across multiple over the course of Masterworking</li> </ul> </li> <li>At Masterwork rank 12, you’ll have gained a 45% increase to all base affixes, plus an additional 75% spread across one to three affixes</li> </ul> <h2 data-injectable="false">Masterworking tips</h2> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Masterworking all your 925 item level gear that has Greater Affixes that suit your build is essential to progressing further into The Pit, but you should focus on reaching rank 4 on all pieces, then rank 8, then finally rank 12. Don’t waste time and effort trying to jack a piece up to rank 12 before anything else is upgraded! The power gains in those early ranks spread across multiple pieces of gear will far outweigh a completed one.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">Don’t forget, salvaging a Masterworked item will return all invested materials <em>except</em> those you used to get it to the current rank. So if you salvage a rank 3 item, you’ll get back 30 Obducite, but lose the 30 you used to get it to rank 3. </p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="false">You can also reset the Masterwork of an item using some materials plus a staggering 5 million gold if you’re unhappy with how the bonus affix boosts pan out, but I’d save that for your tippity-top min-maxing later on. </p>

Try to bring a Cryo character to freeze the Suanni when it imbues itself with Hydro. Then, once frozen, hit it with a blunt attack to trigger Shatter and stun the Suanni.</p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Sethos needs 46 Cloudseam Scales to reach max Ascension. This means challenging the Solitary Suanni about 18 times at World Level 8.</p> <h3 id="h-trishiraite" data-injectable="false">Trishiraite</h3> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Trishiraite are clusters of red crystals found in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-find-trishiraite-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upper deserts of Sumeru</a>.

 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Sethos will need a total of 168 Trishiraites to reach level 90. There are only 57 Trishiraites in Teyvat, and they respawn 48 hours after collecting, so you’ll need to make three runs in order to get enough. If you’re short on Trhshiraite and impatient, try asking a friend if you can farm in their world.</p> <figure data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/why-warzone-players-should-use-the-holger-26-post-dg-58-lsw-nerf/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-warzone-players-should-use-the-holger-26-post-dg-58-lsw-nerf<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Raven Software left no stone unturned after nerfing the DG-58 LSW a second time, taking the LMG out of long-range meta contention in <em>Warzone</em>. Fortunately, the Holger 26 performs closely statistically and could take over as the new king of the battle royale. </p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">When <em>Modern Warfare 3’s </em>iteration of <em>Warzone </em>launched, the DG-58 LSW was a solid but unforgettable LMG that got outclassed by other class options. Everything changed in Season 3, as the new JAK Nightshade conversion kit transformed the slow and bulky LMG into a versatile AR. It didn’t take long for <em>Warzone</em> players to catch on, forcing Raven Software to respond accordingly. </p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mcw-jak-raven-kit-takes-over-warzone-meta-after-dg-58-lsw-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 Reloaded update</a>, the DG-58 LSW JAK Nightshade conversion kit had its damage values, max damage range, and headshot multipliers nerfed. Some players suspected this Nerf would knock the LMG out of contention, but the weapon continued to top popularity charts and get used consistently in lobbies and by pro players. </p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">So, to put down the behemoth once and for all, the DDG-58 LSW got <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-june-4-update-patch-notes-dg-58-lsw-nerf-dna-bomb-fix-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerfed again</a> as the weapon’s damage values suffered another substantial blow. This time, we don’t expect the LMG to still find much more use after the patch. If players aren’t sure what to use next, look no further than the Holger 26. </p> <h2 id="h-best-holger-26-loadout-in-warzone-season-4" data-injectable="false">Best Holger 26 loadout in <em>Warzone</em> Season 4</h2> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">TrueGameData shared the best possible Holger 26 loadout on <a href="https://x.com/TrueGameData/status/1798031547557396489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Holger Factory Barrel </li> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>VT-7 Spitfire Suppressor </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>JAK Glassless Optic </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Ascent Lord Stick </li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Bruen Heavy Support Grip </li> </ul> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">TrueGameData tested time-to-kill speeds after the DG-58 LSW nerf and concluded that the Holger 26 and Holger 556 perform better now. From zero to around 35 meters, the Holger 26 has a time-to-kill speed of just over 750 milliseconds. Meanwhile, the DG-58 LSW has the same time-to-kill speed as the Holger 26 up to around 18 meters but falls off massively after.</p>
 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">In comparison, the Holger 556 leads all three weapons with a 714-millisecond time-to-kill speed up to around 38 meters, but the Holger 26 has a larger magazine, which makes it easier to down multiple enemies at once. The JAK Annihilator Bullpup conversion kit for the Pulemyot 762 and MTZ-762 are also great options, but the Holger 26 has every characteristic of a powerful long-range meta weapon. </p>

<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It seems like every few days there’s more news about layoffs hitting video game developers, and today it’s Behaviour Interactive’s turn.&nbsp;The company announced via <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">press release</a> its plan to cut up to 95 jobs. The company’s Montreal studio will be hit particularly hard – 70 of the cut employees will be coming from there.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Up until this year, Behaviour was experiencing some incredible growth. The company’s own press release acknowledges that it’s more than doubled in size over the past years, going from 575 to 1,300 employees. “Over the same period, the greater gaming industry has also witnessed remarkable growth,” the company writes, adding, “However, the industry’s unprecedented popularity has also led to unprecedented competition.”</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">According to the press release, these changes are aimed at helping the company focus on its primary goals to “lead in horror, lead in service, and explore the possibilities of location-based entertainment.” To that end, Behaviour says that the restructuring won’t affect its work on <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, which will continue to see regular updates and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/behaviour-interactive-teases-dungeons-dragons-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/">franchise crossovers</a>.</p> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="923" data-injectable="false">At this point it seems almost unnecessary to point out that this is just the latest in a string of layoffs that’s been snaking through the industry since before the start of the year. Companies like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-announces-its-cutting-about-900-jobs-closing-london-studio/">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unity-to-lay-off-25-of-its-workforce/">Unity</a> – to name just a few – have all been hit, and the total number of jobs lost in 2024 alone is already reaching <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/around-9000-video-game-jobs-were-lost-in-2023-estimates-say/">2023’s depressing 9,000</a>. This restructuring from Behaviour may seem like small change in comparison, but every job lost is a life disrupted, and seeing all these losses piled together is staggering.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="sBtk4Z">Cancer is often described in layman’s terms as the body’s cells performing their function, just without any of the biological checks and balances that keep them from interfering with or overtaking one another. I’ve found it a useful metaphor for franchise cinema lately, and what can happen when it goes wrong: A film’s franchise elements metastasize and overtake a movie, trying to reinforce intellectual property at every turn, refusing to let a scene go by without some kind of callback, meta joke, or attempt to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0">make fetch happen</a>. </p>
<p id="g5rTz9"><em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die</em>, the fourth in the series of buddy-cop movies Michael Bay originated in 1995, seems like an unlikely victim of franchise cancer. The pleasure of a Bad Boys movie — as much as that can be discerned from a film series with a decade or more between previous entries — mostly comes from watching its two uniquely gifted comedic leads, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, engaging in antics under the direction of some of cinema’s foremost explosion-lovers. But in <em>Ride or Die</em>, the joys of Smith and Lawrence’s characters getting on each other’s nerves during improbably explosive shootouts is constantly derailed, as the script workshops or retcons every previous element from prior movies into the grand scheme of this one. </p>
<p id="vHvDim"><em>Bad Boys for Life</em>’s Belgian directing duo, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23160356/ms-marvel-directors-interview-avengercon">Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah</a> (<em>Ms. Marvel</em>) return for <em>Ride or Die</em>, which immediately follows the previous film. Detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are still trigger-happy Miami narcotics cops who play by their own rules. But they’ve got more backing these days, from AMMO support-squad members Kelly and Dorn (returning cast members Vanessa Hudgens and Alexander Ludwig), and their immediate boss, Lt. Rita Secada (Paola Núñez). They also get lots of reminders to slow down. Mike, the looser of the two loose cannons, is finally settling down and getting married, while Marcus has a near-death experience that has everyone telling him to diet and chill out. Unfortunately, it just makes him think he’s invincible. </p>

<p id="WOU5eB">This time around, the partners discover a conspiracy to tarnish the reputation of their late captain, Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano), who died in <em>Bad Boys for Life</em>. In their efforts to clear their former boss’s name, the two are framed as co-conspirators and must go on the run. It is perhaps the first, and most aggravating, failing of <em>Ride or Die</em> that nearly an hour of the movie’s 115-minute run time elapses before this — the central premise of the film! — actually happens. The second is all the aforementioned franchise cancer.</p>
<p id="oCLvmE"><em>Ride or Die</em> does not pass up a single opportunity to underline that this is a Bad Boys movie full of Bad Boys things. That conspiracy to frame Capt. Conrad? It’s tied to the case at the center of <em>Bad Boys II</em>. A vital clue for who’s behind it comes from Fletcher (John Salley), who you likely won’t recognize unless you’ve recently seen the first two films. “Bad Boys,” the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd68AthoNIw">1987 Inner Circle hit</a> made famous by the TV show <em>Cops</em> and adopted as the movie franchise’s theme song? You’ll hear no less than three versions of it. What’s more, Mike and Marcus sing it <em>twice</em>, and people constantly call them “the Bad Boys” as if they are the X-Men. </p>
<p id="5ol9ez">All of which makes <em>Ride or Die</em> feel like a less successful version of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/4/3/8325549/fast-and-furious-timeline"><em>Fast Five</em></a>. That film took what was at the time a series of four tonally distinct, loosely connected <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23720463/fast-furious-watch-order-movies-timeline-streaming">Fast &amp; Furious films</a> and willed them into a coherent franchise with some timeline shenanigans and heaps of charisma. The Bad Boys movies, however, do not have as much raw material to fashion into a modern engine of perpetual cinema. They have Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and one very good callback involving Marcus’ son-in-law, Reggie (Dennis Greene). That’s about it. </p>

<p id="gTiBy4">Most of the fault can arguably be laid at the feet of Chris Bremner and Will Beall’s script, which is poorly paced and chock-full of clichés. (It’s kind of hard to keep your composure when Joe Pantoliano, in a pitch-perfect imitation of Princess Leia Organa, leaves the Bad Boys a recorded message calling them “my only hope.”) Smith and Lawrence gamely deliver some pretty terrible jokes, and the supporting cast that returns from <em>Bad Boys for Life</em> is sturdy enough for government work, even while working with such uninspired material. </p>
<p id="QENysQ">El Arbi and Fallah’s direction is the brightest aspect of <em>Ride or Die</em>. The pair has leveled up since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/15/21067187/bad-boys-for-life-review-will-smith-martin-lawrence"><em>Bad Boys for Life</em></a>, showing themselves as eager students of Bayhem, happy to deploy camera work as exciting as the shootouts it captures. Frenetic drone shots zoom through gunfire, cameras pivot over the barrel of a gun, and nothing ever, ever stays still. It’s a bit overwhelming: Restrained compared to Bay in their previous effort, they overreach a bit here. Their action shines brightest when it features someone capable of believably kicking ass on screen, like Jacob Scipio, returning as Mike Lowrey’s long-lost son from <em>Bad Boys for Life</em>.</p>
<p id="ytC4MO">However, the over-the-top shenanigans are all in the service of retrofitting a sprawling franchise over a handful of movies that were never really about strong narrative ties. This is all the more frustrating given the few moments that <em>do</em> get what the Bad Boys movies are about. Like, for example, the third-act shootout where Mike is at his lowest, and it’s on Marcus to motivate him — by shouting the lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd5gFx001qg">Run-DMC’s “Peter Piper”</a> at him. </p>
<p id="1jxBRC">This is the Bad Boys franchise operating as it should. It doesn’t need constant callbacks building out an elaborate mythology. It just needs two charismatic guys dishing out jokes of varying quality. It needs an irresponsible amount of gunfire. And it needs hell-yeah moments like this one, where Martin Lawrence yells that he needs a “big bad wolf in the neighborhood,” and the audience can yell “Not bad meaning BAD, but bad meaning GOOD” right back. </p>
