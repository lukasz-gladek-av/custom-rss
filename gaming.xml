<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 1 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160884/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, Square Enix released an interesting 'stopgap' in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series called <strong>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</strong>. This free-to-play mobile game took the gacha approach to design, regularly launching new units and storylines to interact with as the years rolled by. The company wrapped up that initial version in January this year, but it decided to design a new standalone version for consoles: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
<p>Not quite a straight port of the original nor a brand new game, this fresh release converts a previously more fractured game into a cohesive traditional JRPG that features no online elements or microtransactions and feels more in line with what you’d expect from a proper numbered entry. And while it’s not the true successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">Octopath Traveler II</a>, OT0 nonetheless stands tall as another great entry in the series.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 2 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160892/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The narrative here is arguably the most interesting aspect, as it somewhat bucks the series trend of offering various disconnected narratives following each of the primary protagonists. For one thing, there’s now technically only <em>one</em> protagonist (your self-insert MC) and everyone else is merely an incidental addition to the plot. And while there’s still a nonlinear, chapter-based system that allows you to pursue the main story at your leisure, each chapter is now focused on a specific <em>antagonist</em>.</p>
<p>Even though intraparty interaction is still kept to a minimum, the storyline is nonetheless significantly more streamlined and in line with what you’d expect out of a typical JRPG. You begin as a resident of the cosy, friendly town of Wishvale, which is very quickly pillaged and razed to the ground by a nasty group of villains. After reconnecting with another survivor, you set out on a campaign of vengeance several years later, hunting key leaders of the attack, setting up the first arc of the overarching narrative.</p>
<p>What I really liked about this storytelling approach is how much more personal and interesting it made the rogues' gallery of villains. Not only do the ensuing chapters explore some of the antagonists' moral greyness, but there are some genuinely surprising and <em>dark</em> plot twists that add to the satisfaction when you finally get a chance to punch these people in the mouth.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 3 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160885/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I was always a fan of the way the first two games handled their braided narratives, but choosing to centre the narrative this time on one protagonist and various villains that have made their life hell is an interesting and ultimately worthwhile change.</p>
<p>That all said, the length of the campaign is a <em>long</em> haul. Given that this is based on a live-service gacha that grew quite a bit, there are literally <em>years</em> of storylines to experience—the developers themselves flagged that it should take you <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1963949417548923364">roughly 100 hours to clear</a>, and that’s <em>not</em> including the mountain of optional side content. I wouldn’t say that this tremendous length is necessarily a mark against Octopath Traveler 0, but just be aware that the pacing and quality can vary over that time, as any narrative of that size can get unwieldy in some places.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 4 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160881/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay otherwise follows the standard formula of previous games, wherein you explore a sizeable open world, pick up quests, fight in turn-based battles, explore dungeons, and utilise Path Actions to interact with the various NPCs you come across. Initially, you only have two party members, but as you discover and explore new towns, you eventually grow the party to just over <em>30</em>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, this is exactly how you’d expect a new Octopath entry to play, and while I would have liked to see more innovation on the gameplay side of things, it’s tough to argue that the team didn’t stick the landing with the execution of their gameplay loop.</p>
<p>Combat remains largely the same, with a key difference being that you now have <em>eight</em> active party members instead of four. Only four of them are active during a given round, but when a party member’s turn comes, they can tag out to let their backline partner take an action instead. The backline is more than just a reserve in case someone gets knocked down, too, as all characters in the rear at the end of every round also gain HP and SP.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 5 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160898/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the eight-character setup doesn’t massively change the overall flow of combat that we’re well familiar with by now, I really appreciated the additional strategic depth offered by the extra members. You effectively build BP (Boost Points) twice as fast now, which can lead to some crazy combos if you plan out your team right, and there’s a lot more to think through as you consider the various skills and abilities of each member and plan in advance how you’ll place them in the overall formation.</p>
<p>Do you put two healer characters together to maximise your healing output? Or do you pair one with a DPS character who will need to get cycled to the back to recover? The previous two games regularly asked you similar teambuilding questions, but here that more strategic approach is present to a much higher degree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, individual character progression has been kneecapped a bit, and I'm not as much a fan of how it’s been implemented. The ability to multiclass in previous games kept character-building interesting throughout the whole experience as you constantly unlocked new class types and found new ways to combine different class abilities to lead to some units that truly 'broke' the game. Here, there are no second classes; you can only progress a character along their default assigned class.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 6 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160907/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is some variation introduced by equipping Battle Skills and Support Skills gained from NPCs, granting boons like the ability to utilise wind attacks or increased healing output. However, these feel more limited than giving a character access to all the abilities that come along with a new class, and it leads to characters feeling pigeon-holed into the clear roles they’re designed to fulfil.</p>
<p>There’s something to be said about having a roster of bespoke characters who become simply <em>more</em> of what they already are at the beginning, but I’ve always viewed the Octopath Traveler games as encouraging you to find ways to make party members overpowered by building them far beyond their initial loadouts and here that definitely feels reined in.</p>
<p>Given that there’s technically only the one protagonist in this game, the Path Action system has been adapted. Now your protagonist can do <em>all</em> the actions (such as stealing, inquiring, or haggling) and the success rate is determined by how much you’ve grown their wealth, power, or fame stats by completing various quests and side quests. Which stat gets checked depends on what the character you’re talking to values most, and this also affects what path actions are available to use on them. Overall, this doesn't feel like a significant change, but I appreciated how it gave you reason to regularly return to towns, as many NPCs are clearly way above the levels you’re at when you initially meet them.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 7 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160882/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the headlining new feature is the addition of townbuilding elements while you slowly rebuild Wishvale to its former glory. Simply talking to your carpenter friend, Stia, or interacting with a workbench will turn the overgrown ruins of the once-quaint town into a grid where you can place new buildings, paths, and decorations according to your liking. Some of these buildings have a more functional passive value, too, such as how the pub allows you to bring food and prep dishes to give yourself an edge in battle for a certain number of turns.</p>
<p>As you find new towns, some NPCs will have the 'Invite' Path Action, which lets you invite them to Wishvale to contribute to the community. Every NPC has some sort of passive ability that can affect things like crop production speed or JP (Job Points) gain in battle, and housing them in your town lets you build these up over time. Plus, inviting more residents causes the overall town level to increase, unlocking new structures to build, and lets you place more homes where you’d like.</p>
<p>I appreciated how the townbuilding managed to feel both instrumental <em>and</em> optional to the game’s progression. Though there are plot reasons for why you <em>have</em> to build up the town to a certain point, it’s something that you can otherwise choose to ignore if you’d rather just stay on the road and keep pushing on to the next quest.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 8 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160895/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty to dig into here if you want to get in the weeds of building the most picturesque town possible as you regularly return to reap the rewards. And while there are concrete gameplay benefits from investing in and interacting with your town, they aren’t so enormous that you’re handicapping yourself if you choose to only return to Wishvale when necessary.</p>
<p>As far as visuals are concerned, this entry falls neatly between the fidelity of the previous two mainline games. It's clear that it was built with many reused assets from the first Octopath Traveler, but there are some details and flourishes present that will remind you more of the second game.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version runs quite well, too, and seeing the action unfold at 60fps makes everything appear that much nicer. It definitely feels like a slight step down if you’re playing this right after putting a lot of time into Octopath Traveler 2, but overall the HD-2D art style here still holds up exceptionally well and looks gorgeous in motion.</p>

<p>Much like how the visuals feel like a blend of the previous two games, the soundtrack offers a variety of tracks and remixes from its predecessors, with some new tracks thrown in there to accompany the new content. Though it’s a <em>bit</em> disappointing that we didn’t get a new full-fledged soundtrack for this release, the new music feels right in line with the previous tracks, which are just as excellent as they were when we heard them for the first time.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In many ways, Octopath Traveler 0 feels like a ‘victory lap’ for the beloved series, remixing various elements that you’re familiar with from the past games while introducing some interesting new ones to spice things up a bit. Importantly, this prequel does <em>not</em> feel like a proper Octopath Traveler 3, but that doesn’t mean that it isn't still an incredibly good time and a much better JRPG than most genre peers.</p>
<p>Even if it's a retread in some ways, though, an absolutely monstrous amount of content, interesting new gameplay elements, gorgeous visuals, and compelling storytelling all come together to make Octopath Traveler 0 a must-buy.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Role-playing video games have been around almost as long as D&amp;D itself, but for every step they take towards modernity, many of the fundamentals remain the same. Octopath Traveler 0 is a game that’s more aware of that than any other AAA release this year. It readily leans on RPG fundamentals like turn-based combat, grinding for experience and epic storytelling, while aping the 16-bit visuals of classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI. It’s also a reworking of the mobile title, Champions of the Continent, but, for all of that, Octopath Traveler 0 looks and feels every inch the modern RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSRFT5OVqKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Admittedly, we’ve been here before. The first two Octopath games took eight separate characters, and interlinked their eight narratives to great effect, but it was the HD-2D visuals that instantly won them an avalanche of pixel-art admirers. Octopath 0 immediately pulls the same trick by being undeniably stunning to behold, updating the look of the classics with a shimmering, living filter that brings every scene to life in remarkable fashion. I don’t think I could ever get bored of this art style, and three games in (and with a bunch of other HD-2D games alongside) that looks likely to pan out.</p>


<p>While the visual style remains the same, the overarching structure and narrative framing have changed, this time putting a created character at the centre of everything. Your silent protagonist gets their own name, look, and even a favourite food, but they don’t say much of anything at all, while other characters readily monologue through conversations to their heart’s content. You get used to it, but I did miss the individual characters of the last two games.</p>
<p>That said, the teams at Square Enix and DokiDoki Groove Works have crafted an interesting and companionable bunch of characters to surround yourself with, and there’s a huge number of them, and their backstories, to involve yourself in. Whether touched by tragedy, or seeking knowledge and influence, there’s hundreds of narrative threads to pull on, some of which go nowhere, while others contribute to your own, world-altering quest.</p>


<p>Outside of the thirty recruitable characters, virtually every person you come across can be spoken to, investigated, bartered with, or hired, whether through your persuasive talents or by beating them in combat. It’s an enjoyable, and often productive, diversion, and it makes every town and village feel as though it’s brimming with life and character, even when these backstories are often just a few lines.</p>
<p>The core narrative is split into three strands: Power, Fame and Wealth. At the outset, each of these is headed by a particularly hateful lead antagonist, from the murderous playwright Auguste – who’s definitely stolen the Guardians of the Galaxy’s Collector’s schtick – to the beautiful Herminia whose drug cartel stands to corrupt half the population of the continent. You can tackle these in any order, with the other strands remaining frozen while you work your way through the others.</p>
<p>Your hometown, Wishvale, finds itself decimated at the hands of these evil-doers, setting you and your friends off on a quest to collect the eight divine rings, and you find yourself chasing each of them down, enacting your revenge while also rebuilding your homestead.</p>

<p>Town building is a big part of Octopath 0’s gameplay, and it’s well done, even if you might find it a little limited and straightforward. You can build various homesteads, shops and facilities and gain certain boons by inviting people to live there, while the layout and expansion of Wishvale is up to you, albeit within the framework that you’re given to work with.</p>
<p>You’ll find yourself decorating and tinkering for hours, and getting to see your creation in the beautiful game engine is well worth it. There’s a small fly in the ointment for Switch 2 players, who don’t get to use quite as many objects as PS5 or Xbox Series X|S owners (400 compared to 500), but there’s still enough customisation to truly make this place feel like your own.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 evolves the series’ turn-based combat, though it does feel fundamentally the same as its predecessors. Boosting attacks and breaking enemies is the key to success, wearing down their defences by discovering what weapon types they’re weak to. This time, you can have a massive 8 different characters in your party, with half of those in the back line providing support, while you can also recruit helpers to throw in with you.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that the difficulty level often bounces between ridiculously easy and teeth-gnashingly tough, but it does even out the further you go. If you’re a fan of turn-based combat, Octopath 0’s rendition remains interesting throughout, with the multiple characters bringing some of the mobile-centric chaos and carnage that you’d expect with multiple effects and attacks going on, while failure means you often have to strategise and plan to progress.</p>

<p>If you head into the menus, there’s plenty of the traditional levelling and equipping you’d expect to find, and you can unlock skills in the order you want, which is a nice touch, although you have to bear in mind how much SP they cost to cast when you’re starting out. There’s a huge amount of customisation available, with characters able to learn others’ skills, while your central protagonist can also change jobs – choosing from eight, obviously – learning new skills and improving their stats as they do, and letting you experience some of that variation the previous games had with multiple characters.</p>
<p>One of the biggest worries with Octopath Traveler 0 was whether it was going to feel like a mobile port, and thankfully, it doesn’t. From the huge cast of voice actors, through the multiple quests and asides, to the town-building and exceptional production values, Octopath Traveler 0 feels every bit the full console game. It definitely has a different flavour to the previous titles, and I can see some fans struggling with the shift, but in many ways, it feels fresh and unique when placed alongside its predecessors.</p>

			<p>Although its popularity doesn't reach the heights of other established series like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">Dragon Quest</a>, the Octopath Traveler franchise is proving to be rather seminal for the JRPG genre as a whole, mainly thanks to its HD-2D visual style which has been employed to great success in other titles, including the tactical role-playing game Triangle Strategy, the upcoming action role-playing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-new-trailers-drop-ahead-of-tgs/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, and remakes of classic games such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">first three entries in the Dragon Quest series</a> and in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-ocean-the-second-story-r-far-beyond-the-stars/">Star Ocean: The Second Story R</a>, remake of the second entry in the series created by tri-Ace.</p>



<p>The HD-2D style, which combines 2D sprites with 3D environments bridged together with pixel-art aesthetics, also made its debut a few years back on mobile platforms with Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a free-to-play RPG set in the world of the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-eights-great/">first entry in the series</a>, which also serves as its prequel. This mobile game is also the basis upon which Octopath Traveler 0 has been built to deliver some of its features and story, as well as gameplay that's closer to the first two entries in the franchise.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251122133018_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Octopath Traveler 0 features one of the best stories in the entire series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the first two entries in the series, Octopath Traveler 0 doesn't feature eight different protagonists with their own individual stories, which sort of blend together in the final act, but a single protagonist. This player-created protagonist, whose appearance, Job, and more can be customized before the start of the game, is a resident of Wishvale, a town in the continent of Orsterra which is burned down during the town's annual festival by three nefarious individuals - the witch Hermania, the hero Tytos and the playwright Auguste - in the bid to acquire Aelfric's Ring, an artifact of immense power related to the Flamebringer said to have concluded the war between the twelve other gods and Galdera, saving the world, over one thousand years before the events of the game which fatefully made its way into the hands of the new Ringbearer.</p>



<p>Sometime after the destruction of Wishvale, however, the Firebringer emerges from hiding and together with another survivor of the fire, the apprentice architect Stia, sets out to restore the village, rounding up any other survivor scattered all over Orsterra, setting out to find new people to populate the place and take revenge on the villains that have reduced Wishvale to ash.</p>



<p>Although the Octopath Traveler 0 story moves on two somewhat distinct directions - the Wishvale restoration and the revenge directions - it is a much more focused effort than previous entries in the series, which I felt suffered not only from excessive fragmentation, but also uneven quality between tales -  in the original game more than in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">its sequel</a>. The main quests are still separated in different chapters with different minimum level requirements, so it's not possible to pursue a single questline from beginning to end with no interruption, but this setup is way less forced than in the other games, feeling more natural and organic.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251122140521_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Octopath Traveler 0 villains are among the best seen in modern JRPGs</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The introduction of a single playable character is a huge departure from the rest of the series, but Octopath Traveler 0 handles the challenges of having a silent protagonist with its compelling cast of supporting characters, which include over 30 other travellers that interact with each other in special party chat events, and characters with central roles in the "Master of" quests. Despite a relatively limited screen time, these characters quickly become memorable, as their own motivations for going against the Masters of Wealth, Power, and Fame are clear from the get-go, and their backstories are masterfully woven into the individual villain stories to deliver some gripping tales.</p>



<p>The stars of the show in Octopath Traveler 0, however, are the Masters themselves. Designing the main questlines around them, rather than around the heroes, gave the development team all the time needed to paint a complete picture, and do a great job to highlight how much these people are, simply put, monsters in human form. Their actions at the beginning of the game are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg: they are much worse than they appear. Saying precisely why would be entering into heavy spoilers territory, which I won't do, as the beauty of the Octopath Traveler 0 story is learning the heinous acts these villains are capable of. Suffice to say that it is very difficult to remain unmoved when learning of the physical and mental atrocities these individuals are capable of.</p>



<p>As such, the story is often very dark, and with the villains remaining utterly unapologetic until the end, Octopath Traveler 0 is a breath of fresh air for the genre. True, there are times these villains are slightly made to look like victims of fate as much as other JRPG villains, but their actions say it all: they act the way they do due to the complete disregard of everything that isn't their heinous goals. To make a comparison, one of the villains, the Master of Fame Auguste, reminds me of Final Fantasy VI's Kefka Palazzo, a character that has entered the collective memory of JRPG fans mainly because of his completely unhinged destructive tendencies.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251127192212_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Their heinous, cruel acts make it very easy to hate the Octopath Traveler 0 villains</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The twists and changes to the formula established by the first two entries in the series aren't limited to the story setup in Octopath Traveler 0. Though still very similar to what we have seen so far, the new entry in the series twists gameplay in a competent way that makes the whole package more compelling.</p>



<p>In Octopeth Traveler 0, the player travels all over Orsterra, exploring towns and dungeons as quests dictate, interacting with NPCs via Path Actions to learn more about them, acquire items, hire them for combat, or invite them to Wishvale, and fighting enemies in a classic turn-based combat system enriched by the Break and Boost systems. The first allows players to "break" enemies by hitting their weakpoints with the appropriate weapon or element a number of times determined by their shield value, leaving them stunned and defenseless for an entire turn. The second, on the other hand, allows characters to attack more than once with their equipped weapons or power-up skills dictated by the character's Job by spending the BPs that are naturally accumulated every single turn.</p>



<p>While traversal and exploration continue to be one of the weakest element in the series, as the excellent Path Actions interactions are offset by an uninspired field and dungeon design which basically consists of a series of corridors with nothing of relevance besides the occasional treasure chest, the combat system and character progression have seen some small yet significant improvements that have a significant, positive impact on the entire experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251128180948_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The expanded eight-members party is the biggest gameplay change of Octopath Traveler 0</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With over 30 travelers available, expanding the combat system to include eight characters instead of four was a natural choice. Divided into front and back row, it is possible to switch between pairs at will at the start of a turn, giving access to a bigger selection of attacks and skills each turn, which makes Breaking enemies easier and faster than ever. The bigger party also opens up some effective strategies that improve the pace of combat a lot.</p>



<p>For example, a front row character can spend their BPs to quickly break an enemy, which can then be attacked with everything the back row character has, boosting their abilities using the accumulated BPs and with the full SP granted by the back row automatic restoration mechanics. Some travelers also come with special abilities that can make them switch back to the back row automatically upon use, or that are more effective if used from the back row, opening up a lot of synergies that weren't available in the first two games.</p>



<p>Character progression has also been heavily overhauled to accommodate the much bigger character roster. The series' Job system, which allows players to assign a Job between eight choices - Warrior, Thief, Hunter, Merchant, Apothecary, Cleric, Danger, Scholar - is back in Octopath Traveler 0, but only the Ringbearer can switch between different Jobs after unlocking them. Every other traveler comes with a pre-assigned Job which cannot be changed. Although these Jobs are based on the eight base jobs, they are slightly different variations that either combine skills from two different Jobs, or altogether unique Jobs with unique abilities.</p>



<p>While this, by itself, greatly helps make these characters unique, Octopath Traveler 0 goes the extra mile by offering skill customization options via the Masteries system. By obtaining Mastery items, it is possible to assign up to three Action skills and two Passive skills to any character, which can further differentiate between travelers, even if they belong to the same general Job archetype. This very simple addition, in my opinion, elevates the Octopath Traveler 0 experience significantly, providing a granular upgrade system that is a significant step forward from the basic Job system of the previous entries in the series, allowing players to come up with skill combinations to empower a traveler's set skills and Ultimate Attacks, only partially restrained by the main Job of each traveler.</p>

<p>Besides introducing these changes to combat and character progression, Octopath Traveler 0 introduces some brand new mechanics for the series, with the town-building mechanics that allow players to directly influence the restoration of Wishvale. These town-building mechanics are rather straightforward, allowing players to place a certain number of facilities on the available locations and change their appearance, but they are central to the experience, as getting more facilities up and running, upgrading them and inviting more villagers unlocks essential features, including a monster arena that offers rewards for pitting captured monsters against others, and a Museum where it is possible to listen to collected music scores and display special treasure hidden all over Orsterra.</p>



<p>The town building mechanics are expanded organically throughout the Wishvale restoration-focused quests, and never feel like a distraction. On the contrary, they provide a nice variation from all the adventuring, which doesn't change a whole lot during the course of the adventure, due to the aforementioned average level design.</p>

<p>While Octopath Traveler 0 represents a solid step forward for the series in terms of story and gameplay, the visuals have taken a step back from the second entry in the series. While the HD-2D aesthetics still look gorgeous, locations don't feel as lively as they did in the previous game, and even assets seem to be of lower quality, closer to the original Octopath Traveler. This isn't a major issue per se, but striving for at least the same level of quality as the franchise's current peak would have been a better choice. However, given that the game is based on a mobile platform, this isn't too surprising.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the same hasn't happened to the other core element of the Octopath Traveler series presentation: music. Series composer Yasunori Nishiki delivered another beautiful soundtrack encompassing pieces that evoke emotions from across the spectrum, moving from high-quality sad, evocative pieces to epic combat themes effortlessly. The voice acting is similarly good, with great performances across the board that make the story more involving, and characters more engaging.</p>



<blockquote>
<h2 id="h-review-in-progress-verdict">Review in Progress Verdict</h2>



<p><strong>Time Played:</strong> 30+ Hours</p>



<p>I have completed the main 'Master of' quests, but I have not yet reached the conclusion of the story. Based on the compelling narrative, the excellent eight-character combat overhaul, and the meaningful addition of the Masteries system, the game currently sits as my personal favorite entry in the series. The ultimate score will depend heavily on the payoff of the final narrative act and whether the combat holds up against the toughest challenges.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">$55 billion leveraged buyout</a> which will see Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Jared Kushner become the new owners of EA will reportedly lead to the Saudi Public Investment Fund owning a whopping 93.4 percent of the game publishers. That's assuming the deal goes through as planned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to filings with Brazil’s antitrust regulator reported by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">Wall Street Journal</a> (paywall). The other parties in the takeover, investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, are set to receive stakes amounting to 5.5 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The latter company was founded by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Both Silver Lake and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">Affinity</a> already get some of their own investment funding from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Overall, the Saudi PIF are putting up somewhere in the region of $29 billion to make the deal happen, with $36.4 billion of the $55 billion cost funded in equity, plus the $5.2 billion worth of EA already owned by the country's wealth fund. The remaining $20 billion will come from a loan set to be dished out by JPMorgan Chase Bank, with generative AI <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">reportedly being viewed</a> as a way of repaying the debt by slashing EA's running costs in the coming years. Sigh.</p><p>All of that's a serious chunk of change for a fund recently reported by the New York Times to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-saudi-arabia-fund-behind-the-wildly-leveraged-ea-buyout-is-dealing-with-financial-distress-claims-report">dealing with some "financial distress"</a>. Though, the fund did disagree with that assessment of their money future, casually declaring that they've got $60 billion in cash and "similar financial instruments" in their wallet.</p>
<p>The question, given how much control of Saudi Arabia stand to gain over EA's direction for owning 93.4 percent via the PIF, is whether there's any truth to claims that EA's day-to-day will go on largely as usual, following the deal. "Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged," EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/exciting-news-about-our-future?isLocalized=true#:~:text=Our%20values%20and%20our%20commitment,lead%20the%20future%20of%20entertainment.">said in October</a>.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's ruling regime, led by Mohammed bin Salman, boast a terrible human rights record which <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">Amnesty International</a> cite as including "arbitrary" detention and execution of people simply expressing their opinions, abuse of migrant workers, and discrimination against women. They're also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">believed by the CIA</a> to have been responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. All of that makes the wealth fund gaining majority control of the games publisher worrying, especially given the diversity and inclusiveness studios like BioWare and series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> are noted for.</p>

              <p><span>I wouldn’t fault you for being skeptical if a friend told you about the most amazing role-playing game, and one of the first things said was, “It’s a port of a moderately successful mobile gacha game, but trust me! It’s really great!” But here I am, your friend, telling you that </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> isn’t merely okay, it’s genuinely great. It takes a story previously locked on mobile phones and expands it into a masterfully crafted experience of earnestly told adventure that isn’t simply “good for an RPG” but great by any standard of the word. This is the best the series has ever been.</span></p> <p><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> is the platonic ideal of a role-playing game. Starting with a doomed hometown and a quest for vengeance against colorful villains, it builds to the genre-expected epic battles and world-shattering plots. You’ll leap from story arc to story arc, exploring dungeons and facing off against bosses in turned-based battles; you’ll pause between these big story moments for some comfortable town-building and brisk side quests. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This is not a game that reinvents the wheel and yet I can’t recommend it enough. Using only this simple framework, </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> consistently impresses. It stands side by side with all-time classics and somehow manages to do this in spite of a truly odd development process. </span><b><br> </b><span><br> </span><span>I’ve played much of this game already and knew this story before downloading it because it started as a mobile gacha game called </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent.</span></i><span> Released in 2020, </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> was a very solid RPG prequel to </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i><span> that supplemented development costs, as many mobile games do, with microtransactions and a gacha “pull” mechanic where players could spend in-game currencies on a random smattering of heroes. This was particularly strange because it was a solo game with no real multiplayer component. But the bigger oddity wasn’t the tacked-on money mechanics but the fact that </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> was honestly a good RPG.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Marvelous!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>A Goddamn Role-Playing Game</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Classic stories told with clear passion, crunchy combat and fun team building, some of the best music in all of gaming</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Some party members don't really get a chance to shine, town-building is charming but somewhat limited, there's some stuff from the mobile game I really wish was here.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Square Enix</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>Final save file time was 88 hours and 50 minutes.

The pixel art was great even on mobile, and it had all the production value of a full-priced game. Which raised a question: why the hell was this a gacha game locked away on phones? It was simply way too good to be a mobile game.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Half a decade from the initial launch, Square Enix seems to have reached a similar conclusion, releasing </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> as an updated port for consoles and PC that greatly rebalances combat encounters and adds a fresh, new framing device to the experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In this version of the game, instead of commanding gacha-pull heroes, players create their own character. This adventurer lives in the small hamlet of Wishvale, which is prosperous and safe until a triumvirate of ring-bearing villains plots to burn down the village in search of yet another power-granting ring. A classic setup if ever there was.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This version of the game, which removes all of the mobile version’s paid mechanics, turns out to be the sharpest and most compelling </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i><span> thus far. Packed with some of the finest boss encounters and sweeping storytelling in the franchise, </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> stands up in an oddly sharp rebuke to its progenitor title and answers the question “Did we really need those microtransactions?” with a resounding “no.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>My </b><b><i>Final Fantasy</i></b></h2> <p><span>I can’t say it emphatically enough: I love this game, I think it’s phenomenal. Yet if I’m forced to “ponder the orb” here, I find myself trapped in a fatal loop. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> can’t exist without the mobile gacha game coming before it, and yet the sheer craftsmanship on display, the frankly astounding talent packed into every pixel and each story moment, also screams out to tell me what I already know: So many of the games that we are playing today that try to sneak in ways to slowly bleed us of our cash, could simply be normal video games. We don’t need that gacha shit! You can tear it out and still have one of the best role-playing games of the decade.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Because dear God, what a video game this is. What a wonderful little thing!</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650022"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650022">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As you might expect, combat is the central focus, and </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> makes a few adjustments to the series’ battle system that help it stand out. The most obvious is the increase from an active party of four characters to a total of eight. This might seem like a beefy party size, but there are some benefits to be had.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Shifting away from a focus on character customization (party members only ever have one job instead of a combination of two) gives your fighters distinct roles in combat, while the large roster of characters means you’ll spend much of the game adjusting party compositions to cover potential weaknesses. In battle, four “active” characters stand at the front and can be swapped out with their partner in the back. Battles are a fast-paced affair where you constantly shift out characters to hit enemy weaknesses or else pull in your healers or buffers to bolster your powerhouses. There’s very little downtime in the middle of a battle, and clever teams can cover all your combat needs.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This is draped on top of the usual systems that have come to define an </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> game. Enemies have a variety of weaknesses, and hitting them with the correct weapons or elements chips away their shield until they are stunned for multiple rounds of high-damaging hits. Characters gain Boost Points every turn that can be spent to increase their damage, turbocharge their healing spells, or do things such as extend the duration of debuffs they toss on targets. The ideal boss battle finds a balance between spending just enough of these points to speed up damage to the enemy’s shield while keeping enough in reserve to dump into your attacks when the enemy is stunned. If you’re smart, most fights in the game can be cleared in two breaks of your opponent’s shield. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Managing character health, swapping out your travelers, and figuring out exactly what damage breaks an enemy’s guard gives the first half of a fight a playful tone. You’re poking and prodding and puzzling a path to victory until suddenly it all becomes clear and the stars align for a powerful round of dominating decisions. None of this is particularly complex. There are no timing buttons to parry attacks or pseudo-action systems augmenting the experience.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650021"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650021">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This RPG action is supplemented by more casual intermissions where the goal is to explore the world, meet townspeople, and plan out the newly revived Wishvale. Your hometown, lost in the opening hours like many RPG starting villages before it, lingers heavily in the hearts and imaginations of many characters throughout the game. While most of </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> is focused on dungeoneering and combat, a sizable chunk is also focused on rebuilding your home and wandering the world to find citizens that you can invite to populate the village.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>In the prior </span><i><span>Octopath </span></i><span>games, your party members would have various “path actions” that allowed them to interact with townsfolk in different ways. For instance, Therion the thief could steal items from people, while Olberic the wandering knight could challenge certain characters to duels. This was a good way of gaining access to special equipment without simply spending money in a shop. Certain characters could even be recruited to join you as summonable help in battle. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> retains this but ties path actions to one of three disciplines—Wealth, Fame, or Power—and allows your created hero to do all of them. Depending on how many points you have in the corresponding discipline, your chances of success will increase. Gain enough fame, and recruiting someone becomes easier. With enough wealth, you’ll haggle better</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>There’s nothing stopping players from attempting to perform these actions anyway, which is part of the appeal of exploring any </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> game. Find someone with an incredibly good sword that you only have a three percent chance of stealing? You can still try it. Hell, if you’re stubborn, you might even save-scum until you get it. As a result, although much of the narrative is focused and guided, you still have a lot of incentive to explore beyond the bounds of the current moment, pressing through high-level areas until you arrive at a town where you might find some retired hero with just the right loot. It’s yours if you defeat them in a duel. Does it matter if you’re fifteen levels lower? Maybe if you’re smart, you could set yourself up for a long time.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This aimlessness is a key component of the </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> experience that you can access whenever you need a break. Inquiring about the people in a town might reveal funny stories. You might find a gardener with a crush on a local noble or even someone who once had a party of seven companions like yourself. There’s an entire side of these games that’s about these strange bits of character fluff and the joy of breaking the game by stealing the right dagger far sooner than intended. It’s easy to get lost in the joy of wandering.</span><span><br> </span></p> <h2><b>I’m A Wanderer, I Roam Around</b></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span>, here’s even more reason to wander off and explore towns. Snooping around will lead to recruitable townspeople that you can invite back to Wishvale, and most characters have special benefits that they bring to your town. Someone might be better at working the farm, while recruiting another to work your general store could lower prices on healing items. The town-building in </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> isn’t too complicated but there’s a lot of joy in arranging houses and shops before finding just the right people to handle each new facility is a lot of fun.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Wishvale is where the game’s heart resides. Your character, along with a core group of friends, takes tragedy and from those ashes builds something better. The process of returning from a story chapter to spend a fresh hour or two on Wishvale’s development gives </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>a surprisingly comfortable mood. It’s not </span><i><span>Stardew Valley,</span></i><span> but it’s still a welcome reprieve from the high story stakes. As villains loom on the horizon and the path of heroism seems steeped in blood and pain, there’s always a home to return to and wonderful people to meet.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>That’s the entire “deal” here. This is not a complicated game in terms of themes, but in the face of terrible dark forces and vicious tyrants, </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> ultimately concludes that even the worst times are temporary. Even the most evil of kings can be deposed. All it takes to bring about radical and spectacular change is enough like-minded people. Whether that’s the cast of characters you invite back to Wishvale or the vibrant adventurers that join your actual party.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650020"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650020">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The Power Of Friendship</b></h2> <p><span>When people talk about </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i><span>, the refrain seems to be “It seems cool, but why aren’t these characters talking to each other?” and it’s in those moments where I both agree with the criticism and recall the series’ inspiration. Structured like 1994’s RPG powerhouse </span><i><span>Live a Live</span></i><span>, the mainline </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> games have tried to balance eight separate character stories that players can engage with in any order while still weaving a larger tale that satisfies modern audiences. It’s been a difficult act. </span><i><span>Live a Live</span></i><span> managed it by having a wide range of genres represented in its stories; one chapter was a western, while another could have been a riff on </span><i><span>2001: A Space Odyssey</span></i><span>. Every chapter was wildly different.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Octopath </span></i><span>games, lacking this kind of variety, have tried many ways to satisfy players. The first game tried to weave a subtle connection between plotlines, but a lack of character interaction held it back and made most stories feel contained in their own small bubbles. The sequel adjusted by implementing chapters where the main characters would team up for miniature adventures together as they unravelled the larger plot. It mostly worked out, but still didn’t grab audiences seeking traditional RPG party banter—even if the dialogue writing was great.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> tries something a bit different, and I think it is the series’s most successful story structure yet. Each chapter focuses on dealing with a different villain, pairing the player with a charismatic ally and side pals as they unravel the mystery of one of the divine rings. Many of these stories seem self-contained genre romps—one is a mafia adventure akin to </span><i><span>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure Golden Wind</span></i><span>, another massive midgame stretch turns the game into a </span><i><span>Fire Emblem</span></i><span> tale of warring nations. By the end of the game, a core party of eight “main” characters will have emerged to face the final threat.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Supplementing this are a dabbling of recruitable side-characters to fill out party slots. Only a few of these characters have recruitment quests, while many more simply leap to join your adventure with little prompting. These characters are not really present in the plot but rather rounded out through the optional “party chats” that add fresh ways to banter when you return to Wishvale. In the best moments, these scenes will pop up in dungeons or during overworld travel to give characters a chance to chime in on happenings. This is particularly well-used in the final dungeon, which is packed with party discussions about the journeys they had and the strange sights they faced.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>While playing </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span>, one word continuously rings out: charming. There is not a single cliche or trope that this game doesn’t use— and sometimes it uses them multiple times within the course of a single scene. This is a game written by and for people entranced by melodrama, done with a deep and earnest love for storytelling that allows these archetypal moments to land. A traveling companion reveals themself to be a royal in disguise, or someone leaps into the middle of a climactic battle to tell the villain that they underestimated the power of friendship, and I’m still hooked. It always leaves a smile on my face.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650023" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650023"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650023">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>When Words Leave Off, Music Begins</b></h2> <p><span>The glue holding all of this together is the music. Composer Yasunori Nishiki leaps from style to style with an almost insulting ease. A story arc diving into criminal syndicates and vengeful anarchists becomes defined not only by the blood being spilt but by the brassing saxophone wailing that accompanies it. Once the game’s final villain reveals himself, his powerful marching leitmotif starts to suffocate, his evil seeping subtly into dungeon spaces and story scenes before exploding into what might be the most astounding suite of final battle music I’ve ever experienced.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>All of this music, all of this remarkable beauty, was previously locked away on mobile devices. It is an amazing relief that this music has now been preserved in a more accessible game. No other modern RPGs, not even titans like </span><i><span>Metaphor: ReFantazio</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, are operating quite on this level musically. We should be talking about Nishiki in the same breath as other pioneers of the genre like Yoko Shimomura or Yasunori Mitsuda.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> (and really all turn-based RPGs) functions like a stage musical. Players move through a variety of plots—political dramas, operatic stories about demons, and much more—and wait with anticipation for the moment where two characters reach an impasse, or someone wants something with such deep passion that mere words are not enough. On the stage, this would be the moments where characters burst into song. Here, we are thrust into lavish battle sequences that are equally as musical.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I know that the developers understand this because a key moment in </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 2</span></i><span> turned a singing competition into a turn-based battle. The game transforms into a flat, proscenium view where heroes stand on one side and villains line up on the other, hurling words and special attacks at each other. At key moments, an ally might leap in to give you miraculous buffs. Underneath this, there is music. </span><span><br> </span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650018" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650018"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650018">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2>On The Cutting Room Floor</h2> <p><span>Because this is an adaptation of a long-running live service game, there’s a wealth of content that could have been carried over. Hundreds of recruitable characters, special event quests, side stories, challenge fights and more have been added to </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent </span></i><span>over the last half-decade. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> is in the strange position of having to prune all of that into a tighter package.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a partial remake of&nbsp; </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span>, this game occasionally makes some odd decisions about what to preserve and what to rework. Some changes are quite good. Reworked difficulty and dungeons streamline the gameplay and make this much smoother to progress through. There’s brand new content here including some mysteries that more casual players might never unravel. But there’s also some important things left behind in the original game.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>While there’s still a sizable crew of travelers to choose from—I finished the game with about 35 characters that I could use at my leisure—some more prominent characters from the mobile game aren’t here. Chiefly, the initial group of vaguely “canonical” heroes, such as Viola the Thief or Fiore the Warrior, is missing. These were iconic characters such as they might exist in a mid-tier gacha game, and not having them feels strange.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>Plus, a large amount of character content from </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> simply isn’t here and only a few key travelers have dedicated story content. From character quests to high-pressure coliseum challenges, there are pieces from the original game that aren’t here, resulting in some half-baked party members. Even if they’re still great in a fight.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>My favorite party member was Alexia the Scholar. She’s tossed at players quite early without much of a recruitment process, allowing you quick access to powerful magical spells. Unlike some new characters, she doesn’t have much personal story content and yet her ability to hit bosses with devastating magicks has made her not only my MVP in fights but maybe my favorite scholar in all of the franchise. I wish I knew more </span><i><span>about</span></i><span> her. I like to think maybe I just missed a side-quest but I suspect that’s not really how this all works. Not everyone gets their moment.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>There are also moments where the grandeur is simply too much for the game to handle. Playing on the Nintendo Switch 2, there were key moments where the console struggled to keep up with everything happening on screen. A massive war sequence featuring a redesigned dungeon is dragged down by all those fire particle effects. I loved expanding my town and building out facilities, but as Wishvale grew, I encountered the occasional hitch while running around.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Adapting a game that was made with considerable hardware limitations in mind also means that there are moments where the environmental design and the overall color palette can seem limited compared to, say, 2023’s </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 2</span></i><span>. Some pockets of the game world can feel a bit sparse at first, and the initial dungeon forays are little more than brisk cave adventures.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650019"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650019">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Is Done In Love Is Well Done</h2> <p><span>The scope of </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>changes drastically as time passes, however. That story, whose stakes eventually rise to the very heavens, is told with such fervor that my grin was always wide even if I’ve seen these kinds of stories told countless times before in dozens of games and I can’t count the number of times I stopped mid-battle to simply appreciate the gorgeous sprite work and astounding music. There is something magical here and a surprising challenge during my playtime was peace with how much I had fallen in love with this game. Was that allowed? Was it okay for me to feel so enraptured?</span></p>

 <p><span>Terrence McKenna, American philosopher and lover of magic mushrooms, has a phrase (advice for people experiencing a powerful psychedelic experience) that I’ve been turning over in my head as I walk away from </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span>: “Don’t give into astonishment.” AAA game</span><span>s often try</span><span> to hide their flaws behind mountains of graphical enhancements and production value. Dazzled audiences eat them up regardless of what messages they hold or value they bring simply because they </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> dazzling. The job of a critic is to slow down a little. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Nevertheless, I stand here astonished. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is such a powerful distillation of everything that I find appealing about role-playing games that I cannot put my sentiment aside. There’s the occasional shortcoming, a performance issue here or a feature lost in the adaptation, which I personally miss, but anyone thinking this is some half-assed port of mobile gacha trash would be terribly mistaken. The average player can enjoy anywhere from 80 to 100 hours of gameplay, much of which will be graced by some of the most astonishing storytelling in modern gaming.&nbsp; </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>There is a price for this ride although it’s nothing too terrible. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> simply asks you to leave your cynicism at the door. There is a tendency in modern audiences to try to outsmart games. We’ve seen it all and are often very proud of the fact that there’s nary a plot twist we can’t see coming or a detail we can’t ring the “sin” bell about. Gamers are irony-poisoned, and consumers often compete with art, aiming for a chance to say “I knew that was coming.” Does that make you feel clever? I’ll be over here enjoying the show.</span></p> <p><span>When a piece of media as earnest as </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> comes along—packed with wandering swordsmen, villains ascending to the Heavens, and more—it’s hard not to end up smitten. There is a belief that so long as you tell a story with your head held high and love for your audience, everything else will work out. And the damndest thing about that is that belief is correct. Meet this game with your own child-like sense of earnestness, and you will have an experience that you’ll not forget anytime soon.</span></p>

            <p>Obsidian Entertainment, one of gaming's busiest developers, has announced a delay for this year's remaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update. This was to include a Photo mode and New Game Plus mode, among other things, and it will now be held back - as well as enlarged - for the game's anniversary on 18th February 2026.</p>
<p>"If you've been following our Update Roadmap, you'll know we planned to release an update this fall. To break the bad news first: Avowed will not be receiving a fall update," <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">Obsidian announced on X</a>. "The good news is that we're shifting our efforts toward a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game's release.</p>
<p>"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet. Stay tuned as we head into the new year for more details on what's planned for the Living Lands."</p>

The other two updates this year - one in the spring, one in the summer - brought new abilities, items, NPC behaviours, an arachnophobia-safe mode, and other improvements.</p><p>Avowed was a very pleasant surprise when it arrived at the beginning of the year. A carefree action-adventure which delighted in exaggerated fantasy, it used smaller open-world areas to provide a sandbox exploration experience, and matched them with a tactile and experimental combat system to strong, and very enjoyable, effect. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">I was very complimentary of Avowed in my review</a>.</p>
<p>Avowed wasn't Obsidian's only big RPG released this year, however. The studio also released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds 2 in October, which Alex reviewed and liked</a>, and the studio released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which was a collaboration with Eidos Montreal. That's an early access release so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2 is still finding its little insect legs</a>, but it's a powerful new foundation for the game and franchise to build on for, potentially, years to come.</p>

            <p>
Grotesque and surreal 'farming simulation' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> has been banned from the Epic Games Store on the eve of release, a couple of years after a work-in-progress version of the game was rejected by Valve. In an alleged statement to developers Santa Ragione, the Fortnite makers explain that they've found the game to be in contravention of policies against "Inappropriate Content" and "Hateful or Abusive Content". Given that, according to Santa Ragione, Epic have had access to a build for two months and had already approved the game for publication on their store 18 days before launch, the whole thing feels like a frantic response to Valve's claims about the unfinished build, which Epic presumably haven't seen. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the statement attributed to them, Epic's content reviewers also say that when they piped their findings about Horses through a questionnaire supplied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Age_Rating_Coalition">an international age rating NGO</a>, it told them the game should be rated Adult Only. Horses has already been rated 18 by the Pan-European Game Information system and M for Mature by the Electronic Software Ratings Board, as displayed on the EGS <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Coming Soon page</a>, which is still live as of writing. 
</p>
<p>
AO games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store unless - as the attributed statement reminds us - they've only been rated Adult Only because they have blockchain, NFT or cryptocurrency technology. This is totally fine, because none of those things are reprehensible or controversial, and besides, they probably make more money for Epic than bizarre and disturbing artworks about people dressed as horses.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2iW4SW03F3OfnoXn4E3f4Uf9HXrImI0PqKlr_Syqk8/edit?tab=t.0">According to Santa Ragione</a>, Epic informed the developers that they won't distribute Horses about 24 hours before release, and denied a subsequent appeal 12 hours later. Here's the full reported statement about the ban from Epic, which was sent to RPS over email.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"We are unable to distribute HORSES on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. The 'Inappropriate Content' policy prohibits content which "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated." The 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology)."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The developers say they don't know for sure what pushed Epic to act, but offer a bit of speculation. "Following the announcement of Steam's ban, HORSES became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition," they write. "It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself." Regarding Epic's attributed comments about policy infringement, they write that "no specific indication of problematic content in the game was given, only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines".
</p><p>
If you're catching up with all this, Santa Ragione <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">went public about Valve banning Horses from Steam around a week ago</a>. According to the developers - with partial confirmation from Valve - Steam's reviewers rejected the game after submission of an unfinished build they felt featured "content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor". 
</p>
<p>
While Valve have offered no further details in public, Santa Ragione speculate that this statement refers to a scene of a farm supplier's daughter riding the shoulders of an enslaved naked woman in a horse mask. They have both rebutted Valve's initial suggestion that the game might contain child sexual abuse material, and changed the scene following Valve's review to make the character a twenty-something woman. They note in general that the scene "deals with the societal structure" of the game's world, and that while Horses "does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion." 
</p>
<p>
I've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">reviewed the finished game</a> (at possibly indulgent length - maybe have a toilet break before you dive in) and as regards the final version of that scene, I don't consider this to be any kind of child pornography. I've included screens of it below to give you an idea. To give some broad context, Horses is about violent structural repression and the punishing of sexuality. The "horses" are people deemed to be so immoral they deserve to be treated like livestock. The game is not an endorsement of anything it depicts.
</p>



<p>
As with their response to Valve's rejection of the game, Santa Ragione argue that all of this is just modern-day puritanism in action. "We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of 'decency' were used to silence artists," they write. "Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. These bans passively shape which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship."
</p><p>As with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">payment processor crackdown on "adult" or "NSFW" games</a> from earlier this year, my takeaway is that another large corporate institution is reluctantly pantomiming the role of public guardian. As their on-going support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/oct/24/surge-uk-savings-lost-investment-scams-fake-crypto-fraud">scam-ridden technologies</a> with a considerable <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/Emerging_Digital_Assets_Forrest.pdf">environmental cost</a> suggests, Epic aren't really interested in safeguarding morality - it's just a role thrust on them by their control of distribution. I imagine the key equation here is one of reputation management vs likelihood of a CSAM lawsuit vs opportunity for profit.</p>
<p>

Anyway, we'll mail Epic a request for comment. In the meantime, Horses can still be found on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?srsltid=AfmBOoqFrez0g8LRFGKzFB7RvQFaECoPNhRBncRp9ZNhk8_QHZtZ2HQ9">Humble</a>, <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TheBurntPeanut has been on a monumental glow-up this year. His escapades on games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders have propelled him to superstar status, and during a recent ‘streamer battle’ on the latter title, he secured a concurrent viewer count of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 100,000 people</a>, a number seldom secured by <strong>any </strong>streamer.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, TheBurntPeanut, who literally streams as an animated peanut, slammed Dr Disrespect and his followers after a slew of comments arose about him ‘moving in’ on Dr Disrespect’s territory.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-and-dr-disrespect-beef-explained">TheBurntPeanut and Dr Disrespect Beef Explained</h2>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has, in his words, been ‘making jokes’ about Dr Disrespect since ‘day one’. This all goes back to Dr Disrespect’s immense controversy in 2024, which saw him <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admit to messaging a minor</a> on Twitch years ago, which ultimately led to his permanent ban from the platform.</p>



<p>In the months that have followed, Dr Disrespect, who has since returned to streaming and maintains a solid following, has preached his innocence on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut is at times a scandalous creator who has had to bite his tongue to avoid making ‘cancel-worthy’ statements, but where Dr Disrespect is concerned, it’s <strong>open season </strong>for the vtuber.</p>



<p>The most recent comment from TheBurntPeanut wasn’t at all veiled and was borderline inflammatory:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been making jokes since day one about Dr Disrespect, I think they think since I’m big now I’m encroaching on his territory.</p>



<p>I’m on ARC Raiders not<strong> the playground</strong>, you got nothing to worry about!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full clip:</p>

<p>TheBurntPeanut is up for streamer awards after a year of immense success that has pushed him to the forefront of the industry. He’s incredibly entertaining and has already gained a cult following, which means comments like this <strong>do not </strong>go unwitnessed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Season 01 Battle Pass To Have ‘Improvements’ For The First Time]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-01-battle-pass-improvements/</link>
            <guid>1371274</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 4, Season 01 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone (like the fifth time it has had a ‘Season 01’) will be released worldwide, granting players an all-new Battle Pass to experience across two tiers. As always, there’s the standard Battle Pass and the BlackCell Battle Pass, both of which include dozens of rewards, boosts, and bonuses.</p>



<p>In a recent blog post, the Activision team uncovered fresh changes coming to the Battle Pass system, which have been dubbed the first ‘improvements’ ever to be introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-are-coming-to-the-call-of-duty-battle-pass">What Changes Are Coming to the Call of Duty Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>It was revealed recently in a Call of Duty blog post that when the Season 01 Battle Pass drops on December 4, it’ll land with improvements, the likes of which have <strong>never been seen </strong>before.</p>



<p>Here’s the full spiel from the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-battle-pass-blackcell-bundles#Improvements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock Timing:&nbsp;</strong>The team has taken learnings from&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey. The result: each season’s Battle Pass in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Shorter Initial Pages:&nbsp;</strong>Earlier pages in the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>Battle Pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock HVT content at the end of the page, while later pages in the Battle Pass will contain more rewards. This means players will earn more high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.</li>



<li><strong>Battle Pass Tokens via Daily Challenges:&nbsp;</strong>For the first time, players will have the ability to earn Battle Pass Tokens through completing Daily Challenges, which are now available not only in Multiplayer, Zombies, and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, but also Co-Op Campaign and Endgame (another first!) On certain days in the season, completion of your bonus Daily Challenge will grant you a Battle Pass Token, which can be used right away.</li>
</ul>



<p>This means that the first few pages in the Battle Pass will be shorter and will have a faster completion rate, which means you’ll feel like you’re getting more rewards right off the bat. The further along the Battle Pass you get, the longer the pages will become, which kind of makes perfect sense.</p>



<p>Additionally, for the first time, Battle Pass Tokens will be unlockable via daily challenges that are completable across all game platforms, including the campaign and ‘Endgame’ modes. This will make it easier to get those all-important tokens to grind through the Battle Pass tiers.</p>



<p>The full patch notes for the Season 01 update should be available later today, so stay tuned.</p>

Of course, many stores have been setting up the Christmas cheer for months now (this writer was seeing bedecked trees in shop windows back in October), but, as of today, the Nintendo Museum is finally following suit.</p>
<p>As shared in a post on the museum's official <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1996112175342195124">X</a> account, the lights will be on every night from 4pm JST until close (7pm), and they'll be sticking around in the grounds until the not particularly festive date of 27th April 2026.</p>
<p>While it is far from the kind of display we might expect from Disney Land — or, perhaps more accurately, Super Nintendo World — there's enough Mushroom Kingdom flair here that our nerdy Christmas spirits are sufficiently warmed.</p>
<p>Nintendo has only revealed the two photos of the display at the time of writing (one above and one below), but look! It's cute!</p>

<p>Alongside the lights, the Nintendo Museum has also plonked a Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary plaque next to the warp pipe photo op, which feels like... a very Nintendo way of marking the occasion.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pcjsy3/eidos_montreals_current_state_cancelling_several/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> on Reddit's r/gamingleaksandrumors channel, renowned developer Eidos Montréal appears to have laid off more employees for the third time in less than two years.</p>



<p>The first time was in January 2024, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the new Deus Ex project they had been working on got canceled by parent company Embracer Group. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-new-game-pitched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the project was then shopped around to other publishers, but none picked it up because they felt it was too niche.</p>



<p>At the end of March 2025, Eidos Montréal <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost another 75 employees</a> after its work on Playground's Fable reboot ended. Now, the number of people who just lost their jobs is unclear, but their CVs reveal that the Canadian studio had been working on a now-canceled dark fantasy action roleplaying game focused on melee combat and parkour, based on the revival of an established vampire franchise. Needless to say, this appears to be a fairly obvious reference to Legacy of Kain.</p>



<p>The IP originally created by Silicon Knights and later developed by Crystal Dynamics has been dormant for a long time, following the unsuccessful multiplayer action game, Nosgoth, developed by Psyonix and published by Square Enix. Three years ago, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-confirms-taking-control-of-tomb-raider-legacy-of-kain-and-other-ips-from-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained the rights</a> to Legacy of Kain (as well as Tomb Raider and other IPs) from Square Enix. Shortly after that, Phil Rogers, then CEO of both Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-fans-rejoice-eidos-heard-you-loud-and-clear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major tease to fans</a> that the vampire IP would not be left to waste.</p>



<p>It seems that an attempt was indeed made, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remastered release of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2</a> was likely part of a broader strategy to revive interest in the IP; however, the project was ultimately scrapped. According to the unearthed information, the studio also canceled a 'modern point and click game with turn-based combat', while the status of another project, a 3v3 competitive eSports game taking place in a futuristic setting, is unknown.</p>



<p>Eidos Montréal hasn't released a game of its own since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, which debuted in October 2021. They did, however, co-develop <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grounded 2</a> with Obsidian Games, and apparently, that part of their outsourcing work is still active. </p>



<p>Still, it's a shame they are unable to make a new game in once high-profile franchises like Deus Ex and Legacy of Kain. This inevitably casts a shadow on the storied studio's future.</p>

            <guid>1371259</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warhammer 40,000 setting contains some pretty advanced technology. Blackstone Fortresses can destroy entire solar systems. The Aeonic Orb contains the power of an entire sun. And — get this — the Speranza, a massive vessel the size of a continent, can actually manipulate a black hole and fire it. Ouch!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, the Warhammer 40,000 setting has galaxy crushing might under its belt. But, it seems, the various races of the 41st millennium still don’t know what’s going on <em>inside</em> a black hole. And that’s not just the Imperium of Man letting the side down, either. It seems no-one — not even the incredibly advanced Necrons — have managed to work it out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from one of the latest Warhammer 40,000 novels, Guy Hayley’s Archmagos. It stars the much-loved 10,000 year-old dominus of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Belisarius Cawl, who travels to a Necron tomb world trapped on the event horizon of a black hole. And so, Belisarius Cawl ends up talking about black holes in general, and it’s this bit that surprised me as I was reading the book.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/archmagos-1764702308241.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Archmagos, by Guy Hayley.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Warhammer 40,000 novel Archmagos follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on in the book, Belisarius Cawl ruminates on the big knowledge gap the races of the Warhammer 40,000 universe have when it comes to black holes. During this metaphysical ponder, he speculates that humanity, even during what’s called the Dark Age of Technology (the largely unexplored time period in which humanity was at its technological zenith), had no idea how they work. And, most surprising of all, neither do the Necrons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Necrons, for the uninitiated, are terrifying mechanical warriors who wiped out an entire race of star gods long before the Emperor was even conceived (if he was, indeed, conceived). They’re meant to be the most technologically advanced of all the xenos, and use weapons far beyond our understanding. And so I was somewhat surprised to learn that the physics at play inside a black hole are a mystery to the Necrons, as they are to us in the real world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's what Belisarius Cawl, "the galaxy's pre-eminent mind," as he puts it, has to say about black holes:</p><blockquote>Nobody really knows what these things are, even me. If we were to fall within, would we be destroyed, or would we emerge in some other place? I have never come across a satisfactory answer from any species. I doubt our ancestors at the height of their technology understood them. Some ancient Necrontyr records I... came into posession of by completely legitimate means, say they believe them to be the graves of their mightiest star gods. Maybe that is true. Why not? If a star can birth something with the power of a god, then why wouldn't an astronomical body like this harbor similar secrets?</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There was something grounding about reading this section of the book, something that made the often bizarre and unknowable Warhammer 40,000 universe ever so slightly relatable. The human race today does not know what goes on inside a black hole. I mean, we have theories, but we're largely stumped. A black hole could lead to a new universe. Some think a black hole could lead to a white hole. Personally, I love the black hole leads to a 4D representation of a magical bookshelf idea. The point is we just don't know. And it felt comforting somehow to learn that even 40,000 years in the future, we still haven’t worked it out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A glance online at my usual 40k hideouts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1pbuvii/in_the_grim_darkness_of_the_far_future_you_still/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threw up a debate over this</a>. I know — shock horror! — Warhammer 40,000 fans have something to say about the realism of the sci-fi universe they love so much. Some are pointing out that the C’Tan — those star gods I mentioned earlier — are said to have been able to call black holes into being. So if the Necrons defeated the C'Tan and ripped off their tech, shouldn't they have black holes all figured out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And others are pointing out that the Necrons, as they've been described to us in prior Warhammer 40,000 novels, are able to use black holes pretty effortlessly. "But... we have literally entire cryptek branch of black hole science called Voidmancers, they can just make black hole with wave of a hand... wear them as capes... it's just author who didn't know anything about it," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1pbuvii/comment/nruczou/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared Mastercio</a> before quoting from a book. "So we have entire group of them being able to just channel black holes, but this book just say that they can't... bullshit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Belisarius Cawl is not saying that the races of the 41st millennium are unable to use a black hole or interact with one in various ways, just that they don’t really understand their inner workings — literally what’s going on <em>inside</em> of them.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/gettyimages-1237093074-1764702472748.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">What's inside a Warhammer 40,000 black hole? No-one knows, not even the Necrons. Illustration by Nicholas Forder/Future Publishing via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me onto the next thought: in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, what <em>is </em>going on inside a black hole? Having a bit of fun here, perhaps Warhammer 40,000 black holes have something to do with the warp, the alternate dimension hellscape in which the Chaos gods rile each other up and demons plot to tear into realspace and end all life as we know it. Maybe if you were to actually venture into a Warhammer 40,000 black hole, you’d end up in Grandfather Nurgle’s garden for a spot of (probably very bad for you) tea. Or perhaps you’d find yourself the inadvertent star of a Slaaneshi sex show. The mind boggles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with most things Warhammer 40,000, not knowing the truth of a thing is all part of the fun. Belisarius Cawl's drive-by lecture on the nature of black holes should be considered as reliable as 90% of the lore fans like me fuss over on a daily basis. That is to say, not very reliable at all. And Games Workshop, as is its want, could one day decide to contradict everything Cawl says here and show us that someone somewhere in the Warhammer 40,000 universe knows exactly how black holes work inside and out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Trazyn the Infinite has had a peek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>According to new filings, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is set to own the vast majority of EA if the proposed record-breaking acquisition goes through.</p>
<p>These filings, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">discovered by the Wall Street Journal</a>, have been made to Brazilian antitrust regulators. These filings suggest that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would own 93.4 percent of the video game publisher.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is making this attempt to acquire EA alongside private equity funds Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump.  Silver Lake would own 5.5 percent, while Affinity Partners would own 1.1 percent.</p>

The Public Investment Fund will still need to put up billions of dollars to actually take ownership of EA once it is approved over the next year or so.</p>
<p>CEO of EA Andrew Wilson spoke on the deal, stating: "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games is at a "make-or-break" moment in the studio's history, and needs Mina the Hollower to do well.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a game I have had my eye on since I started at Eurogamer. In fact, I think its announcement was one of the very first articles I wrote for the site. In a first for the company, Mina the Hollower has nothing to do with Shovel Knight. Rather, this time players will have the chance to take on the mantle of adorable but feisty mouse Mina as she sets out to save a cursed island from the perils that have befallen it.</p>
<p>The game features a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world. And, a lot rides on its success when it comes out next year.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As detailed in a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), in the time since Shovel Knight, Yacht Club divided its team in two (with one team set to work on an unannounced 3D version of Shovel Knight which it had "been fantasizing about for years", and one to work on the "less ambitious" Mina the Hollower). Yacht Club also moved into a new office in Los Angeles. However, then the pandemic hit in 2020, and Yacht Club like the rest of us had to adjust to a different way of doing things.</p><p>Work on Mina the Hollower didn't progress as quickly as the studio had hoped, and in 2024, Yacht Club acknowledged that the two-team structure wasn't working, and after laying off some staff and cutting back on other expenses, merged back into one team. The studio's focus was now solely on Mina the Hollower, and work on the Shovel Knight sequel was paused. The project also had a change in leadership, with studio founder Sean Velasco taking over as director from Mina the Hollower's brain child Alec Faulkner, who is said to have clashed with some of his team.</p>
<p>And now, it is "make-or-break for sure," Velasco has admitted. "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," he said of Mina the Hollower. "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great."</p>
<p>However, if the studio only sells around  100,000 copies of Mina the Hollower, "that's not so good". The studio founder did say that if Mina the Hollower were to "flop", then Yacht Club Games would still exist, but it would require some kind of cash injection fast. The studio is already taking steps to keep the studio afloat, and will be moving to fully remote at the end of the year. It will also be shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>"What we're doing in the future is try to figure out ways to have a game come out every couple of years, instead of every five or six," said Nick Wozniak, another Yacht Club founder.</p>
<p>"We haven't released a game in so long."</p>

<p>Mina the Hollower was intended to debut on 31st October, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-developers-zelda-like-game-mina-the-hollower-delayed">was pushed back without a new release date earlier this year</a>. At this time, Yacht Club stated it wasn't "a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p><p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">played the demo for Mina the Hollower on Switch 2 earlier this year</a>, and loved it. "I collected Bonestone, I popped off various goblins and bats, I burrowed my way underneath enemies to spring up excitingly from behind and I negotiated perilous pits, all while bopping along to a gloriously retro-infused soundtrack… Oh yes, I am certainly looking forward to Mina the Hollower's full release," I wrote back in August. This feeling hasn't changed.</p>

                <p>It may come as no surprise that Valve has invested in emulation tech for Arm-based hardware, having just announced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-frame-release-date-price-specs-everything-we-know/1100-6536287/" data-ref-id="1100-6536287">first device running an Arm chip</a>. But beyond its own hardware, Valve's support of open-source emulation projects may have laid the groundwork for playing your favorite PC games on Arm devices like mobiles and tablets--no ports necessary.</p><p>Valve's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-frame-release-date-price-specs-everything-we-know/1100-6536287/" data-ref-id="1100-6536287">Steam Frame</a> headset is the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-steam-frame-will-support-android-games/1100-6536169/" data-ref-id="1100-6536169">first Arm-based device</a>, making use of the open-source FEX emulator to run Windows-native games. As it turns out, Valve has had more of a hand in FEX's development than it initially appeared.

      </div>
<p>"We were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts," Griffais explained. "We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since."</p><p>This is backed up by FEX's Ryan Houdek, who thanked Valve in a recent <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEXiversary/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">anniversary post</a> for "being here from the start" on the seven-year project. "They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases."</p><p>While Valve has only just revealed its first Arm-based device, the company started thinking about developing for Arm as early as 2016. "We knew there was close to a decade of work needed before it would be robust enough people could rely on it for their libraries," Griffais said.</p><p>As an open-source tool, FEX is already being used alongside other Valve-supported tech like Proton to power some of the leading PC emulators for Arm-based mobile devices--meaning Valve is quietly leading the push to bring Windows games to your phone without the need for a port. Whether the company has its own ambitions in the mobile space is yet to be seen, with Griffais saying Valve's current focus remains on "living room, handheld, and desktop."</p><p>Valve's support of emulation comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/" data-ref-id="1100-6536209">hard lessons learned</a> when its original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine </a>flopped, partially due to its limited library. By investing in technology like Proton and FEX, Valve aims to save developers from having to put in time and resources on ports. "We would way rather have those game developers invest their time and energy into making their games better, or working on their next game," Griffais says. "We think that porting work is essentially wasted work when it comes to the value of the library."</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, the development team behind the free-to-play third-person looter shooter game The First Descendant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNh7vwqYdvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared in an official livestream</a> to outline the December update and the roadmap for the first half of next year.</p>



<p>The December update adds the new Descendant Ultimate Yujin, who's revealed through Yujin's Descendant Story. Ultimate Yujin features a hybrid playstyle with two Ultimate Skill Modules: </p>



<ul>
<li>Combat Protocol, which introduces a new combat-focused playstyle that lets him sustain his HP while dealing damage.</li>



<li>Battlefield Medic, which offers a support-oriented style that grows stronger the more he assists his allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Players can also explore the new Forbidden Sanctuary dungeon, an experimental facility in Axion that supports multiplayer co-op and features a challenging new boss. The Forbidden Sanctuary offers key rewards for acquiring Ultimate Yujin.</p>



<p>The December update will also introduce The Grim Reaper, a new Abyss Colossus and a mutated form of Death Stalker, which offers a poison-based challenge that requires The First Descendant players to master its mechanics through careful strategy and timing.</p>



<p>Some Descendants, including Ajax, Freyna, Valby, and Viessa, along with select weapons, will also receive balance adjustments to enhance playstyles and skill performance. Moreover, a new Bunny-exclusive External Component, Sprint Accelerator, will be added, and players will be able to trade Ancestors Modules via the Trade Market.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it comes to next year's roadmap, the developers have decided to delay the debut of Season 4 from early 2026 to Summer so that they can perform an overhaul of the core experience and systems. The goal is to provide players with a clearer loop: set a goal, farm and experiment with builds, and then tackle structured endgame, especially on “Hard” and above difficulties. In the meantime, Season 3 will continue with Episodes 3 and 4. Even Episode 2 will get something in January with the addition of Breach Tracking, a gold‑oriented farming activity where fields and missions are selected at random and can also drop items like superconductive cooling units.</p>



<p>Season 3 Episode 3 will go live in February 2026, introducing the beta version of the new Onslaught Mode to The First Descendant. This is a four‑player endgame mode where parties of four players face waves of increasingly powerful enemies, strategically placing turrets and buffs using resources gained during battle. The full version is planned to go live with the May update.</p>



<p>Episode 3 also introduces regular Descendant Dia with a main story centered on her, while Episode 4 adds one new Ultimate Descendant. Late during Episode 4, the developers will revamp Hard-mode Void Intercept Battles, turning this activity into a multi‑tier endgame pillar; until the new variant arrives, deep‑Void bosses will rotate monthly so older skins, cosmetics, and previously unobtainable deep‑Void Descendant skins can be farmed again.</p>



<p>Farming at Hard difficulty and above will be restructured around an Operation Command/Directive system, where players first choose the item they want to farm and then clear assigned missions for rewards, with the entire high‑level farming experience being rebuilt.</p>



<p>The Arche Tuning/Mutant Cell system is also being redesigned from fragmented A/B/C item drops into selectable nodes, making it easier to understand what benefits a Descendant and where to get it. Moreover, Stat display will be overhauled so final damage and contributions from modules, reactions, tuning, and externals can be viewed and “simulated” in one menu, reducing reliance on the lab for testing.</p>



<p>Finally, the team revealed that Season 4, currently scheduled to hit live servers in Summer 2026, brings Karel's final battle arc plus a large‑scale Mega Dungeon that surpasses current infiltration operations and Void Vessels in scope and spectacle, alongside a complete weapon system overhaul and the introduction of Transcendent‑tier weapons with a more farming‑centric, less grindy progression model.</p>



<p>The First Descendant <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in July 2024</a> and immediately garnered the attention of many players who were looking for an alternative to existing looter shooters, such as Destiny 2 or The Division 2. NEXON soon boasted that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been played by ten million users just in its launch week</a>, although it didn't take long for it to start losing steam, which is why the studio is now trying to overhaul the game's foundation.</p>



<p>On a technical level, the game was pretty advanced. It was the first title to integrate Samsung's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+ Gaming feature</a>, and it was also the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution alongside AMD's FSR Frame Generation on the PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that the former alleges is a "slavish clone" of the Horizon franchise. Now, the two sides have apparently struck a temporary deal ahead of an important court hearing that may determine whether the case goes forward.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, a new filing in court acknowledges that Sony and Tencent have been "engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute." Most notably, Tencent asked for more time to respond to the motion for an injunction, and Sony agreed in exchange for certain concessions. The terms call for Tencent to pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram while also agreeing not to argue in court that Sony delayed its request for emergency relief by granting the extension.</p><p>The filing also notes an agreement between the two sides that Tencent won't ask for expedited discovery in connection with the preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram. It also calls for Tencent to hold the game to its Q4 2027 release window rather than moving it up. Finally, the court document revealed another area where Tencent and Sony see eye-to-eye. The two sides jointly requested that a hearing for Tencent's motion to dismiss and a second hearing held for Sony's injunction request be held on the same day: January 29, 2026.</p><p>At the heart of Sony's case is an accusation that Tencent intentionally tried to confuse players by passing Light of Motiram off as a Horizon-related game. Prior to the legal fireworks, Tencent apparently pitched Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">a Horizon game that was set in Asia</a>, which was ultimately turned down. Once the lawsuit was filed, Tencent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">pulled the Horizon-like imagery</a> from the game's Steam page. In court, Tencent claimed that Sony's lawsuit was an attempt to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-attacks-sony-lawsuit-over-game-accused-of-copying-horizon/1100-6534865/" data-ref-id="1100-6534865">get a monopoly on games similar to Horizon</a>.</p><p>Tencent also argued that it wasn't liable for any damages because any previous discussions about a Horizon game or even the development of Light of Motiram were done by subsidies owned or partially owned by Tencent. In response, Sony accused Tencent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-accuses-tencent-of-playing-a-shell-game-to-avoid-liability-in-horizon-lawsuit/1100-6535487/" data-ref-id="1100-6535487">playing a legal shell game</a> to avoid the repercussions of infringing on its intellectual property.</p><p>As these legal maneuvers played out, Sony and NCSoft announced a new MMORPG called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-steel-frontiers/" data-ref-id="5000-702414">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, which will be coming to mobile platforms and PC. However, it's rumored that Sony is planning its own Horizon MMORPG for PS5.</p>

                <p>Stranger Things returned for Season 5 Vol. 1 last month, and the series is taking one last bow in the '80s before concluding later in December. Usually, the show is pretty sharp about not making major mistakes in the time period or anachronisms that shouldn't be there. But this time, the show made an apparent goof with an old-school Nintendo game.</p><p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/random-did-you-spot-this-nes-related-blunder-in-stranger-things-season-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Hawkins' latest home-grown bully, Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly), was playing the notoriously difficult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghosts-n-goblins/" data-ref-id="5000-9758">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a> on his NES. However, the version of the game playing on the screen was actually the original arcade game that was released by Capcom in 1985.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/myretrolifeshow/status/1994560916118278169" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I love Stranger Things, but Season 5 just committed a cardinal sin.

That said, it's also possible that this isn't a mistake and the arcade version of Ghosts 'n Goblins was used on-screen because it's simply a better looking version of the game.</p><p>To demonstrate, this is what the NES port looks like:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7CdqiHHPpQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P7CdqiHHPpQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Nintendo was a good home console for its era, but it couldn't make the game look as good as it did in the arcade.

<p>Square Enix's new HD-2D RPG starring YOU</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="12de99f7e2a05"><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12de99f7e2a05/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been a busy period for gaming recently, and Square Enix is back this week another role-playing release. Following on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</a> Remake in October, we've now got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which this time puts you in the shoes of your very own custom character.</p>
<p>This game is releasing on the Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December, and ahead of our own review going live later today, the very first critic review has now been shared online. It comes from the famous Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/">Famitsu</a>. So, what did the critics at this outlet think?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gvtroz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>This new entry in the series, which sees you not only becoming the hero but also rebuilding your home, has received <strong>8/9/9/8</strong> from the four Famitsu critics, giving it a total of <strong>34/40</strong>. In the same week, this puts it two points ahead of Famitsu's score for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (sitting on 32/40) and two points <em>behind</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which leads with a score of 36/40.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> games on Switch, the first and second games both received scores of 36/40.</p>
<p>So, that's the first review for the latest Octopath Traveler game! Once again, you can find out more about it (and see our own score) when our review goes live here on Nintendo Life later today. In case you missed it, there is also a demo available for this title on the eShop, and your save data will carry over to the full game.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3b48478afafae"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b48478afafae/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've finally made it, folks! This week marks the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. After years of development, delays, and even a restart, Samus Aran's next 3D outing is officially here for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The critic reviews have also gone live ahead of the big release, and admittedly, the aggregate score has got a lot of people talking online. Prime 4 is currently sitting on 81/100 based on 74 critic reviews. At the time of writing, it's got the same "top critic" score on OpenCritic.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194688 @ 1764758361 -->
<p>This score technically makes Metroid Prime 4 the lowest-rated "mainline" Metroid Prime release on Metacritic. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-remastered">Switch remaster</a> of Retro Studios' first game received an aggregate score of 94/100 when it was released in 2023, and every other "major" entry in the Prime series has received a score of 90 or more.</p>
<p>As harsh as all of this may sound, it's still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">an "excellent" adventure in our books</a>, and we're not alone here – with some sites even awarding it a perfect score. Of course, these scores are focused on the Switch 2 version of the game. As you might have seen, we're currently working on getting our Switch review out the door as soon as possible. So be on the lookout for that!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194682 @ 1764758361 -->
<p>So, with the scores and lengthy wait time for this anticipated release in mind, we want to know if you will still be getting Metroid Prime 4: Beyond this week? Has anything in the lead up to this big release swayed your decision, or will you still be diving in day one? <em>Vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is taking a major step forward as it ages into the back half of the decade <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">with the release of its expansion, War Sails</a>. The action strategy game is finally adding naval combat in this expansion, and ahead of its release, I got to spend some time hearing about it from developer TaleWorlds Entertainment.</p>



<p>I also got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">speak with a couple members of the development team, senior producer Falk Engel and design lead Gökçen Karaağaç</a>, all about this expansion and how it changes Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II, and why TaleWorlds Entertainment is calling this its "<em>biggest expansion ever</em>."</p>



<p>I want to start by saying I'm very new to strategy games. I've previously avoided them because whenever I saw gameplay clips, no matter which specific strategy game it was, it all seemed like it moved too slowly for me. I was also concerned with not being able to really grasp the mechanics, and was overall concerned that I would just not be very good at the game.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I also knew these concerns were holding me back from an entire genre of video games I knew I might seriously enjoy, particularly when it comes to the strategy games that integrate historical elements into their gameplay. Wanting and willing to finally overcome those concerns is what drove me to Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails, and after spending some time with the game, I can confidently say: I was right to be concerned, I am not very good at these games.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I was also wrong to be concerned, because I'm still having a great time. It helps that this feels like a fresh start, not just for me, but for Bannerlord as well. With the release of War Sails, old saves are getting wiped, and it's a fresh new Caladria to explore on land and on sea.</p>



<p>"<em>Mount and Blade has always been about freedom, it's meant to be a blank slate for you to write your own stories</em>," as TaleWorlds Entertainment's Antonio Santo said in the opening to the studio's presentation ahead of release. You can't get more 'blank slate' than new saves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Gameplay_Screenshot_03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels understandable, then, that the cost of this expansion, which is $24.99 USD at regular price (currently $22.49 with its introductory 10% off sale), is half the price of the base game (when the base game isn't on sale like it is right now for half-price, which means with the base game at $24.99 and War Sails at $22.49, you get both for the price of Bannerlord not on sale). </p>



<p>I won't be going into detail about the War Sails storyline, purely to avoid spoilers and also because I'm not through all of it. What I can say is that while it does take a bit to get going since you need to scale your naval capabilities and party size to really get a feel for it, I now can't imagine playing Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord without War Sails and without naval combat. In a lot of ways, it really does feel like a whole new arm of the game has been added, and can now be improved upon.</p>



<p>Which is to say, there's incredible potential here, and while War Sails perhaps doesn't deliver on everything you'd want right away with the addition of naval combat, it sets a strong foundation for what could be next.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Screenshot_01-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For one thing, the sailing is wonderfully intricate and fun to try to master. Mastering maneuverability with your own ship, and especially with a whole fleet of ships, creates an incredible spectacle in naval battles. Even if most of my battles did devolve into smash-and-board skirmishes mostly, the wonderful backdrops and learning how to navigate the conditions, paired with a strong soundtrack, strike at the core of what Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord does best.</p>



<p>And the battles where I employed more strategy than just a head-on assault were all the more rewarding because of how challenging it was to work against the wind and stormy conditions. Large-scale battles are where Mount and Blade is at its best, and that's true for its land battles, and now, naval battles.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Gameplay_Screenshot_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, combat isn't the only area of Mount and Blade that was changed with the addition of naval combat. In his presentation about War Sails, senior producer Falk Engel said, "<em>Even before the full release of the main title, we started receiving many community requests for a naval</em> <em>expansion. By the time we had finished our work on the core game, it was clear that this type of content would be one of the best additions that we could make. Why? Because the addition of the naval dimension allows us to build upon the wide range of gameplay and content, without taking from what people already know and love</em>."</p>



<p>Which is exactly what TaleWorlds Entertainment did, as the naval expansion not only introduced naval combat, but also changes to the game's economy, to trading, to the balance of importance between cities. Coastal cities like Chaikand are now even more important as a hub for trade. You even get a new port area you can walk around that's tuned to each nation.</p>



<p>Speaking of nations, War Sails also brings the Nords back into the equation, an inclusion that design lead Gökçen Karaağaç told me was introduced partly for nostalgia, partly because they were "<em>easy to justify"</em> introducing. "<em>Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here</em>," he said in our interview.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Nords_Screenshot_no_logo_01-2-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Nords, an entire new area to explore, new campaigns, and an entire new frontier of combat are altogether a sizeable addition to Mount and Blade, though they're by no means perfect. Even with TaleWorlds Entertainment putting out several patches since launch, the odd bug feels bound to happen. Thankfully, it's not been anything too severe, like issues with the game crashing on me consistently; it's been more firmly in the funny, sometimes ruinous, freezes and hitches that, as I said, aren't too bad, but are consistent enough that I expect them.</p>



<p>Of course, they hurt far more when you are, as I did, going against the advice Karaağaç provided, which was "<em>do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose</em>." The stakes are already high enough with how much it means to lose a ship, or multiple ships, in a battle, and especially because most engagements, once you've boarded an enemy ship, can result in unwinnable situations if you're not careful with how you move across the deck of your ship. Losing your ship and the battle because of an untimely freeze doesn't feel great, no matter how you slice it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount-Blade-II-Bannerlord-Screenshot-2025.12.03-00.21.08.001.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But bugs can be patched, and at least in this case, they don't ruin the entire experience. War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers. Hopefully, now, it won't be another five years before the next major expansion.</p>

<figure data-uuid="53de7ecbc26e6"><a title="Starsand Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53de7ecbc26e6/starsand-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Seed Lab</em></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese dev Seed Lab has officially announced that its upcoming cosy life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starsand_island">Starsand Island</a>, is getting a Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release when it launches next year.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in the nebulous "early 2026" and coming to all the usual platforms, that list also now includes Nintendo's latest console, where the devs will be offering two modes depending on your preference: Quality Mode, "targeting 45FPS in 1080p", and Performance Mode, delivering "60FPS in 1080p" in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will also support mouse controls and GameChat during online multiplayer. You can check out the reveal trailer below if this one's passed you by thus far.</p>
<p>Now, it has to be said that we're hardly lacking for great <del>roguelike deckbuilders</del> <del>Metroidvanias</del> cosy life sims on Switch, but last year <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsandisland/starsand-island">a successful Kickstarter campaign</a> amassed over $300,000 for this one, so there's clearly an appetite for more chilled vibes and harvesting on a handheld hybrid near you.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo is bringing its island-based slow-life hit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - NS2 Edition</a> to Switch 2 in January, so Starsand might want to avoid that <em>particular</em> part of 'early 2026'. (Then again, is there anyone reading this who doesn't already own New Horizons?)</p>
<p>If you're after an overview and the vibes aren't strong enough on their own, our friends over at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/starsand-island-is-a-cosy-ps5-rpg-straight-out-of-a-studio-ghibli-daydream">recently previewed the game</a>:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193292 @ 1764757537 -->
<blockquote>
<p>"What really sets Starsand Island apart from the likes of, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, for example, is its complex build system.

<p>Following an update for NieR:Automata</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="61e87ca746c94"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61e87ca746c94/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After ongoing requests from players, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nierautomata-finally-lands-switch-2-compatibility-update">got a compatibility update</a> for the Switch 2 in November. With this game now functioning as it should on Nintendo's new hardware, another Square Enix title has now received a compatibility update.</p>
<p>This time it's for the role-playing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a>, which was originally released on the Switch eShop in 2022. While it might not be the <em>best</em> remaster in Square Enix's library, there are still fans out there who have been wanting to experience this title on the Switch 2 without any problems.</p>
<p>The good news is the issues associated with this game on Nintendo's hybrid system have now apparently been resolved. Since the arrival of the Switch 2, there were some start up issues, and while these didn't appear to be a massive problem for a lot of players, there were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1l7dtsz/comment/n0i7402/?share_id=l1E6CBXyyz7XxS7LSjCtZ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">some graphical glitches reported</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing is specifically mentioned on Nintendo's compatibility search page, as of 2nd December 2025, the game is now "supported" and the "game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch" on the Switch 2. The notes attached to this mention how the "previously identified issues have been resolved with an update".</p>
<figure data-uuid="a2baf6b5624a0"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2baf6b5624a0/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a handful of compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. Apart from NieR, several other titles received compatibility updates including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>. If you haven't already played the Radical Dreamers Edition of Chrono Cross, we said it was the "best and most convenient way" to relive this classic, despite its shortcomings in the remaster department.</p>
