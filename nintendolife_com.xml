<p>A post on his Facebook page originally confirmed this, and we've now got a translation (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DP3IAiqkhP-/?img_index=3&amp;igsh=MTRrOTdhMXFkNjRzbw%3D%3D">confirmed by James Mielke via social media</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Last Words</p>
<p>The light of my life is finally fading.</p>
<p>The fact that this message has been posted means that the time has finally come. I am no longer in this world.</p>
<p>(I'm asking a loved one to make this final post.)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>My life has been a series of battles. I kept winning.</p>
<p>I've caused a lot of trouble, too.</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that I followed my beliefs and fought to the end.</p>
<p>I have no regrets.</p>
<p>However, I'm filled with regret that I wasn't able to deliver a new work to all my fans. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That's just how it is.</p>
<p>So, it goes.</p>
<p>Itagaki Tomonobu”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Koei Tecmo's Team Ninja has also issued an official statement <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606">on its social accounts</a>, mentioning how it will continue to "carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of <strong>Team</strong> <strong>NINJA</strong>'s first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. Our deepest condolences for his loss. From everyone at Team NINJA"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various industry veterans have shared their own goodbye messages about Itagaki, including Tekken's <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1978753604375736680">Katasuhiro Haruda</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> creator <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1978773161777766864">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/mortal_kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>'s <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1978830801916633389">Ed Boon</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1978874636046598198">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a>.</p>
<p>As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/team-ninja-founder-and-dead-or-alive-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away">Time Extension</a> note, Itagaki was never shy of sharing his honest opinions. In 2001, he also established a new studio and was gearing up to develop a new game.</p>
<p>Although Itagaki isn't connected to the new project, next week happens to mark the release of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> – a collaborative effort between Team Ninja and Platinum Games, and published by Xbox Game Studios.</p>

<figure data-uuid="125f45ffa1eab"><a title="Pokemon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/125f45ffa1eab/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you missed it, the first season of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> Ranked Battles is already underway. It will run from now until 4th November 2025, and gives trainers who reach 'Rank K' a special reward of <strong>Greninjite</strong>. This item can be used to Mega Evolve Greninja into Mega Greninja, and "can't be obtained through normal gameplay".</p>
<p>The official Pokémon website further explains the three types of rewards for Ranked Battles. You'll get rewards at the end of the battle (regardless of your performance), and promotion rewards are gained when you advance to the next rank (this includes items for training such as Mega Shards). The last type of reward is a seasonal reward, which is based on your ranking at the end of a season.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59gqskpx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
