<p>"The guild authorizes a special collaboration"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Recently, it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> content appearing in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and now Capcom is flipping this crossover around.</p>
<p>The developer will be bringing the hunt to its latest Street Fighter entry, dressing the fighters up with new EX colours, "new gears" and more. This limited-time event will be taking place between <strong>1st September 2025</strong> and <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about what exactly you can expect, and you can see it all in motion in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guild authorizes a special collaboration between Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest installments in both of these iconic franchises!</p>
<p>All players who log in during the event period will get special collab items! The Shop will also be stocked with special EX colors for Blanka, Akuma, Manon, Cammy, and Ken inspired by some wild creatures.</p>
<p>During this event, the Battle Hub will also get a new makeover while we run a special Street Voter event. Finally, the Monster Hunter 20th Anniversary Fighting Pass will return for the collab!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the game's online Battle Hub is also getting a themed makeover, and the 20th Anniversary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_rise_sunbreak">Monster Hunter</a> Fighter Pass will be making a return, so join in on the festivities while you can.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/street-fighter-6s-first-season-3-dlc-character-is-out-now-heres-a-look">recent release of the DLC fighter Sagat</a>, with multiple other characters also on the way as part of the Season 3 update. When we see and hear more about these additional fighters joining the roster, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although there's no word about Monster Hunter Wilds making its way to the Switch 2, Capcom did recently announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> for the platform. It will be arriving on Nintendo's new hardware at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has been celebrating Kirby in all sorts of ways recently and apart from the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> on the Switch 2 this week, it's also restocked its online shops with some new goodies.</p>
<p>This latest one might not be the most exciting, but hey – we're sure some fans out there will appreciate "shopping bag" Kirby. You can get this "exclusive" My Nintendo Store item in the US and Canada for <strong>600 Platinum Points</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about it, along with another look. One other thing to note is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15575?_gl=1*l9scot*_gcl_au*Mzc3MzcxMjUxLjE3NTY0Mjg1MDc.*_ga*MzM2MjI1NS4xNzU2NDI4NTA4*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NTY0Mjg1MDckbzEkZzEkdDE3NTY0MzAxNTAkajU4JGwwJGg5NDQ5MDE5MzI.">shipping fees apply</a>.</p>

<p>The third-party title got a full cartridge release</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b1cb4e9b9f45/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch 2 generation has got off to a solid start, but not everything has been rosy – with Game-Key Cards becoming a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">huge talking point within the community</a>. Many third-party developers are currently shipping their games on these cards, but have also come under fire for not offering <em>proper</em> physical releases.</p>
<p>Of course, outside of Nintendo, there are a handful of teams offering their titles on full game cards, so what's the payoff? While we haven't really had any information about this up until now, CD Projekt Group's latest financial report has shared data about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s digital and physical sales in the Switch 2's launch month.</p>
<p>According to a graphic on the fourth page of this report, approximately <strong>75.4%</strong> of Switch 2 users showed their support for the physical version of this release – containing the entire game on the cartridge. As you can also see, <strong>24.6%</strong> opted to purchase the game digitally in June, with the game also hovering at the top of eShop purchases in its opening month.</p>

<p>One thing CDPR didn't share alongside this chart was the exact sales figures, but according to some sales updates in select regions recently, Cyberpunk 2077 has been in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">best-selling charts in its opening month</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This follows comments by CDPR's Vice President of Business Development Jan Rosner, who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/cyberpunk-2077-dev-tells-studios-do-not-underestimate-the-physical-edition">spoke earlier this year about offering a "complete" physical edition</a> of Cyberpunk 2077 – stating at the time how "Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere".</p>
<p>He further noted how physical releases are "especially important for the Nintendo audience", acknowledging how "the right thing to do" was to have Cyberpunk 2077 "on the cartridge".</p>

<figure><a title="Fitness Boxing 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72c977ba4e490/fitness-boxing-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1961111538648899967">Nintendo has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_2_rhythm_and_exercise">Fitness Boxing 2</a> will be taken off of the eShop later this year.</p>
<p>On <strong>2</strong><strong>3rd November 2025 at 23:59</strong>, it will no longer be possible to buy the Nintendo-published game from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Fitness-Boxing-2-Rhythm-Exercise-1843189.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=FitnessBoxing|NULL|ProductDiscontinuation|m_id_2tBvHJYJ48|1843189">digital storefront</a>. If you already own the game digitally, you'll be able to redownload it.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this has only been confirmed <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1961111538648899967">by Nintendo UK on X</a>, but we imagine other regions will follow suit. No reason has been given for the removal, but fans speculate that it's due to the licenses for some in-game music running out.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/19611115386488">https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/19611115386488</a></p>
<p>This happened with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing">Fitness Boxing</a> game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/fitness-boxing-is-being-removed-from-switch-eshop-later-this-year">back in 2023</a>, but just like that game you can also pick up a physical copy.</p>
<p>Presumably, Fitness Boxing 3 is safe for now, but given that this has happened with the first two games, it wouldn't be surprising if 3 was removed later down the line.</p>
<p><em>Do you have Fitness Boxing 2? Will you be grabbing it off the eShop before it's removed? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>
