<p>Switch Online GameCube controller support also confirmed</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID: Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> was announced for the Switch 2 at the end of last year and will be "coming soon" to Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>It's already been confirmed this version of the game will feature graphics and performance modes, and more details about these modes have now been revealed by the developer Feral Interactive during a chat with fans on Reddit.</p>
<p>Here's what was confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"GRID Legends will have both ‘Graphics’ and ‘Performance’ presets for docked and handheld play (where you can expect 30fps and up to 60fps respectively), as well as dedicated ‘Balanced’ and ‘Battery Saver’ presets exclusively for handheld. So you can choose your preferred mix of frame rate and fidelity.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"As for graphical effects, Switch 2 will retain all the fireworks, tyre smoke, sparks and backfire you’ve come to expect from mobile &amp; other console versions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team also mentioned how this release will support the Nintendo Switch Online variant of the GameCube controller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes - GRID Legends will support the NSO variant of the GameCube controller, offering analog trigger support for acceleration and brake. That’s all been tested and verified here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find out more about GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition for the Switch 2 in the announcement post here on Nintendo Life:</p>

<p>When Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> at the end of last year, it also announced a new Robot Master Design Contest.</p>
<p>This latest competition asked fans to submit a unique design for a Robot Master with a "giant suction arm" and provided an existing template to work off. As it's now past <strong>1st January 2026</strong>, this contest has officially concluded.</p>
<figure data-uuid="734e680b15efd"><a title="Mega Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/734e680b15efd/mega-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Design Model — <em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Capcom has followed this up with an update, thanking fans for their "wonderful" submissions, and mentioning how staff will now review the entries. From there, 20 designs are selected to progress to the next round of voting, and then fans will vote in their "top 6" through the CAPCOM ID system.</p>
<p>This will get underway later this month on <strong>30th January 2026</strong>, and there'll even be a voting participation reward in the form of a special icon.</p>
<p>After the top six are selected, Capcom will pick the best design, and this design will be used in Mega Man: Dual Override. You can see the prizes for the winners below along with an example entry.</p>
