<figure data-uuid="6cf4017f02177"><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon opening movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6cf4017f02177/trails-beyond-the-horizon-opening-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nihon Falcom has reiterated its support for the Nintendo Switch 2 today, and it plans to self-publish more major titles on the newest Nintendo console in the coming years.</p>
<p>That's according to a report from <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/418652">GameBiz</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/trails-developer-nihon-falcom-to-shift-focus-on-increasing-number-of-released-titles-per-year-and-publishing-more-switch-2-ports-six-unannounced-titles-currently-in-development/">Automaton Media</a>), where the creator of the <strong>Ys</strong> and <strong>Trails</strong> series has also teased that its currently working on a brand new Nintendo Switch 2 port of one of their existing titles. What that is, we don't know yet, but we'll likely find out at some point this year.</p>
<p>Sales for the company increased by 3.5% year on year, which works out to around $16.7 million USD, in 2025. Operating profit is up 8.1%, while net profit has increased by 6.0%. These successes include the international launches for titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak_ii">Trails through Daybreak II</a>, the worldwide release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a>, and the Japanese release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a>.</p>
<p>Another big goal for the company is to broaden the company's reach, and while the Switch 2 will certainly help with that, it's also looking to do that with more multiplatform releases and multi-language support — for the latter, both Ys X: Proud Nordics' international release and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</a> will include English, French, German, and Spanish subtitles.</p>
<p>While Falcom has been pretty busy in recent years, much of its focus has been on ports, which it says "had a limited impact on business performance."</p>

<p>Now the company aims to release two new titles per year over the next three years, and it's currently working on six unannounced titles; two of these are new ports (including the Switch 2 one), and three are brand new games, which includes a new <strong>Trails</strong>, a new <strong>Ys</strong>, and a new <strong>Tokyo Xanadu</strong> game.</p>
<p>Yes, 2025 was a particularly big year for the legendary Japanese developer, 2026 doesn't look to be any slower. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> launches just next week (and psst, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">it's pretty darn good on Switch 2</a>), and we have Ys X: Proud Nordics' international release on 20th February.</p>
<p>Then, later in the year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_revelations_in_celceta">Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</a> launches in English, with Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter launching in the Fall. <em>Phew</em>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="491ff96f5f5a9"><a title="Call of Duty Switch 2 Poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/491ff96f5f5a9/call-of-duty-switch-2-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>With rumours of the never-ending <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/call_of_duty_finest_hour">Call of Duty</a> franchise's imminent appearance on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-call-of-dutys-nintendo-release-is-apparently-on-target-for-2026">once again doing the rounds</a> — following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">a 10-year agreement</a> to bring the series to Nintendo platforms as part of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, no less — we've been busy pondering just which of these storied shooters we'd like to see ported onto our new(ish) favourite platform first.</p>
<p>Yes, we know it's not going to work like that, most likely. We can't see them dropping a greatest hits first off, or even going with anything that'd make a bad first technical impression, so perhaps the newer stuff is out of the conversation. Also, this writer is of the opinion we're 100% going to see <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/call_of_duty_warzone">Warzone</a> as an opening gambit.</p>
<p>However! There's still plenty of fun to be had in discussing which one exactly we'd prefer to see arrive first, especially given there's so many diverse and exciting entries in a 22-year-old series that's all about shooting stuff at its core.</p>
<p>For me, it's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/call_of_duty_infinite_warfare">Infinite Warfare</a> all day long, easily my favourite of the lot. I'd also choose <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/call_of_duty_wwii">WWII</a> before any of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_black_ops_ii">Black Ops</a> entries (yep, I said it), and even <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/call_of_duty_advanced_warfare">Advanced Warfare</a> would have been a grand old time had it not been for the Spacey sourness.</p>
<p>Enough about us, though (or me, even), we want to hear which of the following mainline Call of Duty games <em>you</em> would like to see on Switch 2. So take a gander at them long, long list of options below, and give your fave a click. Do it for Roach.</p>
