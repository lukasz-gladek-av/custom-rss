<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> is 40 years old today (in Japan, at least). On <strong>21st February 1986</strong>, Nintendo introduced the world to the fantasy land of Hyrule, complete with legendary princesses, magical triangles, evil pig men, and a little boy in a green nightcap. It was the first time anyone had heard Koji Kondo's iconic title theme — apparently substituted in at the eleventh hour after Nintendo discovered Maurice Ravel's 'Boléro' wasn't up for grabs — or read the words "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this". Without it, many of our favourite games of all time simply would not exist. So yes, we think this is a birthday worth acknowledging.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>We've all heard the stories about Shigeru Miyamoto's inspirations for the game, as he set out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619152426/https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/06/19/415568892/q-a-shigeru-miyamoto-on-the-origins-of-nintendos-famous-characters">replicate the feeling of exploring the woods and caves outside of his childhood home</a> as a boy. And that's exactly what he did.</p>
<p>Nintendo's big player from the year before, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, was all about moving from left to right, something that vaguely resembled the 'quick fix' arcade experience for a new home console generation, the culmination of everything Nintendo had learned to that point.</p>
<p>Zelda was different. Launching with the Famicom Disk System (also 40 today), there was an open world at your disposal, items waiting in every dungeon, and rarely any set instruction to 'go here next". It's easy to overlook just how revolutionary and fresh the format was.</p>
<p>The story, by comparison, was something a little more familiar. Drawing inspiration from classic fairytales and high fantasy worlds established by the likes of Tolkien, Takashi Tezuka's story of good overcoming evil is a timeless one. An elf-like boy embarks on a quest to collect some magic rocks, overthrows a power-hungry prince, rescues the princess and restores peace to the land. We've all heard it before, but you can't knock its simplicity. And hey, did Tolkien ever write anything with a follow-up 'Second Quest' for those who have finished the first one? <em>Oh wait</em>...</p>
<figure data-uuid="1a7a7fd341391"><a title="Zelda NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a7a7fd341391/zelda-nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Remarkably, it still feels good today. We're not going to sit here and say that the original TLoZ packs quite the same open-world magic as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead</a> in 2026, but play any of them after experiencing this first slice of Hyrule, and you'll spot Nintendo's fingerprints everywhere.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's always been pretty easy to get your hands on the original game in the four decades since its launch. Be it through re-released GBA or GameCube packages, Virtual Consoles, Nintendo Switch Online, special edition Game &amp; Watches or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> retro systems, we've never been too far away from a way to dive into The Legend of Zelda, and every format will be someone's first.</p>
<p>And so, as we inflate our big '4' and '0' balloons, hang a banner, and let out a celebratory "HYYYYAAA", we thought we'd throw the reminiscing to you lovely lot. The Legend of Zelda has been playable in so many different forms, but which was your first experience with it?</p>
<p>We've listed each and every platform variant in the poll below, from the Famicom Disk System all the way up to NSO. Let's see where it started for everyone!</p>

What a week, eh?</p>
<p>Clearly not content with just the one surprise announcement this week, Nintendo delivered <em>two</em> almighty news drops to our door. First, we got an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-gets-nintendo-switch-2-upgrade-out-now">out-of-the-blue shadow drop</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (which looks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-xenoblade-chronicles-x-and-mira-are-even-more-magnificent-on-switch-2">really rather lovely</a>), and then there was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a>, which are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-officially-revealed-for-switch">now available to pre-order</a> and will go live after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">Presents showcase</a> next week.</p>
<p>We had plenty of reviews for you, too, as we shared our thoughts on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">8/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_mermaids_curse">Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_bomberman_collection">Super Bomberman Collection</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_entropy_effect_x">BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/blazblue-entropy-effect-x">7/10</a>), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/love-eternal">6/10</a>).</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I've been back on a bit of a Pokémon kick ever since EUIC last weekend, and have been enjoying getting back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Pokémon Emerald</a> during my public transport trips. The GBA games are some of my very favourites, so, as you can imagine, I am rather pumped to pick up FireRed &amp; LeafGreen next week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it's just more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a>. I'm a predictable man of simple tastes, what can I say?</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This is a very easy one for me this week! When I'm sick, I make poor decisions, so last weekend I made the decision to get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-dreamlight-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>. I played the heck out of it back on Xbox during early access and always ummed and aahed about getting it for Switch, considering what I heard about the poor optimisation. On Switch 2, however, it's been running somewhat decently, which only makes me more excited for the upgrade next month. I've already sunk in close to 35hrs since getting it, and there's no stopping me yet. I forgot how much I loved it!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm dogsitting, so I wonder what games she'll want to play. Maybe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wobbledogs">Wobbledogs</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/sims_2_pets">The Sims 2 Pets</a>? If only someone had made a Best Dogs list instead of Best Horses. I'm not horsesitting any time soon.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a>. In preparation for the new one, and figuring out if I really want to buy a Switch 2 just to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a>...</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Senior Video Producer</h2>
<p>Is a windfall of games a thing? Because that's what's happened to me this week. As a result, I frankly don't know what I'm going to be playing. No doubt I'll dabble in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a>, get a bit further in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lorelei_and_the_laser_eyes">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> (which is currently on sale), but I think I'm going to have to plan a bit more before I launch back into my current playthrough of Xenoblade Chronicles X. I've been tactfully putting it off hoping a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition would happen, and happen it so very much did.</p>

<figure data-uuid="46189111e6777"><a title="Virtual Console" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46189111e6777/virtual-console.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has already ruled out the Game Boy Advance titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> coming to the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' service, so how about the possibility of more Game Boy purchases via the eShop, similar to the Virtual Console releases during the 3DS and Wii U generations.</p>
<p>Well, in case you missed it, this release for Pokémon's 30th anniversary, which is taking place next week on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, is a special occasion. In other words, it doesn't necessarily guarantee more standalone purchases from this era (or from other generations of "classic" Nintendo hardware) going forward, as there are seemingly no plans for "Virtual Console types of offerings".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fgnmush&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Although it's not an outright "no", according to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">official FAQ for the upcoming Pokémon releases</a>, the company insists it remains focused on offering its classic titles through the paid Switch Online + Expansion service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>What about other classic games beyond Pokémon titles? Is this the return of standalone Virtual Console types of offerings?</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Nintendo:</strong> "</em><em>We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason behind these particular classic game releases being handled "differently" is because the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">apparently thought it would be "fun"</a> to celebrate 30 years of Pokémon like this. To join in on the fun, you'll be required to pay <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> for each title.</p>
<p>Even if Nintendo's comment here was to rule out the return of "Virtual Console types of offerings", other companies such as Hamster Corporation has recently upped retro support with the announcement of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-is-the-closest-well-get-to-virtual-console-in-2026">Console Archives collection</a>. This new library from Hamster revives select titles from multiple console generations, and some titles are already available on the eShop.</p>
<p>Nintendo's most recent update to the Switch Online service is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/virtual-boy-for-switch-1-and-2-is-it-really-worth-revisting-nintendos-greatest-folly">launch of the Virtual Boy library</a> earlier this week. To access this particular library of games, you'll need to have an active Expansion Pack membership and one of the new accessories (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/can-you-use-labo-vr-goggles-for-virtual-boy-games-on-switch-and-other-nintendo-classics-vb-questions-answered">or try one of the workarounds</a>).</p>

<p>Releasing on Switch next week!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>A week out from Pokémon Day and Pokémon's official 30th anniversary celebrations, Nintendo has officially announced the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> as standalone eShop releases.</p>
<p>The announcement has surprised (and shocked) trainers around the globe in all sorts of ways and if the existing info dump wasn't already enough, the official Pokémon YouTube channel is now sharing additional footage of the returning Game Boy Advance titles.</p>
<p>In this particular video, we're given a side-by-side of the FireRed and LeafGreen opening themes, and how exactly you can expect them to look if you end up purchasing them for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each (or your regional equivalent) on the Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The excitement of the Kanto region, as well as the charming Pokémon you know and love, are just as you remember them with updated graphics in Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version. The Sevii Islands—not present in Pokémon Red or Pokémon Blue—have also been added, greatly expanding the areas you can explore and the scope of your adventure. We hope you enjoy these classic Pokémon adventures on Nintendo Switch too!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These games are returning on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> and Nintendo has even released an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">extensive FAQ</a>, clarifying all sorts of details about the Switch releases. This also rules out a local physical release, although there will be one made available in Japan, but it's a code-in-box release.</p>

<p>We're fast approaching the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> on the Switch 2, and ahead of what might just be one of the most-anticipated games of 2026, Capcom has issued a special notice to the "Resident Evil community" about spoilers and leaks.</p>
<p>In a message on social media, it asks fans to "please" not "post or share any pre-release leaks and spoilers" of the new entry starring the series' icon Leon S. Kennedy and the FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<p>Capcom has also mentioned in the same notice how its legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices if required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Capcom:</strong> "We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible. Our legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience."</p>
