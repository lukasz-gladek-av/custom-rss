<p>Sega Sammy has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/ir_2025_web_all_low_en_.pdf">published its latest business report</a> (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/persona-5-series-sales-october-2025/">Persona Central</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/persona-5-games-wont-stop-selling-series-tops-13-million-sales">Push Square</a>), and the Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million units since its debut in 2016. That's up from 10 million back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/the-persona-5-series-has-shifted-over-10-million-copies-worldwide">December 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Series, you ask? Well, that includes the original PS3/4 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/persona_5_dancing_in_starlight">Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</a>. <strong>Persona 5: The Phantom X</strong>, the mobile game, was not developed by Atlus and is not included.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nZnuGRwfwx0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnZnuGRwfwx0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8f0vgzjxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://p-ch.jp/news/20511/">Atlus JP announced</a> that Persona 5 and Personal 5 Royal had sold over 10 million copies alone, making up the huge bulk of that 13k figure, unsurprisingly.</p>

<p>Talking about the growth in repeat sales (for all of Sega's series), Sega says that "In recent years, games have tended to enjoy longer sales lifecycles, and with the growing share of digital downloads, sales of repeat titles have increased accordingly."</p>
<p>In terms of other Persona games that are available on Switch (or Switch 2), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> now sits at 2.07 million sales, though these figures are based on sales prior to the Switch 2 version's release.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>are</em> getting a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a>, though that doesn't appear to be Nintendo bound at the moment. We'll have to wait and see if we'll get to see it on Switch 2.</p>

<figure data-uuid="47cdbbd114c96"><a title="RE Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47cdbbd114c96/re-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly following its official announcement, the Resident Evil Pro Controller for Switch 2 has become available to pre-order.</p>
<p>So if you're really keen on picking this up, you might want to get moving before it's sold out. Something's telling us, however, that this might not happen, because good <em>lord</em> is it expensive.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available in the UK at an eye-watering <strong>£83.99</strong> via the My Nintendo store, which is even more expensive than the regular Pro Controller at <strong>£74.99</strong>. Over in the US, meanwhile, Best Buy is currently offering pre-orders at <strong>$99.99</strong> – the price for the bog-standard Pro Controller over in the states is <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's an expensive one. Aesthetically, it's not a patch on the classic <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_Controller">Chainsaw Controller</a> from the GameCube days, either, but we can't have everything, can we?</p>
<p>Truth be told, we do like the overall design, but man, that Switch 2 logo in the centre is really doing its best to ruin everything, huh? It's literally obscuring the Resident Evil title, alongside a whole bunch of cool iconography from the overall design.</p>
<p>Still, it's neat that Nintendo is willing to allow a third-party Pro Controller at all, and the fact that it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, of all things, is really cool.</p>
<p>Both the game and the Pro Controller will launch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. A Grace Ashcroft amiibo will follow later in the year during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>
