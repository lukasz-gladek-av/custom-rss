One of which happens to be Nintendo's very own Shigeru Miyamoto, which former Rare designer and director Gregg Mayles revealed <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1995198826211340653">on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Sharing a fax from the legendary game creator and director (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/former-rare-designer-reveals-what-shigeru-miyamoto-thought-of-banjo-kazooies-n64-sequel">Time Extension</a>!), Mayles says "Nice of him that compliment (in my mind anyway)" before explaining just what a fax is — to those youngsters online, of course.</p>
<p>The fax itself is a written notice of approval of the final rom of Banjo-Tooie, the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, with an additional note hand-written by Miyamoto in English which says "splendid game" with a little thumbs up and smiley face.</p><div><figure data-videoid="U-42JOukqJg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytU-42JOukqJg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4af2b0rphzom&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>It's a cute little piece of history, and the timing is pretty perfect too — the game just celebrated its 25th birthday a few weeks ago, and we too (read: this writer) have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-banjo-tooie-is-pure-nightmare-fuel-and-i-wouldnt-have-it-any-other-way">fond memories of the follow-up</a>, which takes a bit of a darker, bigger turn.</p>
<p>Mayles left Rare earlier this year following a number of layoffs at Microsoft and the cancellation of Everwild. Back in October, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/banjo-kazooie-director-marks-departure-from-rare-with-a-poem">developer shared a poem on his final day at the studio</a>.</p>

<p>Is that looking... less tarnished?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We might have to wait a little while longer than expected until we can see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> in its full glory on Switch 2, but the title is still popping up at games expos around the world, giving us plenty of opportunities to see it in action.</p>
<p>The latest slice of hands-on time came from the Milan Games Week 2025, where '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Coreydaflame">Corey Da Flame</a>' captured the over-the-shoulder footage found above (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/nuevo-gameplay-de-elden-ring-en-nintendo-switch-2-muestra-mejoras-en-el-rendimiento/">Nintenderos</a>). It's the same opening section that we have seen played on Switch 2 a couple of times now, and off-screen recording is never the <em>best</em> way to get an idea of things from a performance perspective, but things seem... less tarnished than we were expecting.</p>
<p>Okay, it's no PS5 build, but as far as talk of the Switch 2 version goes, it looks pretty darn fine. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">initial impressions of the game in handheld</a> were rather rough, and while things certainly seemed to be a step in the right direction when getting our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/first-footage-of-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2-appears-online">first look at the game in docked</a>, the latest footage suggests that things are getting better still.</p>
<p>Again, we won't know for sure until the full game comes our way at some point next year — and we don't <em>only</em> have over-the-shoulder footage to go off. At the time of writing, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition is still hanging with a vague '2026' release window after FromSoftware decided to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/elden-ring-delayed-on-switch-2-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">delay</a> the port back in October.</p>
