<p>Hint: it's the same as Japan!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Clear River Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> will launch on Switch in the West on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. That's the same date as Japan!</p>
<p>Developed by City Connection Co. Ltd, the game will receive a physical edition in addition to the usual digital release on Switch, a whopping 27 years after its original release on the PlayStation in 1998.</p>
<p>R-Type Delta will run at 60fps on the Switch and you'll also have the option to swap between the new HD visuals and the original presentation. A newly arranged soundtrack is also available, while players can tinker around with the game's multiple difficulty settings for the optimum experience.</p>
<p>If you want a taster before launch and happen to be attending either GamesCom or PAX West this year, R-Type Delta: HD Boosted will be available to try out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the year 2163, having triumphed over the Bydo Empire, the R9 was recovered and stored within a space fortress orbiting Earth. Humanity breathed a collective sigh of relief, but this was short-lived when in 2164 unidentified objects fell from the sky, followed electronic weapons systems running amok, and culminating in an ‘annihilation unit’ stored alongside the R9 suddenly going berserk, descending to Earth and beginning a wave of destruction. To bring the situation under control, the prototype test unit “R9 Delta” is deployed—marking the beginning of a new battle against the Bydo."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll keep you up to date on any fresh announcements regarding R-Type Delta as soon as we hear more.</p>

<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158003/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>There were occasions in 2024 where I wanted nothing more than for the frequency of TMNT game releases to slow down a little. We got <em>three</em> new video game outings, and while some opted for big swings, I couldn't help but feel that the sewer-dwellers' saturation was becoming too much — it's funny how a hit like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> and a widely popular movie like <strong>Mutant Mayhem</strong> will do that.</p>
<p>So, it was with some trepidation that I went into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, a turn-based reimagining from developer Strange Scaffold that launched on PC earlier this year promising yet another "new" take on the brothers' beat-'em-up formula. It's a promise that I've been stung by too many times in the past, and I expected nothing but the same again. Dear reader, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Tactical Takedown is a fresh take on what a Turtles game <em>can</em> be. The restraints and rigidity of a turn-based board shouldn't match the fluid motion of a beat 'em up, but somehow, here, they do. It's a bite-sized experience that isn't without flaws, but if you've grown tired of the IP's persistent punching in recent years, this is the reinvigorating pizza slice you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157997/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with that big selling point: yes, it's turn-based. Tactical Takedown takes the Turtles' usual combo-focused combat and translates it into the world of strategy. Each hero has six Action Points per turn, which can be used to move around the arena or take on members of the Foot Clan. With them all spent, it's the Enemy Turn, and you'll see whether your strategic planning paid off, or if your Turtle is going to take a beating.</p>
<p>This format isn't especially new, but it <em>is</em> new for the Turtles. The beat-'em-up trappings are still there (giant 'GO' signs still crop up to guide you through the stages, don't worry), but Strange Scaffold has impressively folded them into the turn-based structure to create something that will feel instantly familiar to Turtles fans, even if you've never touched a strategy RPG before.</p>
<p>Take the brothers' four distinct playstyles, for example. It's a fundamental part of any good Turtles game, and it's well-translated to the turn-based arena. Mikey is all about manoeuvrability, Raph jumps straight into the action and deals heavy hits, Donnie attacks from range and has access to techy traps, and Leo chains together KOs to slice up foes with precision. You can purchase new moves and switch up each Turtle's 'loadout' before each level, but on the whole, Tactical Takedown nails the feel of each character without any tweaking needed.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157998/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, such differentiation has meant there's objectively a 'best' character to play as (and let's admit it, it's Donnie), but the four Turtles feel nicely balanced here, with each level highlighting their pros and cons in isolation.</p>
<p>Wait, "isolation"? Yep. Chalk it up to another method of standing apart from the TMNT big hitters that have come before it, if you want, but Tactical Takedown's four-storyline plot means you'll only ever be controlling one Turtle at a time. I had no issues with this off the bat, where it's handy to play each hero individually to get used to their unique moveset, but the bros are best when they're together, so it would have been nice to see how these different playstyles and strategies could intertwine in later stages.</p>
<p>This is particularly true considering how nice the whole thing feels to play. It took me a couple of stages to get my bearings, but I was soon chaining together combos to get in and out of the action like a true ninja, and I can only imagine how satisfying that would feel if I could set the brothers up to bounce off each other. There's no option for touch controls, which I normally like to see in small-scale strategy like this, but the button inputs are simple enough that I didn't find myself longing to wipe my greasy mitts across the screen.</p>

<p>The brothers' separation aside, this is clearly a team that understands its source material. The story itself feels like a classic cartoon plot (Karai and Baxter Stockman are wreaking havoc in the city after Shredder's death, what a shocker!), and the brothers' distinct personalities shine through in the charming writing — Raph's hothead-to-loving-brother arc is particularly well handled.</p>
<p>Visually, it moves things in an interesting direction, too. Perfectly matching the turn-based tone of the gameplay, Tactical Takedown all looks as if it's a tabletop board game. Sections of the city pop up in isolation as you move through the stage (leaving plenty of room for punting enemies off the side of the map), and each character is represented by a miniature standee, which changes its pose based on its last action. Its simplicity feels right at home on Switch, and while the pared-back personality of the Turtles' look might not suit everyone (I, for one, missed a good idle animation), it's nice to see the heroes in a half-shell reimagined in yet another new style.</p>

<p>It's worth flagging that even if these visuals are completely up your street, you don't get to soak them up for all that long. Tactical Takedown is a bite-sized experience (I finished my initial playthrough in around five hours), and while you <em>can</em> head back into the levels with a new loadout or to beat your high score, it's still the same structure with the same difficulty, which is rather easy.</p>
<p>Remix Mode, a new addition for the Switch release, alleviates this somewhat... but only <em>somewhat</em>. This optional extra lets you replay each level at a higher difficulty with more variety in the enemy types. The difficulty bump is a noticeable one — I died once on my initial playthrough, but I was lucky to get through the opening stages unscathed in Remix — and the new enemies bring their own helping of challenges, but it does still feel like the same old level with the same old Turtle. Which, in fairness, it is.</p>
<p>So, replayability isn't the name of the game in Tactical Takedown, and that's okay. I do wish that the main campaign had lasted for a little longer, but I'd always rather be left wanting more than see a gameplay loop outstay its welcome.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The combination of turn-based strategy and beat-'em-up gameplay felt like a bit of a square peg, round hole situation, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown melds the two to deliver one of the freshest takes on TMNT that I've seen in a long time. It's a short-but-sweet experience that might not gel with <em>everyone</em>, but after 35 years of beat 'em ups and brawlers, this showcases the Turtles like you've never seen them before. And come on, that's pretty radical, dude.</p></section>

<p>"It would be a very good business decision"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tekken 8 Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1ca4b8d5119e/tekken-8-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 release schedule is already home to a bunch of ports that never would have been possible on Switch 1, and we can only assume that this will continue for the years to come. One title that's yet to be eyed for the new hybrid is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a>, but that's not to say that the game's director hasn't thought about it.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2">Eurogamer</a>, director Katsuhiro Harada confessed that Bandai Namco's latest fighter on Switch 2 is "an interesting option, and not totally off the table," but it sounds like it would be far from a simple port. "It would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware," Harada continued.</p>
<p>"From a business standpoint, [Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience," the director mapped out, "but the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision".</p>
<p>It's far from any kind of confirmation (Harada even emphasised that there is "nothing to announce" on this front right now), but it's interesting to hear these pros and cons, nonetheless. As for introducing the game to a bigger audience, that can only be a good thing for Tekken 8 at the moment. It's still under some serious heat after its <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/tekken-8-season-2-patch-notes-are-here-insane-buffs-have-fans-asking-if-its-an-april-fools-joke">Season 2 patch</a> resulted in heavy backlash and even boycotts from the fans, and the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/tekken-8-ps5-fans-miffed-by-latest-content-roadmap">latest content roadmap</a> didn't go down much better.</p>
<p>Maybe all that work for a Switch 2 port would be worthwhile, then? We'll just have to wait and see. The good folk over at our sister site, Push Square, gave Tekken 8 a whopping 9/10 in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/tekken-8">review</a>, calling it "the franchise at its bombastic best", so we sure wouldn't mind getting in on that action too...</p>
