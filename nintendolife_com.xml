<p>Three Who'sthis?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Cast your mind back to 2022 and you might remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">Dark Deity</a>, the fantasy turn-based RPG that took more than a little inspiration from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>. Fast forward to the present day and we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a>, the second entry in the series which looks just as tied to the Nintendo touchstone.</p>
<p>This one launched on PC earlier this year, but developer Sword and Axe and publisher Indie.io have announced that it will <em>also</em> be making its way to Switch on <strong>4th September</strong>, and we can't help but feel that it's a good fit.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the Fire Emblem ties are once again strong with this one. Taking place in the fictional, fantasy setting of Verroa, you'll control Gwyn, Riordian and 18 other playable characters on their quest to protect their land from the neighbouring Holy Asverellian Empire.</p>
<p>The action all takes place in a top-down, tactical style, reminiscent of the early Fire Emblem games, with one-on-one turn-based encounters zooming in on the hits in all their pixel art detail. It's a format we've seen many times before, but it doesn't make it any less cool.</p>
<p>This sequel boasts 45 classes for its 20 playable characters, with built-in randomisers and campaign customisers ensuring a decent level of replayability.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's set up and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the Eternal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.</p>
<p>Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irvingâ€™s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war. Your decisions will determine the shape of these alliances and define your army. Coupled with the help of a giant pool of customizations, no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dark Deity 2 is now available to pre-order on the North American <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dark-deity-2-switch/">Switch eShop</a> (it doesn't appear to be live on the European variant at the time of writing) for <strong>$24.99</strong>. There's even a 20% pre-launch discount available for those who want to save a few bucks.</p>
<p>We had a perfectly good time with its predecessor back in 2022, stating in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dark-deity">our review</a> that "Dark Deity delivers a convincing and essentially satisfying facsimile of GBA Fire Emblem, but perhaps fails to stand on its own two feet". Let's hope the sequel moves things in the right direction, eh?</p>

<p>That's one radical highway</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>With the release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> drawing ever closer (that's 25th September, speed freaks), Sega is keeping the old hype train rolling along in the right direction with a brand new remix of some of the tunes featured in the upcoming racer, which, we have to say, looks absolutely cracking.</p>
<p>You can check out the video in full above, and honestly, if you've got any nostalgia or love for Sonic in your bones at all, brace for some unexpected emotions.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEGA released the third OST video for <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds,</em> spotlighting a DJ mix that features six remixed tracks from the game. The OST focuses on music inspired by courses including Apotos, Dragon Road, and Market Street based on <em>Sonic Unleashed</em>, Galactic Parade and Sweet Mountain based on <em>Sonic Colors</em>, and Radical Highway based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em> will release digitally and physically on September 25, 2025 for Switch 1. The Switch 2 version - which will be available as a paid upgrade path from the Switch 1 version - will release this year, too, they've just not put an official date on it. Oh, and physical versions for Switch 2 won't see the light of day until early 2026.</p>
<p>On that note, while there is a little delay for physical Switch 2 fans, as we reported a little while back, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/sonic-racing-crossworlds-on-switch-2-will-feature-the-full-base-game-on-cartridge">the full game will at least be on the cart itself</a>. Hooray!</p>

<p>But it will have "full crossplay"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bcb028bc3af9/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> for the Switch 2, we've had a number of updates from Randy Pitchford and the team at Gearbox Software about what exactly fans can expect.</p>
<p>Following the news last month the game would run at "mostly" 30fps (instead of 60fps) on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware, we've now got another Switch 2-related update. This was spotted in the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNQ5NRRFJZ170AXZSQYQ7">game's official FAQ</a>, which was updated earlier this month.</p>
<p>This version will apparently offer "the same exciting" experience as other platforms "minus the split-screen option". Although this is missing, the same paragraph notes how the Nintendo release will have crossplay support with the other platforms. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full crossplay with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S!"</p>

<p>So, if you were hoping to enjoy some split-screen action on a single Switch 2 device, it seems you may need to instead consider the game on another console platform for this particular option.</p>
<p>It was also confirmed not long ago how the Switch 2 physical release of Borderlands 4 will require a download, so expect a Game-Key Card release. This game launches for this platform on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>He's aware fans haven't even seen gameplay yet</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56c21bd8dc43d/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the many surprises during the Switch 2 reveal in April was the new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, a sequel to the GameCube outing.</p>
<p>It's scheduled to arrive later this year, so what's the latest? Game director Masahiro Sakurai has issued another small update <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1956187495991009776">via social media today</a>, mentioning how he thinks the team should be able to share some information about this game soon.</p>
<p>This small update on this project about Kirby's new game lines up with Sora's 20th anniversary in 2025 â€“ with Sakurai thanking fans for their "continued support" over the years. Here's a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Masahiro Sakurai:</strong> "It doesn't matter to most people, but today, Sora Co., Ltd. is celebrating its 20th anniversary. â€¦That's a long time! Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>"The new game *Kirby Air Rider* hasn't even shown gameplay footage yet, but I think we'll be able to share some information soon. Please wait!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest update on Kirby Air Riders follows the game getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">classification last month</a>. Sakurai also mentioned in July how the title was "shaping up to be something great".</p>
<p>Again, Kirby Air Riders is scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, so hopefully we'll at least get some gameplay footage soon. In the meantime, you can take another look at the announcement cinematic.</p>

<p>Exclusive items are already being resold online</p>

<p>Scalpers are reportedly at it again, and this time they're targeting exclusive merch available at the 2025 PokÃ©mon World Championships.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, there are already eBay listings popping up for the commemorative Pikachu plush, themed TCG playmats, card binders, the <a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1955663752457810413">jukebox</a> and various other items available at the event taking place in Anaheim, California this weekend.</p>
<p>Although there's a "one-per-person" rule in place at the venue, scalpers are still taking advantage of the fact the merch is currently exclusive to this event. Some of the community is already highlighting the scenes at the World Championships, as well as the resellers and online listings.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fwkgrqm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's one post, in particular, that's been called out by the PokÃ©mon community. And below this are some scenes from the PokÃ©mon Center pop-up at the event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Selling 2025 worlds bearwalker and shiny gyarados statue. $1000 on bearwalker and $600 on shiny gyarados statue. Payment up front. Zelle/PP FF/cashapp preferably. Pm me if interested. Thanks"</p>
</blockquote>






<p>It's sad to see this sort of behaviour, as it continues to ruin the hobby for many legitimate PokÃ©mon fans and collectors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this follows a story earlier this week about McDonald's Japan having to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">pull its PokÃ©mon TCG Happy Meal promotion</a> after 24 hours because of similar issues tied to scalping â€“ with one customer supposedly attempting to buy 40 Happy Meals. The fast food giant even issued a formal apology.</p>

<p>If you happen to be heading to the 2025 PokÃ©mon World Championships in Anaheim, California this weekend, you can receive a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">PokÃ©mon Scarlet and Violet</a> distribution.</p>
<p>When you enter the badge pickup zone at the venue, you'll receive a unique code for a Toedscool. It's apparently "based on the Toedscool on this year's key art" for the World Championships (<a href="https://serebii.net/">thanks, Serebii.net</a>). You'll need to redeem this code in-game by <strong>August 29, 2025</strong>. Here's a look:</p>

<p>If we hear anything about an online distribution, we'll let you know. For now, if you want to get your hands on this, you'll need to attend this weekend's event, which takes place between <strong>August 15 - 17, 2025</strong>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:140671 @ 1755257775 -->
<p>Apart from this, the PokÃ©mon World Championships will also be offering trainers a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/tune-in-to-worlds-to-get-luca-ceribellis-farigiraf-and-other-special-gifts">special Farigiarf this weekend</a>. It comes equipped with Psychic Noise, Foul Play, Helping Hand and Trick Room.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5hzvmjo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"Luca Ceribelli reached the top in the Masters Division of last yearâ€™s Video Game World Championships with the help of Farigirafâ€”and now you can have it join your team!...This special Farigiraf comes with the same moves and stats as Lucaâ€™s, so give it a try on your own competitive team!"</p>

<p>To obtain this PokÃ©mon, you'll need to watch the official 2025 Worlds livestream for a password you can then use in the Mystery Gift feature of Scarlet and Violet. The password can only be used one time "per save", and it expires on <strong>August 22, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>You can see the full schedule for the 2025 PokÃ©mon World Championships in our previous post. There's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-a-playable-switch-2-demo-appearing-at-upcoming-events">also a Switch 2 demo</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">PokÃ©mon Legends Z-A</a> at this event. This follows on from a free Switch 2 upgrade for PokÃ©mon Scarlet and Violet in June, which included frame rate improvements and a higher resolution update.</p>
