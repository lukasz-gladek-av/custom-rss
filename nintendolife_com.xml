<p>Regardless, I've had quite the ride thus far with my Switch 2. We're still not that far out from launch, and I expect super-duper exciting things in 2026. Loads of 'em. I can smell it. Oh no, wait, that was just my dog.</p>
<div><p>Now, while I haven't had the opportunity to review <em>all</em> of the biggest and best games released for the console in 2025, the ones I have cast my eye over make for a super solid list - with a few absolute stinkers thrown in for good measure. There's always at least one stinker thrown in for good measure. <strong>*points at dog*</strong></p><p>

With all of this in mind — and having recently revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our cumulative NL staff picks</a> — I thought it might be useful to take a look at my top three Switch 2 games of 2025, in no particular order, selected from <em>just</em> the titles that I personally spent time reviewing. Yeah? Might as well give it a go now I've gone this far, eh. I'll even give it a jaunty title. Let's go!</p></div><div><figure data-videoid="KK3nTYgZ9yY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKK3nTYgZ9yY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6205b9nphwto&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<h2>PJ's Top 3 Games From The 25 Switch 2 Games Wot He Reviewed On Switch 2 In 2025 (In no particular order)</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></h3>
<p>I'm not having any more of this "Musou games are braindead button-mashers" patter out of you, son. I don't care if it's Christmas; that tired old line has been wrong for a while now, and in case you weren't aware, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a> makes this very clear.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days of bland, barren maps populated by one-trick CPU enemies. No more are the tired side quests, lack of challenge, lack of variety, lack of combat strategising...and all that other guff that people <em>say</em> us Musou fans have had to endure over the years. This is a big, bold, and beautiful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> adventure that earns every bit of its "official canon" legitimising from the Big N.</p>

<p>This entry learns lessons and takes stock from what went a little wrong last time out, namely that crucial balance between story and combat. The rectifying of this one crucial aspect would have been enough for me, but with the extra grunt of the Switch 2 we also get an absolute looker that's always a pure joy to sit down and blast through. It's so slick and smooth!</p>
<p>My favourite Musou game thus far? Yep, it knocks that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem</a> effort out of pole position and everything.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867 @ 1767105441 -->
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a></h3>
<p>Boof! I knew that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Ivalice Chronicles</a> was going to be good. Very good, even. I did not, however, expect to be swept away quite as hard as I was.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, you may be surprised to learn, is actually my favourite FF of the lot. It's just exactly everything I want in terms of combat, vibes and story. The trifecta...she complete! Yes, I know some folk have issues with the reframing and reorganising of the War of the Lions content in this latest cut, but I am actually a big fan of what they've done with this new version.</p>

<p>It feels cleaner, and in all honesty, I don't really need any more combat once I'm done with the main story as it was originally. The combat in the War of the Lions, well, it was just more gravy, nothing new. This snazzy new effort also does vitally important stuff like make cameras and controls easier and better to navigate with.</p>
<p>Battlefield views, tagging enemies, smarter CPU strategising all much-improved...this is genuinely making an already fantastic game a notably better one. It knocks the experience from <strong>Very Good Game™</strong> territory into the realms of things that are actually, genuinely, very difficult to find any fault with. And all of this in the palm of your hand on Switch 2. Hold me, mammy.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a></h3>
<p>I know I said this is in no particular order. But I sort of lied. The more I consider it, the more it becomes clear that nothing grabbed me in my pure gamer heart quite as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> did this year. It feels like the purest of pure sort of Nintendo magic that we Nintendo fans are forever pining after. Gies a wee sniff, mate. Go on. I just need one hit on that magic, son. Wheeeeeeee!</p>
<p>What has got me so engrossed in and excited about a semi-automated racer? Well, first of all, it's properly hard to fully master. Kirby's latest has depth for those who like it deep (phrasing), whilst also providing for the button-mashers and the low-attention-span fans. Stick at it, get used to its chaotic way of doing things, and you'll find a finely tuned racing beast purrs beneath the horror of giant neon pick-up icons. Yes, they are very big. I love them.</p>

<p>I've had some real sweaty finales (phrasing) during online matchups in this one, and all it takes is one other pro racer (or a whole bunch of you get lucky) to really awaken the magic. Once you've tasted the sweetness of a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, a victory at what feels like 1000s of kilometres per hour through a cosmic chaos of Masahiro Sakurai's creation, it's very hard not be get fully hooked.</p>
<p>If I manage one thing this year — and really, I'm leaving it seriously late in the day but there's always hope — I'd be quite happy it be turning someone, anyone, on to the delights of Air Riders. It's a game that's easy to look at and nope out of. It's also a game that's easy to pick up, play, and walk away from as something that's just a big colourful mess for kids. But what's here beats out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for me in terms of online fun <em>and</em> competitiveness. It does <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Crossworlds</a> in as well. Kirby just has it exactly where it matters, and in exactly the right manner and style for me this year. So suck on that.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5a6ceee95033b"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5a6ceee95033b/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like other iconic Nintendo series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> has a timeline documenting Samus' space adventures from past to present. Although the newest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is very much its own thing, it is still part of the Prime series as a new chapter.</p>
<p>Outside of the first-person entries, it's now apparently been mentioned by Nintendo how this game fits within the <em>entire</em> history of the Metroid series. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60211">Speaking to Famitsu</a> recently, Nintendo's development team reportedly told the famous Japanese gaming outlet how the latest Switch and Switch 2 outing is set <em>after</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> on the Super Nintendo and <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> on the Game Boy Advance (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/metroid-prime-4-timeline-placement/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceovzimx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>In saying this, it's reiterated how the new entry takes place in "another dimension", meaning there is no need to worry about the timeline or possible impacts on the 2D Metroid series. As a result, players can jump into this new adventure without any prior knowledge and enjoy the original setting. It has been an 18-year wait between this game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Corruption</a>, after all.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review of Metroid Prime 4 here on Nintendo Life</a>, we also mentioned how newcomers would be able to enjoy this new adventure without having to understand the history of the series. If Nintendo, Retro Studios or a prominent Nintendo figure says anything else about how exactly Beyond fits within the Metroid timeline, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>Arc System Works finally delivered the long-awaited Switch update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, in a new development update, it has addressed the future of this particular version of the game. It mentions how the Switch version has required "a great deal of effort and ingenuity" and as a result, the team is currently examining what exact form future updates "beyond Version 2.0" could take.</p>
<p>The feasibility of this is dependent on how far the development team can push itself, and if it's able to overcome technical challenges. Here's the message in full:</p><div><figure data-videoid="myrpG5TN7_Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytmyrpG5TN7_Q" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed53c808vnkroq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>"Regarding the future of GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Developing and operating the game on Nintendo Switch required a great deal of effort and ingenuity to work within hardware constraints.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, we are currently examining what form future updates beyond Version 2.0 could take for the Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Please note that feasibility will depend not only on technical challenges, but also on how far we can push ourselves as a development team, as well as on feedback and support from our players. All of these factors will be taken into account as we make our decisions."</p>

<p>In the title’s latest game update, lines of code such as “via.store.Native.ns2UpgradeEdition” have <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-monster-hunter-wilds-update-gives-hope-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-version/">reportedly been added</a>.</p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be that it’s a reference to a possible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">"Switch 2 version" of the game</a>. Capcom hasn’t said anything about bringing this new entry to Nintendo platforms, but it has already shown strong support for Nintendo’s new hybrid system with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-13CJKg9tJk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7rkzqhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The main concern among fans is tied to the game’s performance. When Wilds launched earlier this year in February, there were issues identified with this aspect of the title as well as the visuals on next-generation console hardware and PC. Capcom has rolled out multiple title updates since then, but hunters are still experiencing problems.</p>
<p>How Wilds would perform on a system such as the Switch 2 remains to be seen, but there have already been some stunning efforts on Nintendo's new device including CDPR's work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Capcom has demonstrated its abilities with Street Fighter 6. Of course, there's no guarantee this discovery in Monster Hunter's latest update will necessarily lead to an announcement.</p>
<p>If you missed the news, Capcom has locked in multiple releases for the Switch 2 in 2026 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">and beyond</a>). Some of these titles include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> in February, the spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> in March, and its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> in April.</p>
