<p>As we all should</p>

<figure data-uuid="e88eb0d8b197c"><a title="Super Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e88eb0d8b197c/super-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've not seen a great deal of Kevin Afghani since the voice actor took over the envious role of Mario from veteran Charles Martinet. But this coming weekend, Afghani will meet his fans for the very first time when he attends <a href="https://www.charliescomiccon.com/">Charlie's ComicCon in Estero, Florida</a>.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Afghani recently caught up with <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/">USA Today</a> to chat about all things Mario, including his prior experience with Nintendo games, how he feels to voice the world's most famous plumber, and what it's like to follow up on the work done by Charles Martinet.</p>
<p>When asked whether he was nervous about stepping into the shoes that Martinet had filled for so long, Afghani confirmed this vehemently, heaping praise upon his predecessor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Look, Charles, as far as I'm concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn't nervous, then I'm the wrong guy.</p>
<p>"I'm the second guy who's doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We expected nothing less, but it's lovely to see Afghani paying his respects to Martinet. The latter is now acting as the official brand ambassador for the Mario series, and frequently attends events himself to meet fans and regale audiences with stories of his career.</p>
<p>Afghani also took the time to debunk an unsubstantiated rumour speculating that he previously took part in Nintendo Direct presentations as a narrator, confirming "I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario".</p>

<p>Sorry, Switch fans</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has announced its first Switch Online game trial of 2026 for North America. It's also apparently the first time a trial has been exclusive to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">EA Sports Madden NFL 26</a>, which launched on the Switch 2 in August last year. This game trial is available between now and <strong>21st January 2026</strong>, and gives players access to the "full" game. If you don't have a subscription, Nintendo is also currently offering a free 7-day online trial in this region.</p>
<figure data-uuid="40373e9090e46"><a title="Madden NFL 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40373e9090e46/madden-nfl-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you do decide to purchase this game, you'll be able to get the digital version for 60% off its regular price until 25th January 2026, reducing it from <strong>$69.99 USD / $89.99 CAD</strong> to <strong>$27.99 USD / $35.99 CAD</strong>. Save data will also carry over to the full game, so you can continue on. There's a chance to earn 100 My Nintendo Points just by playing this Game Trial as well.</p>
<p>You can find out a bit more about this title in our review here on Nintendo Life. We gave it eight out of ten stars, calling it a "very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory".</p>
