<p>How magical</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a>, ININ and Smallthing Studios' prequel to the classic 1993 point and click adventure, is finally and thankfully up and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Simon-the-Sorcerer-Origins-2884080.html">available for pre-order on Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£22.49 / $24.99</strong> for the standard edition or <strong>£31.99 / $34.99</strong> for a digital deluxe version (which nets you a digital art book and soundtrack alongside the game), this surprise prequel was announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/simon-the-sorcerer-origins-reignites-the-classic-point-and-click-series-on-switch-next-year">all the way back in 2023</a>, and had a 2024 window of release initially. But it's finally on the way on <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. Oh, and if you pre-order, you get a free DLC Pony. Contain yourselves.</p>
<p>We're trying our best to ignore the elephant in the room here, but yes, you you read the headline right. Rick Astley. The icon. The phenomenon. The legend. The guy who sang that song about not giving up that one time in the 1980s. We know <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2023/07/simon-the-sorcerer-origins-will-feature-music-from-reads-notes-rick-astley">it's <em>slightly</em> old news</a>, but let us have this.</p>
<p>Alongside Astley's music, who has become an internet sensation over the years thanks to the whole Rick-rolling thing, Simon's original voice actor, the fantabulous Mr. Chris Barrie (everyone's <a href="https://reddwarf.co.uk/">favourite annoying hologram b*****d</a>), is returning<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Now, here are some further deets from the official press release for your delectation!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Over three decades have passed since <em>Simon the Sorcerer</em> first cast his spell on adventure game fans. <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> invites players to step back into his world, this time to discover how it all began. Longtime fans will be thrilled to know that <strong>the original voice actors return in both English (Chris Barrie) and German (Erik Borner)</strong>, adding an extra layer of authenticity and nostalgia to this lovingly crafted hand-drawn origin story.</p>
<p>The magic doesn’t stop at the visuals, as <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> comes alive with a brand-new original soundtrack by acclaimed composer Mason Fischer, perfectly capturing the whimsy, wonder, and emotional depth of Simon’s enchanting world. And as a very special surprise, <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> includes <strong>music icon Rick Astley</strong> in a special role - bringing a touch of 80s soul to the fantasy adventure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as the screens we've seen of this one thus far do look a <em>little tiny bit</em> like a mobile game in nature, it has got the rest of the general vibe pretty much spot-on for Simon's point and click adventures.</p>
<p>Plus, having the original cast and pop royalty along for the ride is giving us hope for something that delivers in its script and soundtrack!</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to some Simon the Sorcerer point and click action later this year? Let us know.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Opinion: Metroid Prime 4 Reminds Me Of Gears 5, And It's Making Me Nervous]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-metroid-prime-4-reminds-me-of-gears-5-and-its-making-me-nervous</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-metroid-prime-4-reminds-me-of-gears-5-and-its-making-me-nervous.1299423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>I’m starting to feel nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Let me explain. During the most recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the long-gestating game finally received a release date for <strong>4th December 2025</strong> on Switch and Switch 2. That’s not all, though; the accompanying trailer also revealed that Samus would now be rocking her very own <strong>Akira</strong>-inspired motorbike called Vi-O-La.</p>
<p>After a handful of environmental shots to set the mood, the trailer showcased a series of close-ups of Samus revving up Vi-O-La before storming off into a vast desert landscape at speeds that would make Captain Falcon break out his best <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/miyagi-PudZiAbQDUEik">Mr. Miyagi nod of approval</a>.</p>

<p>I couldn’t quite gather my thoughts when I watched the trailer for the first time, but after a second viewing, a comparison entered my mind that I’ve not been able to shake ever since: Metroid Prime 4 reminds me of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/gears_5">Gears 5</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I know the two games probably aren’t even remotely comparable on the surface, but Gears 5 actually delivered fans their own sense of whiplash when it delivered its take on the open world back in 2019 (which came, curiously, mere months after development on Metroid Prime 4 was completely restarted under Retro Studios).</p>
<p>Following a fairly linear prologue sequence, Gears 5 revamps the series' structure by offering up a vast open space that can be traversed via a wind-powered vehicle called 'The Skiff'. Essentially, key locations are be scattered throughout the world and you have to hop in your Skiff to make your way from one to the other.</p>

<p>So it wasn't an open world in the sense that, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> is. Yes, you can "go anywhere", as the saying goes, but it was more or less a means of reaching your intended destination, with little in between. These destinations then provide the 'traditional' Gears of War experience that fans are accustomed to. Nevertheless, it gave the game a real sense of scale, far more so than any of the previous entries, and I appreciated it for that.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Gears 5 is <em>not</em> Metroid Prime 4. The latter is the next mainline entry in a series that, in both 2D and 3D, has famously focused on dense, interconnected environments that can be wholly explored on foot (with the odd elevator here and there, of course) – this, along with a similar approach in <strong>Castlevania</strong>, led to the coining of the term 'Metroidvania'. The minor exception here is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3</a> which featured multiple planets, but the sequences in which Samus would travel from one to the other was essentially just an elaborate elevator cutscene.</p>
<p>So while open spaces worked in Gears 5, I'm not sure yet if the same can be said for Metroid Prime 4. It’s still early days of course (yes, even after eight years of waiting), but the short gameplay segment in the recent trailer did enough to convince me that Retro's latest effort is taking more than a few cues from Gears 5. You can see key locations off in the distance, but bar a few pesky enemies, the more immediate surroundings look pretty barren.</p>
<figure><a title="Prime 4 / Gears 5 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e5808101e1fb/prime-4-gears-5-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I really want Metroid Prime 4 to try something new; it’s been eighteen years since the last mainline Prime game, so I’m not going to be satisfied with “more of the same” in this instance. But I also don’t want Metroid to lose what makes it, well… <em>Metroid</em>. What a conundrum. We’ve only got about two-and-a-half months to go until its release, so hopefully Nintendo will share a bit more information in that time and assuage my fears.</p>
<p>At the very least, we know the company is able to pull off some pretty amazing open worlds with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>; my guess is they won't let Retro Studios deliver anything less than spectacular. Here's hoping, anyway.</p>
