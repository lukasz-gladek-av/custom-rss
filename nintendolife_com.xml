<p>Following the original reveal in August last year. it's now been officially confirmed this 2D arcade-style brawler will be arriving digitally for the Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>28th April 2026</strong>. To help celebrate this news, a "release date" trailer for this new game starring the '80s icon has been shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Skeletor uncovers the ancient Dragon Pearl of Destruction, a relic of unspeakable power, he joins forces with Evil-Lyn to plunge all of Eternia into eternal darkness, and only He-Man, Man-At-Arms and Teela can save the planet."</p>
