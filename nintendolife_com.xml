<p>Fans voice their frustrations online</p>

<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03dfc2db8ed2c/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> has finally landed on the Switch 2 this week, and while the experience was expected to match other versions of the game, it seems this isn't <em>entirely</em> the case.</p>
<p>Although community creations are available in the Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-lacks-image-uploading-on-switch-2-and-fans-arent-happy">as highlighted by IGN</a>, this version "lacks image uploading" and it appears to have caught some wrestling enthusiasts by surprise.</p>
<p>The official game FAQ actually goes into a bit more detail about these restrictions, noting how Switch 2 players won't be able to upload or view custom images from "other platforms". The <a href="https://support.wwe2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/42408597808019-WWE-2K-Image-Uploader-Tool">same page on the game website</a> also includes the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 players will not see Image Uploader based Community Creations from any platform or be able to upload their own"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see below, fans and content creators within this space have shared their frustrations online – with some already speculating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1m6lovh/no_community_creations_in_nintendo_switch_2/">about the reasons behind this decision</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51086-wwe-2k25-on-switch-2-blocks-access-to-user-created-content">GoNintendo</a> have also labelled this a "major disappointment" and have reached out to multiple parties to "try and get an answer".</p>

<p>Apart from this, early impressions suggest <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64/status/1948093777320546314">the Switch 2 version of WWE 2K25 is a respectable port</a>. We'll be delivering our Nintendo Life review soon, and if we hear any significant developments tied to this story, we'll let you know.</p></section>

<p>Accompanying the short tribute video of the voice actor's many roles in the Pokémon anime — where Carter played Professor Oak, Gary Oak, Meowth, and Team Rocket's James — along with the below message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of James Carter Cathcart, the voice behind Professor Oak, Gary Oak, James and Meowth of Team Rocket, and other iconic characters for the Pokémon animated series over many years</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In addition to his voice work, James provided over 700 episodes of scripts for the animated series, shaping the stories that defined generations of fans. From the very first episode to the final journeys, James brought warmth, humor, and unforgettable charm to the world of Pokémon. His talent gave life to some of our most beloved characters, and his legacy will continue to reach the hearts of Trainers everywhere.</p>
<p>James’s voice will always be part of our adventure. Our thoughts and condolences are with his family and friends."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carter recorded voice lines for over 700 episodes of the anime, but retired from voice acting in 2023 after being diagnosed with throat cancer.</p>
<p>The video ends on a rather poignant moment from the anime where Meowth and a Glameow are riding a boat while looking at the moon.</p></section>
