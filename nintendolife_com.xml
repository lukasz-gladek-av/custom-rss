<p>Here's a look at the full announcement post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I began thinking seriously about preparing myself to continue drawing for many years to come, I decided to leave Square Enix at the end of last year. Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX.</p>
<p>With the illustration work and supervision related to the 25th anniversary now complete, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment in having fulfilled the role entrusted to me. At the same time, I felt this was the right moment to draw a line under this chapter and take on new challenges.</p>
<p>From here on, I will be working as a freelance illustrator and character designer. While remaining deeply grateful for all the connections I’ve been fortunate to receive through my work so far, I hope to draw upon my experience and continue creating a wide variety of new artwork.</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m still finding my way—listening to advice and learning from senior freelance illustrators—but if you happen to come across my work somewhere, I would be truly happy if you could support me.</p>
<p>To everyone who played the games I worked on at Square Enix, and to all those I had the pleasure of working with over the years, thank you very much. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, and I sincerely hope for your continued support in the future.</p>
<p>May this new year be an exceptionally happy one for all of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Final Fantasy IX is currently available via the Switch eShop. Many had hoped that the 25th Anniversary would include an announcement for the long-rumoured remake, but alas, that has yet to happen.</p>
