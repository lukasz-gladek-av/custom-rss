<p>Believe it or not, <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> is celebrating his 35th anniversary in 2026, and Sega is clearly planning something as it dropped a nostalgia blast of a trailer celebrating the blue blur's life and times.</p>
<p>The trailer highlights the range of Sonic over the franchise's storied history, from his pixel perfect start on the Mega Drive with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, to blockbuster movies in Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy.</p>
<p>He's done everything you can think of — LEGO Sonic, the animated series <strong>Sonic X</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, and obviously tons and tons of his own video games. So 2026 should be a big year for Sega and Sonic.</p>
<p>"For over three decades, Sonic has raced through generations and inspired fans with his unmatched speed, unstoppable energy and fearless spirit" Sega says on the <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog?tab=35th-anniversary">newly-opened 35th anniversary website</a>. "Now, it’s time to honor his incredible journey and celebrate the blue blur’s countless adventures."</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega / Atlus' brand marketing vice president Marcella Churchill shared in a press release that “This milestone is not just a reflection of our past, but also a look toward the future as we continue to innovate and grow."</p>
<p>Sega will be revealing partnerships, collectibles, fan experiences, and more throughout the year. We hope there might be a game announcement in there, too.</p>
<p>21st June 2026 will be the official day of Sonic's 35th anniversary, but we're sure we'll hear a lot about Sega's iconic character over the coming months.</p>
