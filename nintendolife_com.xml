<figure><a title="DK and Pauline" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e041e713289e8/dk-and-pauline.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo hit us with a bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> info in that Direct, and one of the features that we're the most excited to see get the ol' confirmation is two-player co-op!</p>
<p>Oddrock is out and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/say-hello-to-pauline-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline is in</a> (who could have seen that coming?), and you can bring a friend along to play as her. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s co-op options, Bananza will let you sling a remote to somebody else, letting them fire off attacks and pick up collectibles — of which there appear to be <em>hundreds</em> — while you get to all the DK action.</p>
<p>Pauline's vocal blasts can be controlled by the Joy-Con 2's Mouse Mode, to give your aiming some much-needed precision.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, you read that headline correctly. Bananza will support GameShare so you can play with a pal on another system, <em>even</em> if that other system is a Switch 1! Of course, this will only work in Local GameShare (you'll have to both have a Switch 2 if you want to do it online), but it's a cool feature nonetheless. Talk about sharing the love, eh?</p>
<p><em>This is a breaking new story, we'll be updating it with more info shortly...</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

<p>The singing sensation has arrived</p>

<figure><a title="Pauline Donkey Kong Banaza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9f94f6ea8a82/pauline-donkey-kong-banaza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/G2-ck8tU_E8?si=UIzi_TZqAu7jz44f">Nintendo Direct</a> has confirmed the worst-kept secret about the upcoming platformer — Odd Rock, the purple rock that DK carries around with him, isn't a rock, it's Pauline!</p>
<p>In Donkey Kong Bananza, Pauline is a talented singer who wants to reach the Planet's Core to make her dreams come true.</p>
<p>Her singing voice is an important part of the game, and not just the story, as Pauline can use it to unseal certain items, as well as help guide players to their next location. You can also dress her up, too, which is absolutely adorable.</p>

<p>Pauline's appearance in the game was leaked back in April 2025 thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">key art shared on the official Nintendo Korea website</a>. It was taken down soon after, but if you saw it, the surprise was spoiled.</p>

<p>Put your Switch 2 down for a second, folks, because we are mere minutes away from <em>another</em> Nintendo Direct!</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> that's taking the spotlight for this one, with a 15-minute deep dive into the upcoming adventure swinging into action at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 3pm CEST</strong>.</p>
<p>We still don't know exactly what the showcase will hold, but we feel like Nintendo probably has a secret or two up its sleeve. We've seen a fair amount of Bananza from the reveal Direct, Treehouse footage and our own hands-on time with it at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-rock-surfing-and-boulder-bashing-donkey-kong-bananza-is-brilliantly-bonkers">Switch 2 Experience</a>, but this looks like the kind of game that has <em>a lot</em> packed into it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don't have long to wait until the Direct gets underway. The presentation is being streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (and its regional variants), but you can also watch along with us — and have a good old natter about all the surprises — below.</p>
<p>So, get comfy, grab a banana or two, and let's get ready to rock and roll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/hades-2-full-release-is-getting-close-as-development-enters-final-phase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>After over a year in early access, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> is finally gearing up for its full release — which, let's not forget, will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/hades-ii-will-officially-launch-on-switch-2-and-switch-ahead-of-other-consoles">arriving on Switch and Switch 2 ahead of other consoles</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a precise release date for the hotly-anticipated sequel, we should point out, though with the release of the latest early access update, Supergiant Games has teased that it is "getting close" to ver. 1.0 (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-fresh-early-access-update-as-development-finally-approaches-full-release">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>"After more than a year of Early Access development, we're now starting to prepare for our v1.0 launch," the team wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post</a> on Steam. Supergiant says it is "heading into the final phase of Hades II development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches", and it will be sharing more info on the full release "as soon as we can".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As the post suggested there, the new 'Unseen Update' expands the game's core combat, Guardian encounters and character relationships, and gears things up for the introduction of the game's "true ending" — which the dev plans to add before the ver. 1.0 release, fortunately.</p>
<p>All this means that Supergiant is now officially winding down its early access phase. "Our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet," the blog post continues, "and — most importantly — a worthy successor to the original Hades".</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up," the post concludes. "While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades II is still to come, so <em>may moonlight guide us!</em>"</p>
<p>It has felt like a long time coming, but boy are we excited to see what the full release has to offer. We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-hades-2-is-a-hell-of-a-time-even-in-early-access">hands-on</a> with the early access build last year, and we were delighted by what we saw. Heck, if this sequel is even a fraction as compelling as its predecessor, we're going to be in for an almighty time sink when it finally lands on Switch.</p>
