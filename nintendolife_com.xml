<p>Multiple ratings have already been spotted</p>

<figure><a title="SpongeBob SquarePants" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcf2cf994a6b2/spongebob-squarepants.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch was treated to multiple SpongeBob games during its prime, and it looks like a new game in the popular Nickelodeon series could now be on its way to Switch 2.</p>
<p>The title <strong>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</strong> was rated in <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1930695174461554999">South Korea and Germany recently</a>. Adding to this, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/bob-leponge-est-de-retour-un-nouveau-jeu-video-prevu-pour-cet-automne-60284">Dealabs and Billbil-Kun report</a> it's coming to multiple current-generation platforms including the Switch 2, and it's expected to surface this November.</p>
<p>This game will apparently retail for $39.99 USD (<em>or the regional equivalent</em>) and a physical version is also believed to be on the way to the Switch 2. Right now, there's "no trace" of a Switch version of this game.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we haven't had any official announcements from publisher THQ Nordic just yet. This follows the same source providing an update about the rumoured <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">Plants vs. Zombies</a> remaster.</p>
<p>Sega also recently revealed SpongeBob would be showing up in the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> game later this year, and earlier this week, Nickelodeon's new multiplayer game (featuring SpongeBob) locked in a release date for Switch.</p>

<figure><a title="Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e3a1d01f39248/bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Here we are once more at the end of July. DK arrived on Switch 2 over a week ago and it seems that most people are absolutely loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> - most, but not <em>all</em>, unfortunately!</p>
<p>Nearly 1 in 10 players responding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/poll-has-donkey-kong-bananza-made-you-feel-ill">in our poll</a> say they're getting sick when playing the game. The exact cause is up for debate, with the camera's 'following' behaviour and the game's smashable terrain being likely culprits upsetting a sizeable minority of DK fans. That doesn't seem to have hurt sales of the game, mind, even if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/japanese-charts-donkey-kong-bananza-sells-a-bunch-but-cant-beat-mario-kart">Kong can't quite compete</a> with launch game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Jamboree</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">returned on Switch 2</a>, a small selection of the still-new console's games got discounted in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/112-games-you-should-pick-up-in-nintendos-summer-switch-eshop-sale-europe">Nintendo's Summer Sale</a>, Direct predictions continue <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">on the weekly</a>, the Pokémon Presents...well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">it happened</a> (PokéPark Kanto <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/the-new-pokemon-theme-park-is-looking-rather-lovely">looks nice</a>, at least!), and Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-still-doesnt-want-you-to-talk-about-the-switch-online-playtest-program">unmentionable</a> Playtest is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-switch-online-playtest-program-returning-includes-switch-2-support">back for a second round</a> next week.</p>
<p>Let's see if Team NL can break away from DK, shall we?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It won't shock you to know that I'm also playing Donkey Kong Bananza, and having an absolute whale of a time (no, there's no Whale Bananza transformation. Sorry). But I'm a lot further behind than everyone else, so I'm hoping to make some big, destructive progress this weekend.</p>
<p><em>"But wait, Alana, what about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>?"</em> Well... I'm 60 hours in and still haven't finished. It's taken a back seat until DK is done, but I'm dipping in and out of it still. I did, however, pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> in the sale the other day, so my little Fantasy Life might have to wait a bit longer.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm only a few hours into Bananza, but I've been loving it. However, I'm in a pickle of my own making.</p>
<p>My nephew was visiting earlier in the week and instead of making a save file and letting him branch off, I let him carry on auto-saving on my file and there's maybe an hour's worth of progress that isn't technically mine. Firing up my save, I'm beside a minecart in an area I've never visited...and I've got an awful itch to just start from scratch!</p>
<p>That I'm even contemplating a restart speaks to the quality of the game. The kids are getting no end of pleasure from every single "Ohhh, BaNAHna!", so I <em>might</em> just begin again. Good game.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> out of the way, it's time to get back into the streets of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and continue my World Tour playthrough. I do want to jump back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> but at the same time I don’t want to commit to another time-consuming game because my musical career demands some Summer releases.</p>
<p>It’s kinda scary that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> plot resonates so much with current affairs, even more so because when it was first released in 1999, it all seemed so far in a distant future and unlikely, but hey, here we are. I'll continue progress on that along with some more <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_4">Tekken 4</a> before jumping into <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_5">Tekken 5</a>. I am also on the home stretch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, just in time to try out the new DLC campaign next.</p>
<p>Game of the week is — really to no one’s surprise — Donkey Kong Bananza. I have been neglecting it because I’m saving those bananas for my Summer vacations. Smashing stuff is fun!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>After playing nothing but DK, DK and more DK, I think I’m in need of a change of pace. I’ve taken a shine to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1 + 2 Replay</a> for something completely different, and I’m still enjoying dipping into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> every now and then for a little retro Zelda kick.</p>
<p>Oh shoot, I’ve just remembered that I also have my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> save file glaring at me. I should probably get back to that at some point too…</p>

<p>"We understand this is disappointing"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>-inspired 3D action-adventure game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/knightling">The Knightling</a> will be launching this August on multiple platforms, but the Switch version of the game has been axed.</p>
<p>In an update earlier today, developer Twirlbound announced the game had "gone gold" ahead of the August release window for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, but also revealed it would "no longer" be releasing on Nintendo's Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We also wanted to let everyone know that we are no longer releasing The Knightling for Nintendo Switch. This was a difficult decision for us and we understand this is disappointing for fans who have been anticipating the Switch release."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this launch will still go ahead for other platforms on <strong>28th August 2025</strong>, but it's game over for the Switch version. Unsurprisingly, fans are already calling for a Switch 2 release, so if we hear anything about this in the future, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Focused on expanding anime IP and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Digimon Story Time Stranger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd357dd40df66/digimon-story-time-stranger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some more Sony news, the PlayStation maker has this week acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>It's described as a "strategic business alliance agreement" with a focus on "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement". It reportedly sets Sony back "around $464 million" (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712901/sony-buys-a-stake-in-bandai-namco">via The Verge</a>).</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco and Sony have historically collaborated on various projects in the fields such as games, anime and music, and they plan to extend this collaboration to a broader range of areas. The two companies intend to implement initiatives including the expansion of works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising. They also plan to engage in detailed discussions regarding the joint development and promotion of IP such as anime and manga, in addition to planning and technical collaboration on experiential entertainment. Furthermore, the two companies plan to explore opportunities to support creators by jointly developing and operating entertainment-related technologies and services, and to engage in joint investments and business alliances in fan engagement areas."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony has previously invested in Kadakowa (the parent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> developer FromSoftware) in a new "alliance" last year.</p>
<p>As our pals at Pure Xbox mention, this latest partnership makes "transmedia opportunities" tied to areas like anime and manga "the priority". Sony also owns platforms like the anime streaming service <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>, which is available as an app on multiple platforms including Switch.</p>

<p>"Your memories will be recorded here"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>This year marks the tenth anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> and the game's creator Toby Fox is wanting to reflect on this time with your memories.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1948945089939788235">post on social media</a>, he's revealed how he's seeking "your memories" and wants to "turn back together". He's hoping for a quick turnover – further noting how it would be "great" if fans could submit their responses within the <strong>next 24 hours</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> "Hello. It's almost been 10 years since UNDERTALE released. Now, I'm looking for your memories. Let's turn back together. Face the flower and speak."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems the website where you can record your memory is already being overloaded with responses as well, so try again later if you have any trouble submitting your memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are so many submissions, the site is having trouble... If your submission is stuck on 'Submitting', please try sending it again later. Your submission should be auto-saved in your browser."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So head on over to <a href="https://memories.undertale.com/">memories.undertale.com</a> and record your memory now!</p>
<p>Although it has been almost ten years since original release, this title didn't arrive on the Switch eShop until 2018. It's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/sans_from_undertale_is_coming_to_super_smash_bros_ultimate">led to cameos</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and Toby releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, which was recently made available on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-lots-of-pokemon-champions-details-leaked/">as highlighted by Nintendo Everything</a>, there are supposedly new details about the game emerging. This information is based on some previous leaks, which have apparently been "partially verified" by the latest broadcast:<strong><br></strong></p>

<p>While we won't be directly sharing anything about the <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-lots-of-pokemon-champions-details-leaked/">gameplay or content</a>, we will mention how the leak claims the release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a> is taking place early next year. Additionally, it's said to be a "free" download on multiple platforms, including Switch 2, although there does seem to be some scepticism about this within the Pokémon community.</p>
<p>Just this week, The Pokémon Company launched a new puzzle game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a>, which is available as a free-to-play download on mobile and a paid game on the Switch with additional transactions for both versions. Other Pokémon games in the past have opted for free download models across both platforms, and there's also the premium console experiences.</p>
<p>Of course, this story is labelled as a rumour, so nothing mentioned above from the reported leak has been officially confirmed. Hopefully, though, we don't have to wait much longer for the next battle-focused entry to arrive. In the meantime, trainers can also look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, arriving this October.</p>
<p>Previous updates about Pokémon Champions have revealed there will be certain limitations when this title does launch, with only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/pokemon-champions-limited-to-select-pokemon-at-launch">"select Pokémon" to be available</a> for use, and plans to seemingly expand the roster as time goes on.</p>

<p>Going "beyond" PlayStation</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Helldivers 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6b508f7a0142/helldivers-2.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Sony surprised the video game community earlier this month when it was revealed it would be bringing Arrowhead's multiplayer hit <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/helldivers_2">Helldivers 2</a></strong> to Xbox.</p>
<p>Now, in another development, a <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5587289004">new job opening</a> has been spotted for PlayStation's head office, and it's apparently searching for a director to lead PlayStation's exploration of systems beyond the PS5 (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/sony-job-listing-implies-more-ps5-exclusives-will-be-ported-to-xbox-nintendo">thanks, Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>The description mentions how this role will shape and execute the company's global commercial strategy for "PS Studios software titles" across all digital platforms (including Nintendo), and will lead a team "focused on multiplatform expansion".</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6euxilrg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Reporting to the Vice President, Commercial Management as Senior Director of Multiplatform &amp; Account Management, you will play a critical leadership role in shaping and executing the global commercial strategy for PS Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile. This role is accountable for optimising title profitability, ensuring cross-functional alignment, and leading a high-performing team focused on multiplatform expansion, mid-range commercial planning, and platform partner management."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This role will also reportedly include maintaining relationships with rival platform holders, with the application name-dropping Nintendo twice.</p>
<p>This latest listing follows Sony previously releasing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> on the Switch. It's also been making its first-party console exclusives available on PC for some time now, and is again branching out with Helldivers 2, which offers live service content.</p>
<p>As our colleagues at Push Square have noted, the advertised role doesn't necessarily confirm a shift or change in Sony's current strategy, and it could simply be planning to continue what it's been doing up until now.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws releases on Switch 2 this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/343efa136838a/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot mentioned recently how he was hopeful the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> could <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/ubisofts-yves-guillemot-is-hopeful-that-upcoming-switch-2-port-can-revive-star-wars-outlaws">potentially revive the game</a>. While there's always a chance, beyond this adventure, the future doesn't sound very promising for Kay Vess and Nix.</p>
<p>According to a new scoop by Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, a sequel to Outlaws was originally planned but was recently scrapped in the "very early" stages. This information was shared on the <a href="https://youtu.be/1bFaIYn9H3g">same outlet's weekly podcast</a>. Here's exactly what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They [Ubisoft] also recently cancelled Star Wars Outlaws 2, because that was planned and in the works. It didn’t enter production, as far as I know. It wasn’t set in stone."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/ubisofts-disastrous-2024-may-lead-to-the-company-going-private">hasn't had the best run over the past year</a> – with multiple titles, including Star Wars Outlaws, falling short of the company's financial expectations, along with delays of games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> (a title which could also potentially be on the way to the Switch 2 in the future).</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will launch for the Switch 2 on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>. If we hear anything else about the supposed sequel and its cancellation, we'll let you know.</p>
