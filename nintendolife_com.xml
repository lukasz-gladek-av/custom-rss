<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Sweating Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44ebc7c7f82fc/donkey-kong-sweating-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever the weather in Japan reached particularly high temperatures throughout the Switch's lifespan, Nintendo would release a statement reminding everyone that the OG hybrid was not cut out for such conditions. As it turns out, the Switch 2 is no different (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-warns-japanese-players-not-to-play-switch-2-in-extreme-temperatures">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>Japan has been experiencing a huge heatwave in recent weeks, with unprecedented temperatures launching the region to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/hot-weather-japan-south-korea-record-breaking-heat">all-time high of 41.2 degrees Celsius</a> (around 106 degrees Fahrenheit). Expectedly, not a lot of household tech is designed to work in this heat, and Nintendo has released a <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651">statement</a> via its Japanese customer support Twitter account to clarify that the Switch 2 is no exception.</p>
<p>The statement reminds everyone that the console is best suited to environments between 5-35 degrees Celsius, with anything outside of this range running the risk of a "malfunction" (via Google Translate). "We have seen several days recently where temperatures have exceeded 35°C," the message concludes, "Please be careful when using the console outdoors".</p>

<p>Now, that bracket is nothing new — Nintendo has issued <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/07/dont-use-your-switch-in-temperatures-exceeding-35c-warns-nintendo">the exact same advice for the Switch 1</a> in the past — but it's still something to pay attention to as the particularly sweaty summer keeps ticking on.</p>

<figure><a title="Missing games from partner showcase 25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d71a8727a49bd/missing-games-from-partner-showcase-25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, we were all quite excited, we think it's fair to say, about Nintendo's Partner Showcase last week and, in the end, it seemed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-switch-2-needed-a-partner-showcase-with-pep-this-wasnt-it">a little light on heavy-hitting or exciting stuff in all honesty</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, we expected a little more sugar, a few surprises to whet our appetites on the third-party front, since the initial wave of excitement, for early adopters at least, may be somewhat wearing off.</p>
<p>Now though, Chris Dring, long-serving game industry journalist, and current Editor-In-Chief and Co-Founder of The Game Business (so he proper knows stuff), has taken to his social media with the following, very teasing, little nugget of info. There were three games missing from the showcase, that he knows of (cheers for the head's up, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/02/chris-dring-says-he-knows-3-games-pulled-from-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase/">MyNintendoNews</a>)!</p>

<p>Hmmm. Well now. Of course, there's no indication of what these games were, but they must have been reasonably sizeable, you would think, for folk to have been made aware of them pre-show. It's not like he's been informed of three unmissable highlight reel games that would have been lost in the mix, we shouldn't think, these may have been somewhat substantial, and somewhat more of what the showcase needed in general.</p>
<p>So what were the games do we reckon? Well, pure speculation, but surely Silksong must have been in the works for a peek...surely? And this particular writer refuses to believe they didn' pull a Vanquish Remastered reveal at the last second (I can dream, can't I?).</p>
<hr>
<p><em>What do you reckon the missing games could have been, and which titles could have made it a better showcase all-round? Make sure to let us know!</em></p></section>

<p>C. Viper returns this Autumn</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following a leak earlier on, Capcom has now officially released the teaser trailer for the next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC character.</p>
<p>The secret agent C. Viper, who originally made her debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>, is scheduled to arrive in Street Fighter 6's World Tour, Battle Hub and Fighting Grounds on <strong>Autumn 2025</strong> for all platforms including the Switch 2.</p>
<p>She's part of the game's third year of DLC, which also includes Sagat (out this week), as well as Alex (<strong>Early Spring 2026</strong>) and Ingrid (<strong>Late Spring 2026</strong>).</p>

<p>In addition to this, Capcom has released a new trailer for the next batch of DLC outfits coming to the game.</p>

<p>Apart from these new trailers for Street Fighter 6, one other Capcom announcement at EVO 2025 was a free title update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>. It's out this week and will add Ingrid as well as multiple other characters to Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and Street Fighter 6 in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life. There's also a demo for the sixth entry available on the Switch 2.</p>

<figure><a title="Dk map article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4782dfb7bef11/dk-map-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of fun to be had in smashing the place to tiny little voxel pieces in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, it's easily its biggest draw. People have been into the sweet catharsis of wanton destruction since way back before there were even people. Probably.</p>
<p>However, the one thing that's caught my attention most whilst playing thus far - and I must admit, I'm only around about halfway through the campaign at this point - is the game's absolutely beautiful world map design. I love it.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't have the same level of interactivity and usefulness as some other games do, and sometimes it gets lost when you've dug through miles of terrain, but it's not about that. Donkey Kong Bananza's map's strength lies in how it gives you the actual level you are on, fully realised as adorable 3D miniature, like a diorama that you can swirl around and see exactly what is in front, to the side, above, below and beyond you.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>When you press the map button, the camera zips you up and out of the level to look down upon the earth like some sort of hairy, banana-addled God. What's more, it tallies all of your actions and activities and replicates all the damage you've done across the layer. It's a magic, real-time tracker kind of thing, and it's got me dazzled.</p>
<p>There's almost a game within a game here where you can set points of interest or places you want to get to just for fun, rather than for the sake of progression, and then work through the area both in-game and through the map, jumping seamlessly too and fro, in order to do some satisfying messing around and discovering. I love how it orientates you, too. Jump into this map and direct yourself towards something, then back out and DK is pointed where you are headed.</p>
<p>It also allows you to do fun things with the landscape. I mean, who knows what I could sculpt that great big mountain in the distance into if I really <em>think</em> about it? And when I've decided, I can go into the map to get a bird's eye view on the progress of my mountain that's shaped like Wario's butt. Woah! Wait a minute.... Where did that come from?</p>

<p>The more intricate the level, the more impressed I am. I've spent far too much time spinning these maps around and resetting the terrain so it's all fresh and new and ready to destroy all over again. And, for a game that's got so much going on elsewhere, this ingenious little map really has become the cherry on top for me.</p>
<p>Of course Nintendo is no stranger to the World Of Very Good World Maps™. In fact, one of my earliest and most lasting memories of gaming is how blown away I was by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</a>'s map back in the days when I'd play my full-colour games on a barely working black and white TV. Yes, I am a dinosaur. And a bald one, to boot.</p>
<p>The parallaxing wonder that was A Link to the Past's map though, my goodness. And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/5j835r/map_of_hyrule_legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past/">you got a paper copy of it in the box as well</a>. Halcyon days. It was the first time I'd seen a map and thought of it as an organic and useful part of a game as a whole. It wasn't some stuffy menu that was separated off; it put you above the world, not removed temporarily to the back rooms, still in-game, just from a different perspective. It's amazing how much this adds to the escapism of an adventure. It certainly had 13 year old me more invested in a game than I'd ever been before.</p>

<p>Zelda has continued to innovate and impress in the cartography department, too. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> give us these enormously complex maps that show you where you need to go and where you've just been. They also retain the magic of A Link to the Past's effort by teasing you ahead of time, showing you places that you want to go, intriguing things you want to see or mess with. These maps do their jobs by being a guiding companion, but they also keep you hooked by enhancing the game's ability to embed you in its world.</p>
<p>Then we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, another game that absolutely floored me with its map. Previously I'd found Metroid a little tortuous — sometimes you blame yourself in tough situations, saying you're just not good enough or patient enough to play that type of game. But it was the map's fault! Blame the game, give yourself a mental health break. As soon as you popped in Super Metroid's cartridge, with its incredibly useful maze of a map, everything clicked into place. Ah yes, this is why people like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> and why there are <em>so many</em> Metroidvanias out there. Thanks maps!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> carries on in the same glorious vein; its map is another ludicrously labyrinthian affair, but your path and location remain crystal clear an all times. And the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_trilogy">Prime Trilogy</a> map, well, it's just more of that good gravy. Not as fundamentally game-changing as its predecessors, perhaps, but certainly showing that the love is still there, and now lifted into three dimensions. It makes me sick to think about how complicated creating this stuff must be, which is a sure sign that it's a good thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> is another example of a map I was in love with as a kid. Again, not the most useful, overall, but it doesn't need to be. It looks amazing, it's interactive as you move across the paths that link all the levels together, and it keeps you in the world, in that <em>not-real-life</em> headspace, which is where I belong.</p>
<p>And just like all the other games mentioned, it teases you in the same ways. You immediately need to know where all those little caves go, what that suspicious patch is over there, etc. And all of this is to speak nothing on how the map designs add to, or even speak to, the style, the vibe, and the architecture of the worlds that they're a part of. They fit, they enhance and they improve.</p>

<p>So, whilst smashing the place to a billion beautiful pieces in Bananza, zipping in and out of its map, twirling and zooming, plotting and planning, I've been reminded in a wonderfully nostalgic burst of all this lovely stuff. It's nice to see that, as much as the technology may change and gamers might want different things from the experiences they buy into, Nintendo has stuck to giving us some of the best maps in the industry.</p>
<p>When you think about all these maps, especially with how complex the latest Zelda ones have been, it feels like a bit of a full circle moment that, in DK's latest outing; you get to tear the map apart until there's nothing but the skeleton of a world remaining.</p>
