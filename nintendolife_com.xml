<figure data-uuid="600566d7d39eb"><a title="New Horizons 3.0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/600566d7d39eb/new-horizons-3-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, that's a nice surprise! In what is likely a move to align all regions with New Zealand (where it's now gone 1am on the 15th), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' 3.0 update is available for download.</p>
<p>You might need to manually apply the update – in which case you simply press '+' on the game's icon and select 'Software Update' – but otherwise, you should be good to go.</p>
<p>There are no official patch notes at the time of writing as we can see, but if you've been eagerly anticipating this new update, then you'll likely already know the gist. Version 3.0 contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resort Hotel</li>
<li>Island Speciality Requests</li>
<li>Slumber Island</li>
<li>Resetti's Reset Service</li>
<li>Collaborations (LEGO and The Legend of Zelda amiibo)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be crystal clear, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of the game is not yet live. This is available to purchase separately or via an Upgrade Pack. If you've pre-ordered the Upgrade Pack, you may see the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' icon on your home screen, but the original Switch 1 version will boot up when you open it.</p>

<p>We go again with a Victory Road "sequel"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="75edb9732b962"><a title="Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75edb9732b962/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>After many years of waiting, fans of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven</a> series were beginning to question if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> would ever see the light of day. Fortunately, Level-5 dug deep and was able to <em>finally</em> release the title on the Switch and Switch 2 in November last year.</p>
<p>It's already getting some updates <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/inazuma-eleven-victory-roads-second-major-free-update-kicks-off-this-month">with more to come</a>, but that's not all - with the Level-5 president and CEO Akihiro Hino (who has filled many roles at the company over the years) mentioning how he's already started writing the scenario for a "sequel" to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road. Yep, you read that correctly! We've even got a little detail about it.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hlksjt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the rundown from the latest <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/level-5-president-akihiro-hino-has-begun-writing-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sequel">Ina-Dai broadcast via Gematsu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akihiro Hino:</strong> “As for the sequel to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, I have already started writing the scenario. As a ‘new Inazuma Eleven‘ that begins in the Reiwa era, I will do my best to deliver surprise and excitement to everyone once again. Please look forward to future announcements.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source also notes how "despite its recent release, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road was announced in July 2016-during the Heisei era. The Reiwa era began on May 1, 2019".</p>
<p>It's worth noting how the Level-5 CEO previously mentioned how a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-final-trailers-ending-theme-song-music-video-and-latest-details">"potential sequel" would support</a> the "Player Bank" data from this current release. Of course, this "sequel" could still be years out, and it isn't exactly uncommon for developers within the games industry to jump straight into the next major title like this (or even have some sort of overlap between projects).</p>
<p>Still, we're <em>almost</em> exhausted just hearing this, as it took so long for Victory Road to arrive on the Switch - with multiple name changes and revisions along the way (with the latest one taking place in 2022), and the game also launching on the Switch 2 in the end.</p>
<p>For now, fans of the current release (<em>that's Victory Road</em>) can look forward to the second major free update, which will roll out on <strong>28th January 2026</strong>. You can find out a little more about this in our previous story here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Following a studio closure last week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d264bf87b4d78"><a title="Ubisoft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d264bf87b4d78/ubisoft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>A week after we heard about Ubisoft's closure of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-starts-the-new-year-with-a-studio-closure-71-jobs-affected">mobile game-focused studio Ubisoft Halifax</a>, news has now surfaced about the third-party publisher laying off people at two other teams as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>According to a report from IGN, Ubisoft "expects 55 jobs" to be impacted at the Swedish Studios Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm following a voluntary leave program in fall 2025 that apparently fell short of its target.</p>
<p>Massive is known for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/division_2">The Division</a> and Ubisoft Stockholm has been working on an <a href="https://stockholm.ubisoft.com/">unannounced (and new) IP</a> as well as cloud computing technology.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6EOKFq0qA_o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6EOKFq0qA_o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60cf74svxghq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the lengthy statement from Ubisoft, highlighting these studio restructuring measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ubisoft:</strong> Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructure that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.</p>
<p>This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.</p>
<p>These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.</p>
<p>The long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged, and we will continue to serve as the global home and lead for to The Division franchise, move forward with an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup, and play a central role in the development of Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect inline with local regulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development on The Division series is still expected to continue "as a matter of priority", and as noted, the "long-term direction" for both of these studios "remains unchanged".</p>
<p>The Malmö-based developer Massive also happens to be behind the Snowdrop engine, which powered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - a game released on Switch 2 last year.</p>
