<p>Vroom for four, and 120fps mode to boot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>3Goo, which has previously published the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gear_club_unlimited_2_-_definitive_edition">Gear.Club</a> series and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wrc_generations">WRC Generations</a> on Nintendo consoles, has announced a brand new multiplayer grand-prix racer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/4pgp-four-player-grand-prix">4PGP: Four-Player Grand Prix</a>, which releases on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, has a phenomenally straight-forward moniker, and we reckon that suits its aims as a no-nonsense 90s-style racer just fine, as the keyword here is "simplicity" in being able to pick up and play, with easy to grasp controls.</p>
<p>That extends to the visuals too, in the clean and simplistic graphical style adopted to bring this arcade speeding to life with 4K and 120fps on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The game also features track "design contributions" from Kenji Sasaki, who of course designed the tracks for little known racers such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> and <strong>Sega Rally</strong>. Hold on, what? Excuse us? Oh, and you've also got a soundtrack by Tomoyuki Kawamura, who did the music for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/sega_rally_championship">Sega Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/virtua_racing">Virtua Racing</a>. Wow.</p>
<p>Here's some more deets from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arcade Racing for Every Skill Level:</strong></p>
<p>Four difficulty settings, Rookie, Novice, Veteran, and Expert, as well as an Assist Mode for younger racers, making it easy for newcomers to jump in while giving experienced racers a real challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem with Game Share:</strong></p>
<p>Race solo or with up to four players in split-screen, and join friends with GameShare locally on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, or play online with others on Nintendo Switch 2 via GameChat.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Game Modes:</strong></p>
<p>Hop into Quick Races for instant fun, tackle a full set of courses in Championship Mode, or chase perfect laps in Time Attack Mode.</p>
<p><strong>Unlockable Tracks and Vehicles:</strong></p>
<p>Race and unlock an expanding lineup of 14 circuits and build out your collection of 19 cars.</p>
<p><strong>90s Vibe, Modern Tech:</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy a 90s-inspired arcade racing feel paired with modern visuals and performance, powered by a custom engine. For Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, the game supports 4K resolution and 120fps.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We like the look of this one, and if 3goo can nail the driving, get the arcade feel just right and give online that works well, this one could fill a proper hole in our Switch libraries when it comes to F1-style racing with pals. We're also totally down for that price point of <strong>$24.99</strong> on Switch 2 and <strong>$19.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>

Discovery to acquire Warner Bros. in a deal that's valued at roughly <strong>$82.7 billion</strong> — an equity value of $72 billion.</p>
<p>Netflix is specifically acquiring Warner Bros.' Streaming &amp; Studios company, which <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_presentations/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Investor-Presentation-06-09-25.pdf">it created in June 2025</a> and includes including <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, the DC Universe, <strong>Harry Potter</strong>, <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong>, and platforms such as HBO and HBO Max and Warner Bros.

<p>The media company doesn't mention WB's gaming division at all in its press release. However, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">Game Developer</a> has confirmed with a WB spokesperson that "the recently-restructured video game division... will be joining Netflix."</p>
<p>Currently, Warner Bros. Games includes a number of studios such as Rocksteady (<strong>Batman: Arkham</strong> series), NetherRealm Studios (<strong>Mortal Kombat</strong>), TT Games (<strong>LEGO</strong>), Portkey Games, and Avalanche Studios (Harry Potter), along with WB's studios in Boston, Montréal, New York, and San Francisco.</p>
<p>It's a huge deal that Netflix expect to take around 12-18 months, but that's if it goes through. We know how long <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/its-over-microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard">other huge acquisitions have taken</a>. Plus regulators are more than likely to get involved. Paramount had previously attempted to purchase the studio in October, which was rejected.</p>

<p>If successful, Warner Bros. shareholders will receive $27.75 a share along with stock in Netflix and the company expects to make savings of around $2-$3 billion by the third year.</p>
<p>The deal could have a huge impact on these studios, and is yet another example of consolidation in the video game industry at a time when layoffs, game studio sales, and closures are rampant.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">reports emerged</a> that Netflix was selling Spry Fox, developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cozy_grove">Cozy Grove</a>, back to the owners.</p>
