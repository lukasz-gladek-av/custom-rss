<p>Ahhh, memories</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>XSEED Games has announced that it's bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_memories_of_celceta">Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</a> to Switch in the West in early 2026.</p>
<p>In case you missed this one, Revelations in Celceta enhanced port of the PlayStation Vita game (which later came to PC and PS4) <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/ys_memories_of_celceta">Ys: Memories of Celceta</a>. Can you see <em>why</em> they changed the name? Memoire: Memories is a bit of a mouthful... well, Falcom kept it for its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/ps-vitas-ys-memoire-memories-of-celceta-lands-switch-remaster-in-japan-this-may">Japanese release in May 2025</a>. So, y'know.</p>
<p>Anyway, Revelations in Celceta is actually the <em>true</em> fourth game in the Ys series; Falcom originally outsourced development of a fourth game to two seperate companies in the early '90s, which in turn gave us two different <strong>Ys IV</strong>s. Timeline wise, it takes place directly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X</a> — which is also getting a rerelease in 2026 on Switch 2.</p>
<p>This rerelease will allow you to swap between the original soundtrack and a brand new, rearranged version. And, from the look and sound of it, that seems like the main addition.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the action RPG from XSEED, along with some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</em></strong> Key Features</p>
<p><strong>- Exhilarating Party-based Action:</strong> Strategic party battles challenge players to change their tactics on the fly, and allies can pick up new abilities in the midst of battle that can help them gain the advantage against powerful enemies.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Exploration of a Dangerous Land:</strong> Celceta is a vast and mysterious land, filled with interesting people and thrilling adventures. Players can take advantage of a robust mapping system as they discover all the challenges and rewards that await.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Enhanced Musical Experience:</strong> The sweeping score guiding Adol’s journey through Celceta returns, along with a newly recorded, re-interpreted version, allowing players to choose their own auditory adventure.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So, we don't have too long to wait. Oh, and if you want to catch up on your Ys, this is the second game in the Memoire project — which is porting the older games to Switch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_the_oath_in_felghana">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</a>, which launched earlier this year, is a fantastic place to start.</p>

<figure><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43834270dc9bd/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like many first-party Nintendo games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is absolutely stuffed with fun little details and easter eggs.</p>
<p>Some are pretty obvious, like the short challenge level that's basically a recreation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, but others take a little more time and patience to notice. For example, you might be so busy smashing up the environment to even clock on that Pauline's idle animation actually changes throughout the game.</p>
<p>We mentioned this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">our review</a>, but it's such a small little detail and it can easily be missed if you're too busy having fun. Essentially, though, as Pauline gets more comfortable in the presence of Donkey Kong, her mood will begin to lighten. So she'll go from looking worried to playfully ruffling DK's fur, and even going so far as to tickle him. It's adorable!</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4sthxzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1960742460008591862">Supper Mario Broth</a>, the social media channel known for posting obscure Nintendo facts, showcases it wonderfully in the below video:</p>

<p>It just goes to show the care and attention that Nintendo gives to its creations, lending real authenticity to DK and Pauline's growing friendship throughout the game.</p>
<p>In other news, latest figures from the US indicate that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/donkey-kong-bananza-is-selling-like-bananas-on-switch-2-us">Bananza has sold incredibly well in the region</a>, reaching number three in the list of best-selling games during July 2025; a feat made more impressive when you consider that Nintendo doesn't share digital sales.</p>

We have known this for a while, of course, but it looks like TCG fans in select regions will have to wait a little longer before they can get their hands on the upcoming creatively-titled 'Mega Evolution' set, as The Pokémon Company has announced a delay.</p>
<p>In a statement on the Pokémon TCG UK <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGUK/status/1960689456857456667">Twitter</a> account, the company revealed that the set has been "slightly delayed in EMEA markets" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), citing "challenges impacting product delivery dates". The set will now launch on <strong>10th October</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fixmvhy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The region specification has us assuming that the expansion will still arrive in other regions as planned on <strong>26th September</strong>, but we'll be sure to keep you updated should we hear any changes.</p>
<p>Here's The Pokémon Company's full statement, followed by the initial tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to challenges impacting product delivery dates, the release of the upcoming Pokémon Trading Card Game: Mega Evolution will be slightly delayed in EMEA markets.<br>
We apologise to our fans and understand that this news may be disappointing. We are working hard alongside our logistics partners to ensure products will be available for purchase from 10th October 2025. We would like to thank our community for their continued support and patience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a reminder, the Mega Evolution set includes almost a dozen Mega Evolution ex cards and over 50 Pokémon and Trainer special illustration cards. In short, there's a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>Alongside this set, Mega Evolution will also be making its grand return in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it'll be allowed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, <em>and</em> it's arriving in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> in the Fall. What a time to be a Gen VI fan, eh?</p>
