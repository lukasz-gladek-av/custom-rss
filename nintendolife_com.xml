<p>I hate this wait</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Skybound Entertainment and Broken Mirror Games have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>, the adaptation of the comic series from writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Topilin, will launch on the Switch on <strong>7th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The new trailer also gives us a further glimpse at the craft-based survival horror gameplay, with an isometric viewpoint and cool, stylised visuals paying homage to the comic itself. Developer Broken Mirror Games was founded in 2024 and sits under the larger Bloober Team, which itself is shortly launching <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> on the Switch 2. These folks are all about the horror!</p>
<p>So let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classic Craft-Based Survival Horror</strong> – Scavenge every corner of Rutherford Ranch to stay alive. From haunted forests, a derelict town, to infested bunkers. Explore a world teeming with danger as you gather vital resources, craft essential gear, upgrade your campsite, and rebuild outposts to have somewhere to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Day Prepares You. Night Hunts You</strong> – A dynamic day-night cycle that changes the world. Use daylight wisely to explore, scavenge supplies, craft what you need, and prepare for what’s coming. When night falls, the real nightmares come out to play. More enemies appear, stronger and more aggressive than before. The landscape becomes harder to navigate with just your flashlight. Sometimes your best hope is to find shelter and hunker down till morning.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Silence Goes A Long Way</strong> – Stealth and combat go hand-in-hand here as many of the twisted creatures in Rutherford Ranch hunt and stalk you by sound alone. Brute force will often just land you in an early grave. Use sound to your advantage, luring creatures away from your path or cleverly leading them straight into deadly traps you laid.</p>
<p><strong>80s Vibes Meets Comic Book Flair</strong> – Inspired by the award-nominated comic book series, <em>I Hate This Place</em> comes to life with bold colors, a punchy retro comic book style, and a heavy dose of ’80s flair. A unique blend of horror, dark humor, and just the right touch of camp and gore where unsettling dread meets stylized charm.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2dda7621ffb38/hollow-knight-silksong-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, it has been quite the week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> news, hasn't it? We got a tiny peek at some more gameplay in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-every-switch-1-and-2-announcement-and-trailer">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, Team Cherry revealed a "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-special-announcement-is-coming-this-thursday">special announcement</a>" is coming on Thursday, and now we're getting to go hands-on with the damn thing.</p>
<p>Our more detailed impressions will be coming your way soon enough, but we thought it only right to highlight the game's impressive Switch 2 performance right off the bat: this thing has a mode that supports 120Hz!</p>
<p>Yes, after our brief time with the game, we can confirm that those playing on Switch 2 will be able to explore the all-new kingdom with quite possibly the most frames that the console can muster — talk about buttery smoothness.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jxlvhy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>This increased frame rate falls under the game's 'TV Mode', which boasts a "higher frame rate mode for displays that support 120Hz," though resolution is reduced in the process.</p>
<p>This is a real treat. Now, to be clear, just because the game <em>supports</em> higher frame rates, that doesn't mean it'll necessarily <em>play</em> at 120fps — we'll need further testing to know for sure. But there's room for the upper reaches of the Switch 2, and what we played felt super smooth.</p>
<p>Remember, the Switch 2's capacity for 120fps was one of the big selling points out of the console's reveal Direct, though we haven't seen it used all that often since launch. Select indies like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> have put it into practice, and who can forget its implementation in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>... we did. The next big hitter that we had our eyes on for 120fps gameplay was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (whenever that ends up releasing), so it's nice to hear that Silksong will be accompanying it in the meantime.</p>
<p>All eyes on Thursday's "special announcement" for more information and <em>hopefully</em> a release date.</p>

<p>"Did I startle you..?"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Although many deemed it somewhat tedious, sailing across The Great Sea is what made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, well... <em>The Wind Waker</em>.</p>
<p>It was a really cool mechanic in hindsight, and we don't know about you, but we often fantasised about having our own 'King of the Red Lions' sailboat in real life. Now, thanks to YouTuber and self-proclaimed Zelda fan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Littlejem">Littlejem</a>, one of them <em>actually</em> exists (thanks, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/talented-legend-of-zelda-fan-builds-functional-wind-waker-boat/">FRVR</a>).</p>
<p>Yes, as detailed in her latest video, Littlejem has successfully created a full functional replica of The King of Red Lions. For goodness' sake, the head and mouth even move! It's pretty spectacular. Granted, it's 'sailing' via a motor and not by, y'know, the wind, but the fact that it's even staying afloat is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>The video takes you through the whole creation process, including the initial conception, the building and painting process, and the first on-water test. If you want to check out the finished piece, however, then you can simply skip ahead to the final segment at the 28-minute mark.</p>
<p>Congrats to Littlejem for this incredible creation; it's a great tribute to the game, and we're all for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Kirby has the ability to put everyone in a good mood, right? I mean, I've been in a lovely mood thanks to the pink puffball (and Nintendo), as I was lucky enough to go hands-on with the upcoming racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany.</p>
<p>As a surprising sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> on the GameCube, it's a really fascinating game, and it does, as director Masahiro Sakurai said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>, feel very different to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. So let me run you through what I got to play during my behind-closed-doors session.</p>
<p>I, along with around 20 or so other people, were all shuffled into a room together where, to my surprise, we got to watch the Direct together. Here is where I started really falling for this game. This was the first time we'd seen any gameplay, and it looked great. But the way Sakurai presents and goes into so much detail is what really did it for me.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/506543d4217a3/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not a picture of me winning... but I did win! — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right after the Direct, I got to go hands-on with the game, where I started off with some Lessons covering how to boost dash, drift, fly, land, capture enemies, etc. I only got to try a handful of these (through numbers three to nine) but these were really nice and helped me get to grips with the controls and movement.</p>
<p>If you've played Kirby Air Ride before, then you'll be familiar with the controls, but I haven't. The GameCube game only came out a year after I was born <em>(Ouch, I feel my back creaking... Ed~)</em>; of course, I could have gone back and played it (though it's <a href="https://www.ebay.com/b/Kirby-Air-Ride-Video-Games/139973/bn_7368608?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">not exactly the cheapest game</a>), but I was never really intrigued to check it out. However, now the new one is on the way? My goodness.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had to learn how to turn, which sounds a bit silly, but in Kirby Air Riders and its predecessor, you don't need to accelerate with the 'A' button, you just... <em>go</em>. So that took some getting used to. In the original game, you only used one button for everything, including to stop so you could turn your vehicle (called machines) around and then boost ahead. But in Air Riders, the devs have added a second button — yes, very exciting — which allows your racer to use their Special move.</p>
<p>Learning all of this didn't take very long, and I also found out by tilting the left stick side-to-side, you can do a spin attack and ram into other opponents. You can even inhale other characters and copy them. There's <em>a lot</em> of stuff going on.</p>
<p>After Lessons, we were all thrown into two regular races in Air Ride mode. I got to race on Floral Fields and Wave Flow Waters and I was really impressed by both courses. I tried out some different combos of characters and machines, too. For one of the pairings, my turns were really slow but had good speed otherwise, plus my character had an excellent special which helped me win the second race, even though we were playing with bots.</p>

<p>That all changed when we dived into City Trial, the big, meaty event for Kirby Air Riders. Here, we got to play three times and we were against three other people. This was a hugely popular mode in the original game, but here, it's been fleshed out and improved massively. In Air Riders, for example, you can simply switch karts seamlessly driving into them and pressing 'Y' rather than jumping off one and on another, and you get little suggestions on the screen that tell you what you might want to do next. And, at the end of a City Trial session, you all get to vote on the final minigame which you're all building up to.</p>
<p><em>'But wait, Felix, building up? Changing karts? What are you talking about?'</em> Well, in City Trial, you're driving around on this big island called Skyah, and it is <em>really</em> big, and you need to find a vehicle to upgrade to from your basic Warp Star. Then you drive around and collect all sorts of different power-ups — you can increase speed, air-time, boost your attack, defense, there are so many things to collect.</p>
<p>While I was collecting these upgrades and messing around, I discovered something that Sakurai also briefly stumbled upon during the Direct, a sort of glass-looking satellite in the sky which I thought was really cool. Not only are there secrets to find, but there are also multiple events taking place on the map too like big spiky balls falling from the sky, Kracko making an appearance, or a quick race where the winner in first-place will win lots of power-ups.</p>

<p>All of this is meant to get you to build the best possible vehicle for the final minigame in the Stadium. This can be a handful of options from Air Rider, which tests you on who can fly the farthest, or it can be a big brawl in Dustup Derby. It can even be a Gourmet Race, which tasks you with eating the most food. It's all really varied and exciting.</p>
<p>I think my biggest issue with City Trial is that you have five-minutes to go and collect all these power-ups, which to me is a little bit too long. Now it looks like there's lots of customisation in this game, so I'm hoping that means we can change or lower the time. It might be better when you're playing with 16 real people, but it felt a little anticlimactic when I played with just three others as, when we got to the final challenge, because we each voted on different minigames every time, we'd end up racing CPU-controlled rivals. We did eventually team up and vote for the same challenge for the last one, and , well, I actually won that one!</p>

<p>Another problem I had was that sometimes you can go <em>so fast</em> that it's hard to even know what's happening on the screen. Maybe it's my fault for aiming for the quickest stats, but this is where I started to experience a little bit of motion sickness. Now, you know I've also struggled with this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but with Kirby, it's not only me as one of the Nintendo representatives said that they actually got motion sickness playing the game, too.</p>
<p>It also might have to do with the fact we were sitting really close to a big TV (they were close together and we were advised to sit back if we could, which I did) so our whole depth-of-field was just Kirby Air Riders at maximum speed going left and right. So I'll have to see how I cope when the game launches.</p>
<p>There's a lot we still haven't seen, but even this early on, there's so much variety. In the character roster, for instance, not only are there many cool and weird picks like Susie (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kirby_planet_robobot">Planet Robobot</a>) and Gooey (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kirbys_dream_land_2">Kirby's Dream Land 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/kirbys_dream_land_3">3</a>) but they all have multiple costumes. Kirby comes in pink, yellow, purple, and one other colour, while King Dedede has his standard red robes alongside a blue robe and a pink one. Some only have two, while Kirby has the most at four (for now). I also really love that <em>all</em> of the characters, not just Kirby, can copy abilities, this alone makes it feel different than Mario Kart, and I can't wait to see what Meta Knight looks like holding a microphone.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm worried that City Trial will get old and I think it's a little odd that the final minigame splits your group of 16 into four different groups — there's the option to vote for a random challenge, which will then just throw you into a random minigame or group at the end, so I think the voting system is the best solution we have right now for variety. On the whole, though, I enjoyed Air Ride mode the most because I felt the adrenaline rush more.</p>
<p>Graphically and musically, however, this game is fantastically phenomenal, it's got that Sakurai magic. The colours pop, the animations are bold and expressive, and the orchestral songs and remixes are all brilliant. The sparkling, explosions, and all the other sound effects really help bring everything together.</p>
<p>So, in case you case you couldn't tell, I think that Kirby Air Riders is shaping up to be really great. I had a really nice time racing with others and the controls feel extremely natural and easy to learn. Kirby is having a heck of a year on Switch 2, I can't wait to see more of this game when it launches on 20th November 2025.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NatetheHate">YouTube and podcaster 'Nate the Hate'</a>, who has already been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/rumour-gamecube-revival-planned-for-nintendo-switch-online">linked to some other rumours this generation</a>, "Starfield is planned for release on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026".</p>
<p>This follows the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> for the Switch 2 during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-every-switch-1-and-2-announcement-and-trailer">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. Here's exactly what the source had to say (<a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027">via social media</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle won't be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p>See that planet? You can go there.</p>
<p>Aside from landing on PS5... Starfield is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Bethesda and its developers are now under the control of Microsoft and Xbox, games from its teams are still expected to show up on other platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Xbox's leadership have also reiterated how they intend to bring more of games to more platforms going forward. This includes series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a>, which is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">apparently making a return</a> to Nintendo's devices in the future.</p>
