<p>What’s next for <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>? It seems to be the big question scratching everyone’s heads this year.</p>
<p>2026 is still a blank Sheikah Slate. Now that the Switch 2 console is in full swing and the Era of the Wild seems to be finally riding off into the Gerudo sunset, we’re truly in uncharted territory. We know there will be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film">Legend of Zelda movie</a> coming in 2027, but other than that, we’re just about as blind as a wayward Keese in a snowstorm on Snowhead. Who knows what’s going to happen in the first main, non-Partner Nintendo Direct for 2026, or if there will even be a Zelda game revealed in the coming months.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2iltkgz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Fortunately, the legendary staff behind the series isn’t lost by any means. They know what they’re doing, and they’ve left us a mysterious but important clue behind. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">In an interview with 4Gamer</a> and the Koei Tecmo development team, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma shared that an enormous amount of inspiration took place when they co-developed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a> with Koei Tecmo and their new AAA Studio staff.</p>
<p>"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is the first Zelda title for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to be the first to do so,” Aonuma laughed, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/zelda-producer-aonuma-inspirations-for-next-game/">according to TheGamer's translation</a>. “However, the inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the [next] Zelda we create. Please imagine this while playing Age of Imprisonment, and look forward to our Zelda.”</p>
<h2>But it’s not Imprisonment for you</h2>

<p>Hold on, before you groan and head for the back button in disgust, I know what you’re thinking. Many of you (not all) are a little weary of living in the Era of the Wild for almost a decade. And the last thing you want in a Zelda game is more repetitive hack and slash to boot, right?</p>
<p>That’s understandable. I’m 99.99% confident that’s not what the next Zelda will be about. I leave behind the 0.01% because, well, it’s The Legend of Zelda we’re talking about. What the Zelda team has in mind will always be mysterious to a point.</p>
<p>That said, I believe their inspiration with Age of Imprisonment in creating the next Zelda game has to do with a new narrative style. In fact, Age of Imprisonment could hold the key to solving the “Great Divide” between the old school and new school Zelda fan camps. Imagine a game in a brand new Hyrule era that finally joins the open-world and traditional Zelda formulas together into a unique cinematic interactive experience.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Allow me to explain.</p>
<h2>Think Legend of Zelda: The Video Game Movie</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26e52803511b9"><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26e52803511b9/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Sony Pictures</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s true, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> changed history. Not only did it revolutionise the open-world genre for the entire industry (looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>), it introduced full spoken voice acting into the series for the first time. This format encouraged stunning art direction and breathed life into characters like never before in a Zelda game. But there was a problem. The sheer freedom of open world movement limited the narrative potential to flashback cutscenes that the player finds scattered throughout the map, geographic lore hunting, and a creative, though somewhat disconnected final boss.</p>
<p>Its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, introduced a much stronger final boss experience with the return of Ganondorf and has plenty of geographic lore hunting, but it too was limited to cinematic flashbacks that can either elate or ruin a player’s experience depending on who you ask, what the found order was, and what the context consisted of in the player’s personal situation. Or perhaps, the scenes we do get are produced so extravagantly that we are only left wanting more.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain: they’re powerful enough to spark gigantic internet fights. That's open world for you. Do with that what you will.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>Now I arrive at Age of Imprisonment’s strongest point - the narrative.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to allow players to experience the ancient Imprisoning War firsthand and fill in the gaps left behind in Tears of the Kingdom with a staggering three hours' worth of seamless voice-acted cutscenes that surpass the limitations of Breath of the Wild, thanks to its more linear Purah Pad map format.</p>
<p>What’s fascinating is that the game isn’t completely linear. Unlike the previous Hyrule Warriors instalment, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, the battle challenges in Age of Imprisonment are incorporated into the main story with the map. There’s a lot of freedom to select battles without breaking the narrative. When you clear a certain amount of them, a story-locked milestone battle with cutscenes appears. Even the map itself interacts with you to pull you into the high-stakes tension of the Imprisoning War. You truly feel like you’re in the trenches with the characters and sharing in their blood, sweat, and tears as they push back against the Demon King’s overwhelming forces. This was intended by design.</p>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujubasashi explained that Age of Imprisonment’s “functionality and player experience came first, but even though the order may change, we put it together so that the scenario and terrain are well-rounded.”</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo director Aoyagi Kimiki further explained that Age of Imprisonment has “the appeal of a historical drama” with the Imprisoning War, an important event for Zelda fans. “We aimed to give the historical flow that was shared with us at the beginning its true form, and to create a structure that would allow players to feel that they were part of that history as they fought, as part of the Warriors experience.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="4d5f54506950b"><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4d5f54506950b/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Chelsea Reed / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Could this mean that the narrative limitations of the open-world system will finally be conquered in the next Zelda game? That we’ll not only experience full-length cinematic cutscenes that flow naturally like a traditional mainline Zelda again, but we’ll get to live and interact in a living, breathing Hyrule Castle Town and experience the thrills of massive dungeon crawling and camping under the stars in Hyrule Field, too? Perhaps an entirely interactive, cinematic universe?</p>
<p>I dare you to imagine such a feat. That seems like an impossible fantasy right now. But if the Zelda team can achieve a feat like that, it would not only revolutionise Zelda games again, it would set an entire industry trend ablaze.</p>
<p>Then again, that’s routine for the Zelda team. They have a stubborn habit of making groundbreaking history.</p>

Welcome, one and all, to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last time, we checked out Red Alarm for the Virtual Boy, which of course will be joining the launch lineup for Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics on NSO later this month. It was a surprisingly close contest, with North America just about claiming victory with 54% of the vote.</p>
<p>So, we skip ahead to today, where we'll be looking at <strong>Super Bomberman 2</strong> for the SNES. This game is now, of course, fully playable on the Switch and Switch 2 as part of the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, so we thought it wise to go back and see how the box art stacks up in each region.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ghrlyo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>US and EU designs are largely the same for this one (EU has a gold border, and that's about it), so we're going for a good ol' duel against Japan. Let battle commence!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:197105 @ 1770580668 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="067cc41eca3f3"><a title="Super Bomberman 2 - NA / EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/067cc41eca3f3/super-bomberman-2-na-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2403-super-bomberman-2">Konami / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so the Western design seems pretty standard at first glance, but it's a lovely composition nevertheless. We've got Bomberman in the extreme foreground with a load of enemies filling up the remainder of the space. There's some lovely use of colour, and you certainly can't say it isn't eye-catching.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d147762658b81"><a title="Super Bomberman 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d147762658b81/super-bomberman-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2403-super-bomberman-2">Konami / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's design is a bit more, shall we say, symmetrical. Which is good! It seems a bit busier in its composition, and again, the use of colour is simply superb.</p>

<p>Expect the following adjustments</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During Nintendo's Partner Showcase this week, Square Enix announced its new HD-2D RPG title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/square-enixs-gorgeous-hd-2d-zelda-like-the-adventures-of-elliot-launches-this-june">coming to Switch 2 this June</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, it has announced it will be making some changes to the game based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-wants-feedback-about-its-new-hd-2d-game-coming-to-switch-2">previous demo feedback</a> from players. Here are the adjustments on the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Based on the feedback from the post-play survey of the debut demo released on Nintendo Switch 2, we will be making the following adjustments."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Increase in Elliot's Movement Speed</em></li>
<li><em>New Difficulty Levels</em></li>
<li><em>Expanded Convenience Features for Magicite</em></li>
<li><em>Adjustment to Weapon Shortcut Menu Behaviour</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't already played the 'Debut Demo', you can access it from the Switch 2 eShop. Here's some additional information about what it offers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ‘Debut Demo’ is designed to give you a sense of the exploration and action you’ll experience in the game, so expect plenty of crunchy combat, spooky caves and all kinds of secrets hidden around.</p>
<p>See a crackable wall? Blow it to smithereens with a bomb and you might discover a Secret Treasure Route- a small dungeon you can explore for valuable rewards.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find a Shrine of Life - these optional challenges put your combat and traversal skills to the test. Perhaps you’ll find valuable loot like magicite or money. Always remember - this is a game that rewards the curious.</p>
<p>Or, you could follow the quest markers and delve into a deadly swamp, and the Unexplored Ruins beneath. This multi-level dungeon is full of dangers - so be sure to use everything you’ve learned to find your way through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We went hands on with The Adventures of Elliot last August. You can can read and see what we had to say about it in our previous coverage:</p>

<p>Here's what the critics think</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo is launching its Virtual Boy- Nintendo Classics digital library for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service later this month, and the previews are now in.</p>
<p>First up are our own impressions from Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s no secret that the Virtual Boy failed spectacularly when it originally launched back in 1995. As such, you might be under the impression that its games just aren’t very good. Well, not so! Virtual Boy Wario Land is an incredible 2D platformer that makes spectacular use of perspective, while Red Alarm is a solid wireframe shoot-em-up with clear Star Fox inspirations.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"I wasn’t able to try Zero Racers or D-Hopper, since neither of them will be available at launch. But the sheer fact that both will be fully playable for the first time <em>ever</em> is reason enough to celebrate. What a time to be alive."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196665 @ 1770578857 -->
<p>So, what did other critics have to say about it? Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/preview-virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-a-strange-reality/">Vooks</a>: "The Cardboard VB requires you to hold the unit to your face, offering the more comfortable option of playing the games... The plastic VB recreation is more impressive. It’s as close as you’re going to get to play a VB unit without forking out the even bigger bucks for a real VB. Playing this way means you can have a more comfortable control set up. This is the only comfortable part of the VB though. It was difficult to get to a good or realistic height on the unit where I wasn’t hunched over and having to push my face against the VB. It will be good to get some longer time with the VB once it is released, even just to have a quick dip into some Nintendo history."</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a>: "The most vital aspect of all of this: after just a few minutes, my eyes and neck began to hurt and I had to back away. I got the same feeling of being disconnected from the physical world around me and needing to re-integrate with it as soon as I was done that I normally get from using modern VR headsets. We've come so far in terms of VR tech, but for me that sense of dislocation hasn't changed at all."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/preview-new-nintendo-virtual-boy/">DualShockers</a>: "I... walked away a believer in these games, even with the understanding that 30 years ago, they didn't move the needle enough for mass adoption. Maybe I'm just a sucker for retro, arcade-y titles as I continue to age into my thirties, but I also know I won't at all be alone in this sentiment. If retro titles are your jam, there's a lot to have a good time with here."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/articles/previews/virtual-boy-switch-online/">CGMagazine</a>: "<em>Wario Land...</em> showed the most promise of the launch titles—just as it was arguably the most in-depth game on the Virtual Boy in its own time. Hopping between the 3D planes became more than a gimmick, as swinging hazards immediately illustrate; this is a legitimate platformer and a decent successor to the Game Boy games, and you’ll need to learn to pay attention to multiple planes to survive and thrive."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">IGN</a>: "I only played for about 20 minutes, but I thankfully didn’t get a headache like the original hardware’s reputation would suggest. I’m honestly not sure how long I’ll play in one sitting when my own Virtual Boy preorder shows up in a couple weeks, because even though Wario Land was fun, it’s still kind of a pain to play. The edges of the screen were tough to see when looking in the unit, and it’s not the most comfortable feeling to crane your neck to look inside. At least it’s that authentic neck pain I’ve always wanted, though."</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/03/i-played-the-virtual-boy-games-on-switch-2-and-it-was-actually-kind-of-cool">Game Informer</a>: "People speak so poorly of the 1995 model that I fully expected to immediately reject the Switch 2 version, but I came away mildly impressed. When the baseline expectation is "headache, neck pain, and nausea" but the actual experience is "huh, pretty neat," I think it's fair to say this exceeded my expectations. It's far from a perfect device, but it very well may be the best way to revisit Nintendo's worst console."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is out on the Switch 2 next month, and another pre-order bonus has now been announced for the US.</p>
<p>Trainers who pick up the Game Key-Card version or digital release from <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/205546/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fpokemon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2-digital%2FJCQ6HZQK94%3Firclickid%3D2blSyt0m7xyZToYX3QxcCS13Uku0503J4Thhyo0%26irgwc%3D1%26afsrc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DHookshot%2520Media%2520Ltd%26acampID%3D0%26mpid%3D205546%26affgroup%3D%2522Content%2522" rel="sponsored noopener">Best Buy</a> will also receive a themed tote bag. This item, valued at $9.99, appears to be different from the one offered on the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fpokemon-pokopia-tote-bag-B00980" rel="sponsored noopener">My Nintendo Store in the UK</a>. If you've already pre-ordered the game from Best Buy for $69.99, it should be added to your existing order. Here's a look:</p>

<p>This follows the reveal of an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-pre-order-bonus-revealed-north-america">in-game pre-order bonus last week (a plant)</a> for users who pre-order the game from Amazon in the US, or Best Buy in Canada. This special offer also extends to users who pick up the title from <a href="https://www.ebgames.com.au/product/nintendo-switch-2/330018-pokemon-pokopia#special-offers-modal">EB Games</a> and <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-pokopia">JB Hi-Fi</a> in Australia.</p>
