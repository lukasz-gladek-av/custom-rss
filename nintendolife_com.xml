<figure><a title="ff7 remake key cards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c85095d27f296/ff7-remake-key-cards.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SQUARE ENIX</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you're doubtless well aware at this point, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> is winging its way onto Switch 2 on 22nd January 2026, and we are super, super (add a few more supers) excited about it. Especially this writer, in fact, because he's managed to start the remake several times on other systems and has yet to actually finish it. Portable play will remedy this.</p>
<p>In the build-up to the release of the Switch 2 version of Square Enix's masterpiece, its director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has been chatting to German site <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JPGames</a> (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-understands-players-qualms-about-switch-2-game-key-cards-but-for-aaa-devs-its-a-way-to-overcome-loading-speed-limitations/">Automaton</a>) about those dreaded Game-Key Cards, and it seems he's of the opinion that they are a necessary evil, thanks to the a speed drawback with Nintendo's Switch 2 carts.</p>
<p>During the interview, Hamaguchi is quoted saying that, “Among developers, the discussion about the keycard format is perhaps a bit different to what fans maybe expect," pointing out that whilst the actual storage size of carts is important, it's the speed of loading high-end, AAA games and their huge assets that's the key issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think perhaps the biggest issue for developers, certainly for people like us who make high-end HD games, is the loading speed, because you compare that to the solid-state drive and the speed you can get from loading from that, it’s going to be inferior to that, it just has to be, that’s the way the media works, physically. So that’s the bigger issue, really, in terms of making games, making high-end games for the Switch 2, and what it allows, obviously, by doing a semi-download version of the game, you can then use the SSD and rely on that for that smoother loading. So that’s perhaps the bigger issue in terms of a developer."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hamaguchi is careful to clarify that he understands gamers' reaction to the Game-Key Card solution. "I really get where people are coming from in terms of their negativity towards it," he says, "and there are good reasons and debates to have there."</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">heard from a Star Wars Outlaws dev</a> about how the use of Game-Key Cards for that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">stellar port</a> helped with streaming assets, loading, and all of the benefits you'd expect from a faster storage and information-streaming system versus having that data transferred from a separate cart.</p>
<p>And so it would seem that, as far as Game-Key Cards go, and as much as Hamaguchi says he can sympathise with how players feel, the controversial 'physical' option will continue to be used as a necessary part of getting big Switch 2 games on store shelves.

<p>Plus, Mech Zangie-F returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ahead of her debut on <strong>15th October 2025</strong>, C. Viper gets the spotlight with a brand new gameplay trailer for Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>Available as part of the <strong>Year 3 Ultimate / Character Pass</strong>, C. Viper (or Crimson Viper) was originally introduced to the series in the 2008 entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>. She retains her signature moves such as Burning Kick, Thunder Dash, Knuckled Pursuit, and Seismic Hammer. A brand new move called Focus Force has also been introduced, allowing you to bring up a protective barrier before launching your counterattack.</p>
<p>In addition to her standard outfit, C. Viper will also boast her Street Fighter IV attire for those who want to inject a bit of nostalgia into their gaming. As for the new outfit, Capcom has provided two pieces of artwork in its recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/544495527868235881">blog</a> to give you a good glimpse at Viper in all her glory.</p>
<figure><a title="C. Viper 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c38f7ff28d0b/c-viper-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In addition to a brand new character, the Year 3 Pass also introduces an extra outfit for Zangief. This is based directly on Mech Zangie-F from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/marvel_super_heroes_vs_street_fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a>, though its overall design has been updated accordingly for this new release. It looks pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The additional outfit will be available on 15th October alongside C. Viper, but that's not all. Owners of the Year 3 Pass can also look forward to two addition characters in the coming months: Alex and Ingrid.</p>

<p>Ready for your Asterism Voyage?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Dragami Games has announced that its mecha strategy title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> will launch for Switch 2 on <strong>25th September</strong>. By Jove, that's today!</p>
<p>Relayer Advanced, which sees you assume the role of Starchildren in a battle against the alien Relayer, has already seen release on various other platforms since its debut back in 2022, and this snazzy new Switch 2 version comes complete with all previously released DLC and spin-off story content.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar, the 'Advanced' version is a souped-up take of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/relayer">Relayer</a> from March 2022 (the Advanced rejig launched the following October), which sits with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/relayer/">a Metascore of 77</a>. So, if you like SRPGs featuring big robots leathering chunks out of each other in space (and let's face it, who doesn't?), then it seems there's gonna be plenty of faces to get busy leathering for you.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the game's PR blurb, plus some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will command the "Stellar Gear" unit that the Starchildren board and battle against the "Relayer" forces. On stage, players will lead their troops to victory by making full use of such strategic systems as "Hate," which quantifies how easily enemies target you, "Skills" specific to jobs and characters, "Backstab," which launches pincer attacks, and "Big Bang," a special move.</p>
<p>This is the complete version that includes the main game as well as all previously released DLC.</p>
<p>Command a unit of "Stella Gear," humanoid weapons created using the technology of an ancient galactic civilization, and defend Earth from invasion by the mysterious lifeforms known as "Relayer."</p>
<p>There are a total of approximately 100 cutscenes that are played when units battle each other.</p>
<p>The stage maps are also rendered in high-quality full 3D.</p>
<p>There is also "Hate," which indicates how likely you are to be targeted by the enemy, a wide variety of skills, and special attacks such as the pincer attack "Backstab" and the special move "Big Bang."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as all of the above tweaks, the game also includes a full English dub alongside its Japanese vocals. Hooray!</p>
<p>There's no pricing on Nintendo's US site just yet, but in the UK it'll set you back £29.50.</p>
