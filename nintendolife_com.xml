<figure><a title="MK Tour - Pipe Tour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8dffb61b25e5d/mk-tour-pipe-tour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>You might well be knee-deep in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> at the moment, but if you're keen to try out a track that's currently unplayable on any mainline MK title, then you might want to get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a> downloaded pronto.</p>
<p>From <strong>9th July 2025 (today!) until 22nd July</strong>, the Pipe Tour is back for its second rerun following its introduction in 2023 and first rerun in 2024. So why is this such a big deal? Well, it's the only place you can experience <strong>Piranha Plant Pipeline</strong>, a track specially created for Mario Kart Tour that can't be played elsewhere.</p>
<p>In fact, it's the only new course from Tour that wasn't included in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, and it certainly isn't available in Mario Kart World either. So if you want to experience it, you'll need to get in on the action while the Pipe Tour is in session.</p>
<p>Mario Kart Tour ceased introducing new content in 2023 following the Anniversary Tour. All subsequent tours, including the current Pipe Tour, recycle previous content.</p>

<p><em>Big thanks goes to community member Grumblevolcano for bringing this to our attention. Let us know with a comment if you plan on diving back in Mario Kart World to experience Piranha Plant Pipeline.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

<p>Update today</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Clubhouse Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d929e42bbd22/clubhouse-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo rolled out multiple free Switch 2 game updates for select Switch games last month and one of them was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this same title has been updated again, this time with a patch to make the overall gameplay experience more enjoyable and resolve some issues. If we find out about anything going on behind the scenes, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released July 8, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Note: Update data that supports the above content has also been distributed for “Clubhouse Games: Guest Pass” as Ver. 2.0.1d.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Again, this follows a major Version 2.0.0 update which added features to this title like GameShare - allowing you to play 34 kinds of games with up to four players. This also follows an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> last week.</p>
