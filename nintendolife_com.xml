<p>We've got some exciting news for fighting game fans this week. Edia is teaming up with Takara Tomy to revive the 3D fighting game series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> on modern platforms.</p>
<p>This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/battle_arena_toshinden"></a><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a></strong> (1995), <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden_2">Battle Arena Toshinden 2</a></strong> (1995), and <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden_3">Battle Arena Toshinden 3</a></strong> (1996). The aim is to release ports of these titles between "fiscal [year] 2026 and 2027". Here's the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will begin developing ports of contracted titles for current consoles, aiming for release between fiscal 2026 and 2027. We will utilize our accumulated know-how in porting and commercializing retro games to advance product planning, aiming to create products that will not only be ports but also be enjoyed by many fans. Further details regarding the product lineup will be announced as they are decided."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>No platforms have been revealed just yet, but Edia is the same company behind crowdfunded revivals and Switch releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/valis_the_fantasm_soldier_collection">Valis: The Fantasm Soldier</a>.</p>
<p>Battle Arena Toshinden first started on the PlayStation in 1995, around the same time as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken</a> series, and is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary. As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/the-battle-arena-toshinden-trilogy-is-coming-to-modern-platforms"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlight, there was even a <a href="https://youtu.be/a8pxUyuwrW4?t=118">2D Game Boy release</a> in 1996</p>

<p>Welcome back, New Super Mario Bros.</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="f30afac8b55dc"><a title="New Super Mario Bros. DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f30afac8b55dc/new-super-mario-bros-ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch Online mobile app <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> has been updated with another Super Mario-themed soundtrack.</p>
<p>This time, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> album from the DS generation. This platformer was originally released in 2006, and the update today features "all tracks" from this title. This includes <strong>60 tracks</strong> in total, with a runtime of 1 hour and 20 minutes.</p>

<p>To listen to this music on this app, you first need to have either the Android or iOS version of the app, and you'll also be required to have an active Switch Online membership. Some of the existing DS albums available on the Nintendo Music service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/nintendogs">Nintendogs</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/tomodachi_collection">Tomodachi Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from these weekly updates to the Nintendo Music app, Nintendo has also been updating its digital retro libraries. Later this week, on 30th October 2025, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> game will be joining the GameCube's Nintendo Classics library. This game's soundtrack was also added to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-music-adds-luigis-spooky-gamecube-soundtrack-heres-every-song-included">Nintendo Music service earlier this year</a>.</p>
