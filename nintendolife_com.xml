And, according to Takuto Edagawa, the game's director, it sounds like we'll be spending a <em>lot</em> of time rebuilding this abandoned island with our Pokémon.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">IGN</a>, Edagawa — who works at Koei Tecmo and previously worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> and directed the <strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts</a> — said that the main aim of the game "is typically not to go to the end roll", meaning the credits.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fqsmtoz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it'll be about <strong>20 to 40 hours</strong>, but it would really depend on how the players play the game", he told the outlet.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like a pretty chunky game, even if you just focus on the main stuff. And for reference, the Dragon Quest Builders games, which Pokopia seems to be closely-aligned with, are a little longer at 40-50+ hours.</p>
<p>And, as you probably expect from a game like Pokopia, there's a <em>lot</em> more to do than just "roll credits", which Edagawa confirms: "There's more things to experience after the end roll... I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game."</p>

<p>Unsurprising stuff, but that confirms we'll be booking out our March to sit down and thoroughly dedicate ourselves to island rebuilding and repopulating.</p>
<p>When our very own Ollie Reynolds got to play Pokopia, he came away extremely surprised and impressed, and for cosy gamers, he had this to say: "I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p>

<p>4K puzzling awaits</p>

<figure data-uuid="c1f0558e8cf02"><a title="Braid: Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1f0558e8cf02/braid-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Thekla</em></figcaption></figure><p>If, on a random Wednesday afternoon, you were considering picking up or replaying Braid on your Switch,then we've got good news for you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/braid_anniversary_edition">Braid: Anniversary Edition</a> has received a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and it's out today.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/braid-anniversary-edition-just-got-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition/">Nintendo Everything</a>, at the time of writing, the game is available on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000117066">the Japanese eShop</a>, with other territories surely following suit very soon. It costs 3,169 yen for the game, or 475 yen to upgrade, so expect to pay a little extra for the Switch 2 magic when it hits the eShop in your region.</p>
<p>So, what does the Switch 2 Edition bring to Braid? 120fps gameplay (if your TV supports it), even more developer commentary, and 1080p handheld and 4K docked resolution. Very nice.</p>
<p>If you've never played Braid before, the critically-acclaimed puzzler came to Switch back in 2024 as an enhanced rerelease of the 2008 indie classic. The Anniversary Edition features lovely painted pixel art, additional challenges, and developer commentary.</p>
<p>The game's creator, Jonathan Blow, spoke about the rerelease's sales just a few months after it launched, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/braid-anniversary-edition-sales-have-been-utterly-terrible-says-creator">calling them "utterly terrible"</a>. Perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will give the numbers a boost.</p>
<p>His next game, <strong>Order of the Sinking Star</strong>, is coming to PC sometime in 2026.</p>
