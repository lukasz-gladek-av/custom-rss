<figure><a title="JSAUX All-In-One Carry Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5356c1cb675a6/jsaux-all-in-one-carry-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many folks, a basic case — much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">Nintendo’s own official offering</a> — to house the Switch 2 in its handheld configuration will likely be enough for general day-to-day use. But for instances in which you might need to haul everything from the dock to the Pro Controller out and about, an ‘all-in-one’ option might be preferable.</p>
<p>Nintendo offers its own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-gives-us-a-closer-look-at-switch-2s-all-in-one-carrying-case">all-in-one case</a>, but at <strong>£64.99 / $84.99</strong>, its price might be a little hard to stomach. JSAUX undercuts this significantly with its own variant priced at <strong>£29.99 / $37.99</strong>, and considering how much you’re saving here, it’s genuinely difficult to find much to fault.</p>

<p>JSAUX’s case contains two main compartments separated by two dual zips. The one at the top houses your Switch 2, with ten slots available for your cartridges underneath, and a velcro strap to keep your console nice and secure. The bottom compartment is for everything else: your dock, Pro Controller, cables, Joy-Con grip – basically everything you might consider ‘the essentials’.</p>
<p>By default, the lower compartment is separated into sections, with two larger slots in the centre, and one smaller section on each side. What became immediately apparent, however, is that the dividers separating the sections are held together by velcro.</p>
<p>Hold up now, that’s a good thing! It means you can essentially customise the way in which you store your Switch 2 accessories if you’re not quite happy with the default setup.</p>

<p>Granted, there are only so many ways in which the sections actually fit together, but if you have an accessory that’s of particularly high value, then you can always just alter the dividers slightly so that it fits a bit more snugly, preventing excessive movement when you’re carrying it around.</p>
<p>Even if you do happen to drop this thing, though, you’re unlikely to damage anything. The larger flat surfaces only cave ever-so-slightly under pressure, and the corners in particular are absolutely rock solid. You could probably chuck this thing down a flight of stairs and it wouldn’t harm the case itself or anything contained within. I still wouldn’t recommend doing so, of course, but accidents happen, y’know?</p>

<p>Hopefully you won’t be dropping anything, mind you, since the case comes with its own handle. Alternatively, you could opt for the shoulder strap. Naturally, its length is adjustable, so you can have it so that the case hangs just low enough for you to keep it secure with your hand or forearm. As a bonus, the case itself is also scratch resistant and water resistant, so no worries if you're out in the rain or if you happen to have a particularly feisty cat skulking around.</p>
<p>If you’re after something robust, yet affordable, JSAUX’s all-in-one case ticks all the right boxes. If I had to find something to nitpick, I’d say that it’s lacking a bit of visual flair; nothing much is needed here, but I do like how the official case from Nintendo has those coloured zip rings, for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you probably don’t want something that’s going to draw attention when you’re lugging this around a busy train station, or something.</p>

<p>Here's the official rundown</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a> is back next week in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a>, and ahead of the big launch, the game's Japanese website has shared an official comparison chart.</p>
<p>It shows how the game will perform and look on the Switch and Switch 2. So here's what you can expect for both platforms in terms of the quality and performance modes:</p>
<h3><strong>Switch 2:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Resolution &amp; Frame Rate (Quality priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV Mode: 3840 x 2160p</li>
<li>Handheld Mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>"Maximum" 30fps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution &amp; Frame Rate (Frame rate priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV Mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>Handheld Mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>60fps</li>
</ul>
<h3>Switch</h3>
<p><strong>Resolution &amp; Frame Rate (Quality priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>Handheld Mode: 1280 x 720p</li>
<li>"Maximum" 30fps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution &amp; Frame Rate (Frame rate priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV mode: 1440 x 810p</li>
<li>Handheld Mode: 1024 x 576</li>
<li>30fps</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>According to the same official chart, the Nintendo versions of the game will require approximately 6.3GB of space.</p>
<p>This same webpage also notes how an upgrade from the Switch to Switch 2 version of this title is "not supported". Save data also can't be transferred from Switch to Switch 2, and additional content for the Switch version can't be used with the Switch 2 software.</p>

What's that floating like a flotsam-y life raft on the surface? Why, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>. Grab on!</p>
<p>Yes, it's time for our monthly letters page feature. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Not a huge selection this month - presumably you've all been busy playing the video games. So, let's dry these few missives in the sun and get reading, shall we?</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - September 2025</h2>
<h3>"frightfully confusing" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo variable pricing for Switch 1 and 2 games is becoming a frightfully confusing situation. Let's run down some costs here first of all for physical games:</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 (switch 2 version): £58.99 RRP<br>
Metroid Prime 4 (switch 1 version): £49.99 RRP<br>
Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Switch 2): £66.99 RRP<br>
Mario Galaxy 1+2 (Switch 1): £58.99 RRP</p>
<p>So... How on earth is the SWITCH 2 version of Metroid Prime 4, a game that took 8 years of development and is clearly one of Nintendo's most expensive projects, the same price as ports of two old Wii Mario games for Switch 1?</p>
<p>I have actually managed via a third party seller to acquire a Metroid Prime 4, Switch 2 version pre-order for £48.85. That is insane value, and yet Nintendo are charging through the roof for what can only be objectively described as a less significant gaming experience.</p>
<p>When Bill Trinnen said variable pricing was based on the overall experience and value proposition, I'm sorry but, absolute porkies Bill. This situation belies any logic and I cannot get my head around it. Please understand? How Bill, How!?<br>
<strong><em>YoshiTails</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting aside the fact that nobody knows yet if Prime 4 is "insane value" at that price, Nintendo charges what they think people will pay, end of. Bill's being a bit vague, but he's not telling porkies. Nintendo looks at the Galaxy bundle and sees not a pair of polished-up ports pushed out on an ageing console, but two 10/10 all-timers (and they've got the review scores to prove it) brought together in a convenient package. An "objectively...less significant gaming experience" it is not.</p>
<p>The price tag stings for you and me — people who paid and played these games years ago — but millions of people <em>will</em> pay £58.99 and be over the moon with them. And the rest of us? Maybe we’ll pick up Galaxy 2 down the road.</p>
<p>As for Metroid, the series is growing, but it's not in Mario's league sales-wise. If they want to sell decent numbers (to people beyond Metroid devotees who would pay $90 if they <em>had</em> to), 60 quid is a reasonable ask - the value-proposition sweet spot for that game, by Nintendo's judgement.</p>
<p>And Nintendo would never (publicly) use dev time and the associated costs to justify higher price points because it would bite them in the ass when ‘Mario Party Boogaloo’ arrives in 12 months' time and everyone starts complaining it isn't $40. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"I want to vet"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the big problems with Shovelware is it makes new game discovery almost impossible. Back in the DSi games, I would occasionally download random games that just sounded kind of fun and discovered a lot of real gems this way. Today, I find myself scrolling through the weekly Nintendo Download section you fine people provide and I sometimes see a title that looks like it might be fun, but I'm afraid to get burned by some false-advertising shovelware game. This means that there are probably some real indie gems out there that are getting overlooked.</p>
<p>My question: Since Nintendo doesn't seem to be in a rush to fix this issue, what steps should I take when I want to vet a new, fun-sounding game to see if it's legit? What are the tells that you're going to get a piece of shovelware garbage?<br>
<strong>Pak-Man</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We covered how to avoid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-rise-of-scam-games-and-keyword-bingo-firms-flooding-switch-eshop">'keyword bingo' and 'scam' games</a> a while ago, so check out that article if you missed it. Generally, though, those are fairly easy to spot - and that goes for the AI-slop and rubbish that outfits like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Aaldora">Aldora</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Apakotime">Pakotime</a> pump out weekly.</p>
<p>I get the sense you mean games which might look like a Downwell or a VVVVVV or a [insert brilliant pixel-art game here] from the outside but turn out to be low-effort rubbish? Most games that look like Vampire Survivors are <em>not</em> Vampire Survivors! I understand the predicament.</p>
<p>It's still quite rare, though, to find a good game with literally zero positivity <em>somewhere</em> on the internet. If you've run out of bona fide classics in your backlog and want to get adventurous or catch up on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/reader-recommendations">gems you missed</a>, I'd make sure to find a clip of the game running at least. Seeing it in motion will filter out plenty.</p>
<p>And the rest? That uncertainty is part of the thrill, I suppose! I don't remember the last time I bought a game on a whim without knowing exactly what it was. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"nerf yourself"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendo Life,</p>
<p>A big part of the Donkey Kong series is the amazing boss battles, so I was disappointed with the lack of difficulty in Donkey Kong Bananza. I know that a counterargument is that if you want more difficulty, you should use less hearts and recovery items, but I don’t find it fun to “nerf” yourself. That’s like saying “If you think Super Mario Bros. is too easy, you should play it blindfolded.” In his YouTube channel, Sakurai discussed the importance of “risk and reward,” so not only should games have options for difficulty, but games should encourage players to go for the highest difficulty that they can handle. I feel that a good example of this in a platformer is Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair—not only did that game have customizable difficulty, but it had an in-game reward system that encouraged you to go for higher difficulty. I just find it sad that more and more games are giving out rewards with no risk. Back in my day, games weren’t afraid to challenge you. And, by gum, we liked it!<br>
Oh dear. I’ve become Cranky Kong.<br>
<strong>-Anonymous</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know, I hit a wall with the final boss and still haven't been back because I got distracted by banandium when I went back to the higher levels.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty discourse around Silksong wound me up (though not quite as much as 'Silksong's too cheap!'), although I get it — who's got the time we had back in the day to spend a whole summer beating one incredibly difficult game? I also get not wanting to self-nerf.</p>
<p>More intelligently implemented options around difficulty are a good thing in my book. Nintendo often errs on the cautious side with its trad-style, three-hit-kill Mario and Zelda bosses, but I don't come to those games looking for friction or mountain to summit. <em>Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"the same guy"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello hello! It's the same guy who went on a tirade last month about Blaster Master Zero being underrated! (I hope I got a few new believers).</p>
<p>I did end up giving Just Shaped and Beats a whirl per your recommendations and you know what? I'm a fan. What you see is what you get, it's no nonsense, the beats are beautiful, it's addicting, and there are two connections to Mega Man. Sort of.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>A track by Bossfight features in the game. Bossfight also did a stellar remix of Wily Stage 1 from Mega Man 2 (even a live performance!). And the track Yokuman Stage? Lifted straight from the fangame Mega Man Unlimited.</p>
<p>That's enough rambling from me though, have a great day/night.</p>
<p>P.S. Silksong coming out is challenging Shinobi: Art of Vengeance as my Game of the Year and it hurts the Sega child in me.<br>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>
