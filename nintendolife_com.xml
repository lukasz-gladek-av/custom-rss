<figure data-uuid="4e70039ba7b4f"><a title="GameCube Grip Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e70039ba7b4f/gamecube-grip-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo launched its dedicated GameCube NSO pad alongside the Switch 2 last year, undoubtedly providing the best experience for docked play. However, much like the N64 pad before it, the controller doesn't do much to help with handheld play, where the Joy-Con 2 button layouts simply can't capture the <em>feel</em> of the original hardware.</p>
<p>Enter abxylute's N9C, a Switch 2 grip that launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/abxylute-n9-n6-full-size-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2?ref=7yzisn">Kickstarter</a> today and was almost immediately fully funded, which looks as close as we'll ever get to a GameCube pad built for handheld play.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/crkd-nitro-deck-for-nintendo-switch-almost-great-but-with-one-major-flaw">CRKD's Nitro Deck range</a>, this is a grip that sits around the Switch 2 screen, substituting the usual Joy-Con placement for one half of the 'split' pad. It attaches via the console's bottom USB-C port to keep the button inputs super snappy, boasts swappable joystick gates for both 8-way and circular options, supports gyro controls <em>and</em> has four extra buttons on the back for you to remap as you please.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, it nails the look of the GameCube pad. Sure, anything in that shade of purple is bound to bring the nostalgia, and the d-pad and stick tops are a <em>little</em> off from the original design (if we're really being picky), but it's difficult to knock that face button placement when we start to think about the prospect of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> on the go.</p>

<p>If those violet tones are enough of a throwback for you, and you can do away with the GC's asymmetrical button layout, abxylute is also launching its N6 grip for a slightly more conventional look. This one packs in hall-effect joysticks, front-facing speakers, remappable buttons, gyro support and more. It might not be quite as nostalgic as the N9C offering, but it certainly looks comfier for extended handheld play sessions than the standard Joy-Con setup.</p>
<p>This one comes in either black or purple colourways, so you can choose how much of a throwback you want.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, both grips are only up for Kickstarter support at the time of writing, though early backers will have access to "a Super Early Bird price before full retail availability". You can pledge $618 HKD (around £59 / $79) for one of the N6 grips with an expected April 2026 delivery, or $696 HKD (roughly £66 / $89) for a N9C unit with an estimated June delivery during this early period</p>

<figure data-uuid="44c983db61caa"><a title="Goodnight Universe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44c983db61caa/goodnight-universe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Skybound Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>We really liked <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a>, Nice Dream's follow-up to GoodbyeWorld's award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/before_your_eyes">Before Your Eyes</a>. But for the Switch 2 version, there was one big thing absent that players on Steam had — camera support. Eye-tracking and facial recognition is a big part of the game, but with the feature missing at launch on the hybrid console, we just had to be patient.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for those of you who have been holding off or who have been dying to replay the game as-intended, camera support is finally here! So, as long as you have the Switch 2 version of the game and a compatible USB camera (or the official one), then you're game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8gqsvyr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Accompanied by a cute little visual to show you the best way to set up the camera for optimal eye-tracking magic, today's update also includes a little visual fidelity boost for the newest console.</p>
<p>As for setting the camera up, publisher Skybound Games recommends you play using this method in a well-lite space, with the camera positioned around 18-24 inches in front of you, with your face fully visible. You'll be able to test this all in-game before you start.</p>
<figure data-uuid="36eb7a64f6bbc"><a title="Goodnight Universe camera set-up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36eb7a64f6bbc/goodnight-universe-camera-set-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Skybound Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, time for us to dust the ol' Switch 2 camera off then. If you happened to miss Goodnight Universe last year, then prepare yourself for a beautiful narrative adventure.</p>
<p>The game has you control a six-month-old named Isaac — that's the age where you don't really understand <em>anything</em> and you're trying to get to grips with limbs, movement, all sorts of weird things! Oh, Isaac is <em>also</em> developing psychic powers, and a tech corporation has found out about that. So that's just an extra thing on top of everything else. Fun!</p>
<p>We scored the original release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">a 7/10 back in November 2025</a>, but even without the camera implementation, we thought the game was solid: "Isaac’s supernatural adventures are as entertaining as they are heartwarming, and though it isn't terribly long, it makes full use of every moment."</p>
