<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161927/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The way I see it, there are three different versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>. First, there’s the game as promised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKD83Z1RbR0">in the trailers</a>: a survival horror with some general emphasis on resource management and gunplay, all elevated with some nice-looking cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Sweeping cameras slowly reveal the ominous presence of creepily deformed lab creatures. Moody pans pass over entrail-covered woodlands. And emotive close-ups show dramatic angles of the lead character, Elena, as she searches for her friend, Lou, who went missing in the opening. It’s all very appealing. Throw in a high-end voice-over and some occasional '80s synths, and you’d be forgiven for thinking I Hate This Place was going to knock your <strong>Stranger Things</strong> socks off.</p>
<p>But the truth is the trailers are pretty damningly misleading, and not a second of that narrative flair has made it into the game. Instead, the story is told via some fixed-camera early-'00s-era cutscenes that brought back memories of a simpler time in gaming.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161929/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I say all of this because I Hate This Place comes with a fairly hefty price tag ($29.99 USD / £26.49), and I feel it’s important to give realistic expectations. If you were to compare the game to the trailer, what you’d see is more of an echo, a ghostly shimmer of what was being promised elsewhere.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t make I Hate This Place <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>As for versions two and three, well, the difference here belongs to that familiar old story – the late-night campfire tales of underpowered hardware struggling to run contemporary, seemingly demanding games. This here is a Switch ‘1’ game – and more often than not, it shows.</p>
<p>In fact, when I looked at some videos for other systems, I realised just <em>how much</em> I Hate This Place was suffering on the Switch. On more powerful hardware, the game looks pretty great. Elena’s torch casts accurate shadows from the legs of giant spiders. The shine of the spectral underworlds you visit to solve the mysterious origin stories of a number of ghosts looks great and suitably otherworldly and strange.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161931/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Switch, however, I was often distracted by visual ticks during my six-hour playthrough. Elena’s shoes sometimes clipped through textures on the floor. Cutscenes suddenly jumped back to earlier moments in the story – or ended inexplicably short. Often, ghosts disappeared instantly as if someone had forgotten to add an effect.</p>
<p>I could go on complaining, but here’s the twist: despite the lack of finesse, I had a pretty good time. For me, too many of the big releases of the last year have felt as if they were going through the motions – but with I Hate This Place, I at least felt as if developers Rock Square Thunder were reaching for the sky.</p>
<p>The core gameplay — the twin-stick shooting and combat — won me over quickly. Sneaking around, creeping past monsters, and crafting new weapons and bombs to deal with any that got too close was fun. I soon found an enjoyable balance between being cautious and gung-ho. I enjoyed throwing Molotov cocktails at mutated creatures, watching them burn, and then picking them off with a few rounds of my newly crafted rifle.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161926/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether exploring swamps or mines, the challenge felt well judged, and each section lasted just long enough. The story — loosely based on a comic series about a haunted ranch and its surrounding wilderness — does a lot of heavy lifting. It grabbed my attention early on and showed enough creativity to win me over some more.</p>
<p>Less positively, though, in larger areas the performance often fell apart, dropping to a hauntingly low couple of frames per second. Some players will find this unforgivable, but for those like me who spent the best part of the last 10 years playing compromised ports, I coped with these moments well enough. Maybe that’s a testament again to the fun gameplay.</p>
<p>The last misleading element of the trailer concerns the crafting and the building. I’ve read some takes in the last few days that painted these crafting elements as more than they are, because in truth they’re very underdeveloped – seemingly remnants of ideas that had to be canned or simplified for whatever reason. For me, crafting more bullets, upgrading a weapon or two, and keeping bandages stocked was all I ever needed, and as someone not that bothered by exhaustive resource management, I was okay with that.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161933/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I can’t give I Hate This Place a higher score than the one below. The technical issues and a lack of finesse haunt almost every nook and cranny of its game world. But I also want to stress again that it’s often very fun, too. It’s not one I’d recommend full price on Switch, but if you can tolerate uneven performance and you enjoy scrappy, experimental survival shooters, there’s something here worth playing.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I Hate This Place is a game that oversells itself in the trailer and undershoots on the Switch, but still manages to be very enjoyable. The performance issues, visual compromises, and pared‑back crafting leave their mark on much of the experience, yet the core loop of sneaking, crafting, and blasting through strange supernatural threats has enough bite to carry it.</p>
<p>When the action flows, it’s easy to see what the developers were aiming for. It just depends on whether you’re willing to look past the rough edges to enjoy what <em>does</em> work.</p></section>

<p>Lego's new Pokémon sets are right around the corner, launching on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, A.K.A. Pokémon Day.</p>
<p>If you're a little unsure as to whether these sets are right for you, Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has recently got his hands on every available product, including Eevee, Pikachu, and Charizard/Venusaur/Blastoise.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, we also get a good look at the pre-order bonus Kanto Badge set, and the Lego Insiders Mini Pokémon Center set. There are other videos available online for each individual set, but this is one gives us a glimpse at all of them in one go – nice.</p>
<p>It's a pretty decent showcase of the new sets, overall. For example, we're pretty confident that the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fpikachu-and-poke-ball-72152&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">PIkachu</a> set (£179.99 / $199.99) just isn't for us – it just looks a bit weird, don't you think? <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fvenusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">The Starter Evolutions</a> looks pretty incredible, but you'd expect that for the ludicrous price of £579.99 / $649.99, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Feevee-72151&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Eevee</a> looks okay though, and at £54.99 / $59.99, it's definitely on the more affordable end of the scale. Though to be honest, referring to any Lego set as "affordable" is probably a bit of a stretch these days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also pre-order the new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Focarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle</a> set right now for £99.99. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/video-get-a-closer-look-at-legos-new-zelda-ocarina-of-time-set-in-this-first-review">Tiago Catarino also got his hands on this set recently</a>, and we have to admit, it looks pretty sweet.</p>

<figure data-uuid="7d3a145cddbe0"><a title="Black Flag" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d3a145cddbe0/black-flag.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>A curious new listing for an <strong>Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster art book</strong> has appeared on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=nlife-21&amp;ascsubtag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon UK</a> in what may be the clearest indication yet that Ubisoft is gearing up to release an updated version of its swashbuckling classic.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, the listing states that the book is scheduled for launch on <strong>24th March 2026</strong> and is being published by Titan. Its price is currently £29.95, a 25% reduction on its £39.99 RRP. There are few additional details at this stage, and even the use of the word 'Remaster' is seemingly at odds with the '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced">Resynced</a>' moniker we've been hearing for a while now.</p>
<p>Still, this definitely seems to be a thing, and is yet another indication that a reveal may be imminent... sort of. A lot of things are up in the air at the moment since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">Ubisoft announced major restructuring</a> at the company. Seven games currently in development have been delayed, so it's unclear if Resynced is included in the lineup.</p>
<p>We should hear more from Ubisoft later today regarding its plans when it releases its Q3 financial report, so we'll be sure to update you on that as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Black Flag Resynced has already been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-has-been-rated-by-pegi">rated by PEGI</a>, while its main star, actor Matt Ryan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-actor-drops-the-biggest-remake-hint-yet">dropped a major hint</a> while speaking with a fan, stating "you may have to beat it again".</p>

<p>As described in the official patch notes (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-today-2-4-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the new widget is a "compact size equivalent to four icons", so it's not going to take up a massive chunk of space on your home screen. Naturally, all you need to do is update the app via the Play Store/App Store, and you'll be good to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added a new size to the calendar widget.<br>
- We’ve added a compact size equivalent to four icons to the daily rotating calendar widgets featuring various characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong>Tomodachi Life</strong> can now be selected as a game series you're interested in. To do this, navigate to your account settings screen on the bottom right, tap on 'Home', then 'Your Favourite Characters/Game Series'.</p>
<p>With the impending release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>, this might be a good way to keep up to date on minor announcements or videos. Of course, we'll be covering any larger announcements right here on Nintendo Life too.</p>

<p>Here's the exact time that Season 7 will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 10pm (Wed) PST / 11pm (Wed) MST / 12am CST / 1am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 6am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 7am CET / 8am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 5pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As ever, there are some Pokédex restrictions on which 'mon you can take into battle with you in Season 7. Just like last time, only Pokémon numbered 001-232 in the Lumiose 'dex and 001-132 in the Hyperspace 'dex will be allowed to compete, all of which will be set to level 50 for the duration of the battle. Oh yes, and you can only stick one Restricted Legendary Pokémon on your bench, too — so no super teams, okay?</p>
<p>As we say, there are still a few days of Season 6 remaining before all this kicks off. You'll find everything you need to know about the current event (and all those that came before it) in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-battles-all-seasons-and-rewards">Ranked Battle guide</a> below.</p>
