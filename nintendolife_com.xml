<p>Introducing the Detective and Viper</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Among Us" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee65c8e5c04b/among-us.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a> has received a new update (17.0.0) across all platforms today, adding two new roles to the game and various quality of life updates.</p>
<p>The new roles include the Detective and the Viper. Here are the abilities of both, along with a look:</p>
<h3>Detective<br></h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Keep track of a dead Crewmate’s location, your list of suspects, and what kind of Impostor you’re looking for.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Interrogate:</strong> Start questioning your fellow Crewmates, and find out where they were during the crime!</p>
<p>You can only use the ability on one active case at a time! You’ll need to switch the file if you’re researching multiple murders.</p>
<p>You can change how many Interrogations a Detective can do via the advanced role settings when you’re in the Dropship.</p>
<p>When we made this role, we really wanted to make Emergency Meeting discussions even more fun!</p>
<p>Be careful, though! As you start putting the pieces together, you might be the Impostor’s next target. Make sure to grab a fresh notebook and your magnifying glass — you’re gonna need ’em!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Viper</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>This new Impostor role is perfect for destroying, or in this case, dissolving their victims. Use a well-timed Sabotage to keep the rest of the crew busy while you use your <strong>Acid</strong> ability and watch the Crewmate’s body slowly melt away. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>After a kill, the Crewmate corpse will decay in 3 stages: slightly dissolved, very dissolved, and then just a bone before it’s completely gone.</p>
<p>You can adjust how quickly the corpse dissolves in the advanced role settings in the Dropship.</p>
<p>Before long, the body is gone, and all you have to worry about is your alibi. Time it right and you might achieve the ultimate Impostor dream: killing without leaving any trace of it behind. No one’s going to call an Emergency Meeting when there’s nothing, right?</p>
<p>If you find yourself on the unfortunate end of the Viper’s acidic spit, sadly… this is your end. But at least you’ll be treated to a brand new kill animation before you watch your body start to sizzle.</p>
<p>We had a great time testing these roles and are excited to see how y’all handle these new abilities — whether you become The Skeld’s greatest detective or you just want to go around spitting at other Crewmates (a lil gross, ngl), it’s sure to be a ton of fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As for the QoL updates, players can look forward to updates to the guide settings, role settings, and an improvement to practice mode. There are various other fixes and bugs addressed in this latest update as well.</p>

<p>"It’s a pig, it’s a plane, it’s the Superman DLC"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>To celebrate the new Superman movie, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> has received some themed DLC on the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>It gives fans a chance to play as Superman, use powers like Super Strength and Heat Vision, and take down villains, all while protecting Metropolis. You'll also be able to fly to the Fortress of Solitude to "hang out with Kypto".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this DLC, Lex Luthor is opening a shelter for lost puppies, providing food, shelter, and love. HA! Of course, that’s not what he’s doing. No, no, no, he’s doing evil stuff, as per usual.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>More specifically, he’s orchestrating a most disturbing scheme, perhaps his most disturbing scheme yet (and there’s not a puppy in sight). But Lex is no fool, he knows that Superman constantly foils his masterplans, so to keep the cape-clad avenger (you) occupied, he’s stirring ruckus in Metropolis so that he can work in peace.</p>
<p>To unravel the mystery and save Metropolis, you'll have to swoosh through the air, punch, beam, and freeze your enemies, crack puzzles, and if you ever need any help, you can always ask <em>Daily Planet</em> intrepid reporter Lois Lane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a free Superman fan top you can redeem in the Dressing Room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Obviously, you want to flaunt and flash the classic Superman “S”, so we’re handing out a free Character Creator item – the Superman fan top! Find it in the Dressing Room and show the world whose side you’re on (NOT Lex Luthor’s!)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, Minecraft hasn't received an upgrade or anything similar for the Switch 2 (at least yet), but if we hear any updates, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

<figure><a title="Star Ocean: First Departure R" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8da7c5bb3d9b4/star-ocean-first-departure-r.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Square Enix will be releasing a physical version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_ocean_first_departure_r">Star Ocean: First Departure R</a> on the Switch with the help of Limited Run Games.</p>

<p>This RPG arrived on the Switch eShop in 2019. While we enjoy it, it's definitely showing its age. It was also followed up by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/star_ocean_the_second_story_r">Star Ocean: The Second Story R</a> in 2023.</p>
