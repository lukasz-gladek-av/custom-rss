<p>The Switch version "cannot be upgraded"</p>

<p>Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> is due out on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, and ahead of release, an official FAQ has shared an important detail.</p>
<p>It's been confirmed there's no upgrade path currently available or planned, so if you want to play it on a particular platform, you'll need to buy it on that system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can copies of the Switch version of DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake be upgraded to the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no upgrade path currently available or planned. Please buy your copy for whichever system you would like to play it on.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vglsqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the text of the image above, it's mentioned how the Switch version "cannot be upgraded" and there are "no plans for such an upgrade path in the future". Additionally, Switch 2 DLC codes for the game can only be used with the Switch 2 version (and vice versa with the Switch release and codes).</p>
<p>So, there you go â€“ if you are buying the game on the Switch with hopes of upgrading it at some point, now you know you can't do that. And keep in mind a 'Game-Key Card' release for the Switch 2 version has also been confirmed.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario 3D All-Stars" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/628c7da503aad/super-mario-3d-all-stars.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 last month, Nintendo has been busy updating many of its first-party Switch titles. This even includes an update for its "limited-time" release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a>, and following an update for the Switch 2 today, another patch is now available.</p>
<p>Much like the Version 1.1.2 update, <strong>Version 1.1.3</strong> also addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience on the hybrid system. Although there's not much revealed in the official patch notes, returning players on the new platform will hopefully have a better time with the game.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (via Nintendo's support page):</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D All-Stars: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released July 14, 2025)</h2>
<h6>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h6>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>This isn't the only Mario Switch release to receive some love on the Switch 2, with Nintendo also recently rolling out updates for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and even titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, this update to Super Mario 3D All-Stars for the Switch 2 has rolled out alongside a new system firmware update. You can find out more about this in our previous post:</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45a8eb1719156/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out another firmware update for the Switch 2 and it also happens to be the first one for the month of July.</p>
<p>According to the official patch notes on the customer support page, it resolves some fixes tied to the Parental Controls and also includes general system stability improvements, which are sure to make your system super stable. Here's the official rundown:</p>
<h3>Switch 2 - Ver. 20.2.0 (Released July 14, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed an issue where Parental Control settings were not transferred from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 in certain circumstances during a system transfer.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>It's worth mentioning how this same firmware update is now also available on the Nintendo Switch, bumping this system up to Version 20.2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ltxqqi5d4s2h">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has investigated this patch, noting how this update "fixes some problems with Switch 1 backwards compatibility" including being able to "personally confirm" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal 2</a> "no longer crashes" after updating to the latest firmware.</p>
<p>The same source encourages Switch 2 owners to try out any games they were having issues with, to see if the experience has changed after this latest update.

<p>"Announcements are coming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22299e6f9294c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you've likely seen by now, there's a new rumour from the latest Nate the Hate podcast about a Nintendo Direct potentially taking place some time <em>after</em> the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In the same episode, the YouTuber and podcaster has touched on the subject of future third-party support for the Switch 2, and how although it might not look like there's much on the way beyond the initial announcements, there are apparently multiple developers holding back reveals (<em>possibly for Nintendo's broadcast</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo is also supposedly looking to reassure everyone that its new hybrid system is a "viable platform" for "big" third-party titles going forward. As for the announcements, they're expected to be coming from many of the major publishers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Announcements are coming... I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco and many others are just waiting. They have games they want to announce for the platform. They have a lot of support for this platform.</p>
<p>"...It's going to be a very important Direct for Nintendo, to say 'this is the third-party support we have, look at the games, they can stand up to those other systems' be it from a visual or performance standpoint, and 'we are a viable platform for you to select moving forward' to experience third-party releases."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also adds how Microsoft is still expected to be a "big supporter of the system", with Activision's title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> arriving on Switch 2 last week.</p>
<p>Of course, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> are arriving later this year as well. FromSoftware's Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> is also scheduled for next year, and last week, 2K locked in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> for the new platform following its confirmation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>
