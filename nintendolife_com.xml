However, not happy with the stunning attention to detail, dinky little game carts, and interchangeable screens that the vanilla Lego GB is rocking, one master builder has decided to bring hers to life.</p>
<p>In what's got to be some sort of record for a mod turnaround, Australian Game Boy modder and self-taught circuit-board designer <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/">Natalie the Nerd</a> has got her Lego handheld playing real GB games via real carts with nary a Raspberry Pi or other modern doodah in sight.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6spvonr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Indeed, this is the real deal, with Natalie explaining to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/790093/lego-game-boy-natalie-the-nerd">The Verge</a> that she put together a bespoke Game Boy circuit board with actual chips, and all that other stuff that goes inside these things. Magic and that.</p>

<p>Working with the "smallest screen kit on the market", the main target in this build was to get a circuit board inside the set that was smaller than the dimensions of the set itself, which she has achieved, albeit by removing one or two bricks.</p>
<p>The Game Boy's buttons, which aren't yet finished, will be set onto a bespoke PCB and, with the whole thing already wired for USB power, she says she'll release the circuit-board designs once she's done with the build, ensuring that everything can indeed be awesome for us all. Hooray!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/i-turned-the-lego-game-boy-into-a-working-game-boy-part-1/">Natalie goes into much more detail about the planning and build process on her blog</a> - we highly recommend you give it a read!</p>
<p>Now, you'll have to excuse us, we're off to build our own set. It won't play games, though, so Natalie has sort of ruined it now. Do any of you folks know how to build circuit boards?</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 is a truly amazing piece of hardware"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fd25317d921e6"><a title="FF7 Tifa" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd25317d921e6/ff7-tifa.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's no secret at this point that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> looks pretty incredible on the Switch 2. We know through the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that the console can handle some pretty graphically intensive ports, but this one really seems to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>According to director Naoki Hamaguchi via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-says-the-key-to-a-good-looking-switch-2-port-is-not-compromising-on-lighting/">Automaton</a>, making sure the lighting from the original remake was retained on Switch 2 was crucial to making the game look great. Instead, processing load from other areas were reduced to get the game running at a stable 30fps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I believe lighting is the crucial factor in terms of graphics quality and expression in this day and age."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to express gratitude that the team has become a model-case for delivering a high-end game on the Switch 2, before delivering some wisdom that other developers would do well to take on board for their own ports in the coming years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In our experience, if you just use the hardware properly, you’ll be able to deliver games at the quality players expect. All in all, my honest opinion is that Nintendo Switch 2 is a truly amazing piece of hardware.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's only a few months to go until Final Fantasy VII Remake launches on the Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. We honestly can't wait to see exactly how the game holds up on Nintendo's new hardware, and we're thrilled that Rebirth and the untitled third entry will also be following suit in the months and years to come.</p>
