<p>Beat 'em up with "Bimmy &amp; Friends"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The 2D pixel beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a> continues to add new characters, and in the "largest character update yet", it's now added four more fighters.</p>
<p>Each character in this free "<strong>Bimmy &amp; Friends DLC</strong>" brings a new face, new personality, and a new fighting style to the city - allowing players to experiment with "powerful tag-team" combos. Here's the rundown about and you can see each fighter in action in the trailer above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Armored Okada</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the Oyabun of the Okada Clan, Lady Okada faces constant discrimination from the elders. When a powerful threat emerged, the elders presented her with the sacred clan armor - a challenge disguised as support. If she triumphs, she earns their respect. If she fails, she proves them right.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>A heavyweight boxer known for his lightning-fast jabs and devastating uppercuts. Once too strong for the ring, he grew bored of rules and regulations. Seeking greater thrills, he turned to the streets, where his power and skill made him a prized asset for every gang.</p>

<p>Nintendo has this week surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade</a> fans with a Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>. There is also a paid upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<p>To celebrate the Switch 2 version, Nintendo has also revived the game's themed icons for Switch Online members. Yes, in case you missed it, there are four waves over four weeks, and the first wave is now officially live. As usual, they'll cost <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong> each, and background and borders are priced at <strong>5 Platinum Points</strong> each.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82vjxgih&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>If you haven't already pulled the trigger on the Switch 2 upgrade for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, it will cost you <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Or you can get the Switch 2 Edition for <strong><em>£</em>54.99 / $64.99</strong>. A physical release has also been confirmed and is arriving in April. Whatever you choose, expect 4K and up to 60fps in docked, and 1080p and up to 60fps in handheld.</p>
<p>Here's what we had to say about the Switch 2 Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition in our hands on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the smallest paid Switch 2 Edition yet from Nintendo, providing <em>only</em> a resolution bump (1080p handheld, 4K docked) and performance boost (a steady 60fps both handheld and docked). But it's hard not to be impressed when you see Monolith Soft's vision be fully realised on-screen. It's amazing we've never had a <strong>Xenoblade</strong> game at 60fps before this, and it's a real showcase of just how much more beautiful and smooth these worlds can look."</p>
