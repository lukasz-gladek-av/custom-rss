<p>"Unleash your inner Kong"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If a day of previews and impressions aren't enough <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> for you, how about a commercial? It's time to unleash your inner Kong.</p>
<p>Nintendo has dropped a brand new ad for the upcoming 3D platformer, incorporating the games central premises of music and smashing things up. You won't be able to stop yourself from humming the tune — or even chanting along with the actors.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself isn't anything new, but we're not complaining; there's plenty of smashing, running, and even a glimpse of DK's Bananza Transformation. This is the most love we've seen Donkey Kong get in a long while, and the wait over the next few weeks is going to be excruciating.</p>
<p>Fans in the comments are, of course, posting the lyrics to the DK Rap — that song <em>isn't</em> in this ad, but the "DK" chanting is certainly evocative of it. Also... is that a Lanky Kong reference at the end?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you missed it, we actually went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">hands-on with the game very recently</a>, and even after only a few hours, we might be in love. Nintendo also confirmed to us that the team behind the game is indeed "the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> team", so those comparisons are apt.</p>
