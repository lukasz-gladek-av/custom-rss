<p>Early-bird price expires today</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Over the coming years, we're likely to see a bunch of alternatives to the Switch 2's Joy-Con, but NYXI's new Hyperion 3 looks like it might be a solid early contender.</p>
<p>Available for pre-order now via the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">NYXI website</a>, you can currently take advantage of a 30% 'early-bird' discount, bringing the price down to <strong>£88</strong> for those in the UK. This is only valid for the remainder of the day, by which point the price will return to <strong>£125</strong>.</p>
<p>The Hyperion 3 looks to be a thoughtful evolution of its predecessor, boasting a more ergonomically-friendly design that's sure to be a bit more comfortable to grasp than Nintendo's own official offering. You've also got Hall-Effect sticks to reduce the risk of drift, micro-switch face buttons, gyro support, and wake-up support. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>Here's the official list of features from NYXI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Hall Effect Joystick (No Drift)<br>
- Micro-Switch D-Pad &amp; A/B/X/Y<br>
- Micro-Switch Trigger/Dual-stage Linear Trigger<br>
- 9-Axis Gyro on Switch<br>
- Pro Controller Mode/Handheld Mode<br>
- Wake-up &amp; Screenshot Feature<br>
- Adjustable Turbo &amp; Rumble Function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, we'll reserve full judgement until we're able to get our hands on the Hyperion 3, but on paper at least, yeah, this looks pretty neat. The regular price of £125 could be a bit of a sticking point for some, but if the features justify it, then this could be a go-to accessory for those who like to play both docked and handheld.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/were-truly-sorry-opus-prism-peak-slips-into-2026">a last-minute delay</a> towards the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/opus-prism-peak">OPUS: Prism Peak</a> — the spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/opus_echo_of_starsong_-_full_bloom_edition">Opus: Echo of Starsong</a> (a game we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/opus-echo-of-starsong-full-bloom-edition">absolutely adore</a>) — finally has a brand new release date for Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Coming out on <strong>26th March 2026</strong>, Opus: Prism Peak is a narrative puzzler where you play as a photographer who has stumbled into a strange realm. Accompanying him is a young girl who seems to understand this world you've ended up in, and the game focuses on your photography skills and the relationship between the two main characters.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer features a stunning theme song 'I Am Farewell Itself, I Am Life', composed by Kevin Penkin, the composer of anime such as <strong>Made in Abyss</strong>, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries</strong>, and <strong>Tower of God</strong>, as well as for the narrative video games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/necrobarista_final_pour">Necrobarista</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/florence">Florence</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what to expect from the game when it launches later this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong><br>
* Adventuring Together: The heart of the experience lies in the evolving relationship between the two protagonists as they navigate a landscape of spirits.<br>
* Photography as a Narrative Bridge: While exploring, use an old camera to uncover the world's mysteries. Photography is how you interact with the world and strengthen the connection between characters.<br>
* Grownup Regrets meets Shinkai Aesthetic: Experience a world that blends Makoto Shinkai’s vibrant visuals with the midlife disillusionment of Firewatch</p>
</blockquote>
