<p>The Switch title received a free update last month</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Alongside Switch 2's launch last month, Nintendo rolled out multiple free Switch game updates. One of these was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> â€“ which not only included visual optimisations but also added Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Now, timed in with this update and the game's fourth anniversary, the Game Builder Garage community has held its very own "fan-made Nintendo Direct" <a href="https://youtu.be/4XpotaYRQRY">hosted by VideoDojo on YouTube</a> (<em>thanks for the heads up, Giovani Vitti</em>).</p>
<p>It showcases 20 minutes of community-made games (and demos) available now and coming soon, and even features an entire segment dedicated to Game Builder Garage creations made by the game's community in Japan.</p>
<p>Some of the games here channel Nintendo's IP and there's even a recreation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and many other fan-made surprises. You can see just how far the community has pushed this game-maker in the full video above.</p>
<p>And here's a quick list highlighting some of these games. You can find out more about each project by scanning the QR codes displayed throughout the presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOOM: The Garage Ages</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Kirb RPG</strong></li>
<li><strong>Crumble Crew</strong></li>
<li><strong>HajiPro Direct</strong></li>
<li><strong>Printo Golfing!!!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kuno</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shackled II: Bloodbound</strong></li>
<li><strong>Undertale: Quest of the Depths</strong></li>

<figure><a title="Harvest Moon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b895a5217908/harvest-moon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Natsume</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Natsume previously announced it would be releasing a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Harvest Moon</a> double pack on the Switch at the beginning of this month, but it seems there's been a slight delay.</p>
<p>Instead of the 3rd July 2025 release, it seems farming and life simulation fans will now have to wait until <strong>31st July 2025</strong> for this game to arrive. Natsume didn't reveal the reason behind the delay but did <a href="https://x.com/Natsume_Inc/status/1939746378286039510">issue an apology on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hi, farmers. We are very sorry to share that Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley &amp; Skytree Village will now be released on July 31. We are very excited to bring these 3DS titles to the Switch and hate to make you wait. Thank you for your patience and understanding!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wzrvkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As mentioned, this two-in-one bundle will contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">The Lost Valley</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Skytree Village</a>, which originally debuted on the 3DS. These new versions on Switch will be "optimized" for the system and each game includes the DLC.</p>

<p>Part of a new event feat. Aespa</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following its Switch 2 release and the news of "five million global sales", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> has now announced its latest collab.</p>
<p>It's teaming up with the South Korean K-Pop group Aespa. Fighting fans can expect themed collab items, a limited-time Outfit 4 for Juri, and last but not least the virtual artist and idol Naevis, who will be added to the game as a new commentator.</p>
<p>These collab items will be made available across all versions of the game including the Switch 2 on <strong>4th July 2025</strong>. Juri's new outfit is available for "one year only", so get it while you can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Starting Friday, July 4, 2025, a special collaboration outfit with aespa will be released as Outfit 4 for Juri, available for one year only!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this special collaboration, the game's online Battle Hub will also be getting transformed with aespa-themed decorations. And if you log in during this event you can receive special times like new titles, device wallpapers and photo frames.</p>
<p>Last week, Capcom confirmed Sagat would also be returning in August, with his Fighting Pass content scheduled to be made available on the same date as this new collab. Capcom has also revealed its next batch of outfits, which you can take a look at in our previous coverage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Warner Bros. Animaniacs" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71c8225a059ab/warner-bros-animaniacs.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF4PqtMVTCc&amp;t=7s&amp;ab_channel=WBKids">Warner Bros.</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>If you were a kid who grew up in the '90s, you've probably watched more than a handful of episodes of <strong>Animaniacs</strong>. The Warner Bros.-produced cartoon ran from 1993 to 1998 and received well over 250 episodes. And, you can bet there were many video games out there to accompany Yakko, Wakko, and Dot's animated antics.</p>
<p>In fact, there were nine different games between the SNES and DS eras, in fact, but a tenth, long-lost one has recently been rediscovered and preserved online (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/06/nearly-complete-prototype-of-cancelled-animaniacs-gba-game-surfaces-online">Time Extension</a>!); <strong>Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics</strong>, which is now fully preserved and playable online thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://x.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173">Hidden Palace</a>, MrPinball64, and Billscat-socks.</p>
<p>The 2D platformer, which mixes in puzzle-solving elements, was originally due to launch in 2003. It would've been the first Animaniacs game on the handheld console, but production woes, an insolvency procedure at Full Fat, and lack of a new publisher meant that the project was quietly cancelled.</p>

<p>As you'd expect, Pinky and the Brain are at it again, and in their quest for world domination, they've planned to turn the Warner Bros. Water Tower into a rocket, and in-turn have hypnotised all the actors and crew members at Warner Bros. That leads the Warner Bros. siblings, who are immune to the hypnotisation, to stop the evil duo's plans and save the studio.</p>
<p>After its cancellation, Hollywood Hypnotics was essentially thought lost for years, despite numerous screenshots and box art being available to view online. And <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Animaniacs_-_Hollywood_Hypnotics">according to Hidden Palace</a>, not even the former developer knew if the game was actually finished.</p>
<p>But yes, folks, it was <em>basically</em> done, with the whole game all the way to the final boss now playable online. Some visual inconsistencies and "rough around the edges" moments aside, this is essentially the game we were meant to get over two decades ago. And you can see just how it runs in a brief gameplay video from <a href="https://youtu.be/S6EQ4aeWY9M?si=SNta7vhtaunnf10c">GreenShield</a> below!</p>

<p>Hidden Palace has also shared two early builds of another Full Fat Games release â€” <strong>Justice League: Chronicles</strong>, which did in fact get a full release.</p>
<p>All of these releases are extremely important for video game preservation, particularly the Animaniacs game, which we all thought was lost media. Credit to the fans and communities who work tirelessly to ensure these projects are not lost to time.</p>
