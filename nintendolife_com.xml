<figure><a title="Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0e093ec3bac6/elden-ring-tarnished-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all may still be waiting for an official release date, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> has finally secured a Switch 2 rating from the ESRB.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe" tabindex="-1">@necrolipe</a>, the game's official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40550/elden-ring-tarnished-edition/">ESRB listing</a> has been updated with an M ( Mature 17+) rating, noting that it contains "Blood and Gore, Language, Suggestive Themes, and Violence," <em>and</em> "in-game purchases".</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the ESRB website, which goes into the specifics behind the rating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of a character trying to retrieve a magical ring and become the Elden Lord. From a third-person perspective, players explore environments, collect items, and battle various enemies (e.g., knights, fantastical creatures) in melee combat. Players use swords, spears, axes, arrows, and magic to enemies; combat is highlighted by cries of pain, splatters of blood, and impact sounds. The game includes depictions of gore: collectible items that include severed fingers and tongues; a boss character cutting off its arm; severed arms hanging from a ceiling. During the course of the game, a humanoid monster is depicted partially nude, with scales/scars covering its breast and pelvic regions. The word “sh*t” appears in the dialogue.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is hardly all that surprising when we consider that the original Elden Ring, its Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and Nightreign all received an identical 'M' from the ratings board, but hey, it might imply that things are progressing behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The upcoming Switch 2 release wasn't specifically mentioned in the recently revealed line-up for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/bandai-namcos-summer-showcase-promises-plenty-of-switch-news-later-this-week">Bandai Namco's Summer Showcase</a>, but there's every chance that it <em>might</em> make an appearance, with a release date attached. For now, we can only dream.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/gallery-unboxing-superdeluxes-lush-switch-editions-for-radiant-silvergun-clock-tower-and-wizardry">Having already seen how excellent the company's other physical editions can be</a>, I couldn't wait to see what <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/sometimes-the-only-way-to-preserve-a-game-is-to-own-it-japanese-publisher-superdeluxe-gets-physical">Superdeluxe</a> had in store for this one, as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/the-best-castlevania-games-of-all-time">Castlevania</a> is without a doubt my favourite game series.</p>
<p>Despite the firm's connection with fellow physical publisher <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/limited-run-talks-switch-2-game-key-cards-huge-carts-and-difficult-pitches">Limited Run Games</a>, this edition is different from the one that was released (and then quickly sold out) on LRG's site.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jpmykh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This amazing collection includes a physical copy of the game (complete with a full-colour instruction manual in both Japanese and English), a trading card, a selection of art cards, a four-disc soundtrack, and a bonus "Castlevania: The Secret History of the Crescent Moon" book.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while the game is intended for the Japanese market, it plays in your system's selected language on Switch and Switch 2. <em>Phew!</em></p>

<p>This particular edition costs ¥8,980 / $62 / £45, but you'll naturally have to cover the cost of shipping from Japan.</p>
<p>"Even with the questionable inclusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania_ii_simons_quest">Simon's Quest</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/castlevania_the_adventure">Castlevania: The Adventure</a>, the 'highs' on offer are among the highest points in the entire franchise, and a Western debut for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/kid_dracula">Kid Dracula</a> is a lovely treat for retro gamers looking for something new," <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">is what we said in our 8/10 review of Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>. "As long as you’re willing to ignore the lesser titles in this package and you're not too bummed out by the omission of other classic entries, then you’re going to have a very good time with what’s left."</p>

<figure><a title="The Plucky Squire - Challenge Update" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e585a0ce5fce0/the-plucky-squire-challenge-update.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Devolver Digital</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're sure that many of you will have played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plucky_squire">The Plucky Squire</a> when it arrived on Switch last year, but did you find the whole thing a little... easy? Well, the next free update from developer All Possible Futures sounds particularly designed for you (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-too-easy-for-you-the-developer-heard-you-and-said-challenge-accepted">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>The fittingly-named 'Challenge Update' arrived on Steam last week, and will be coming to consoles "soon". As you might expect, this one is all about upping the difficulty, and it throws in two new game modes to ensure it does so. 'Challenge Mode' introduces tougher enemies and a greater level of challenge, while 'Iron Squire' leaves poor Jot with just one life and no second chances — <em>eesh</em>.</p>
<p>On top of that, the new update will add new enemy types, and make some tweaks to the retro-inspired minigames for an extra slice of, you guessed it, <em>challenge</em>.</p>
<p>All Possible Futures announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thepluckysquire.bsky.social/post/3lsjn2npg4c2d">BlueSky</a> that these additions come alongside "several other features and tweaks" in the update, including select page layout changes and the chance to fast-forward through dialogue scenes.</p>
<p>We had a perfectly pleasant time with The Plucky Squire last year, but felt that its performance let it down. From our tests, things are running substantially better on Switch 2, though some hiccups remain. Hey, the Challenge Update could be the perfect opportunity to dive back in, whenever it comes our way.</p>
