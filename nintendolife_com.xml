<p>According to <a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136">PlayForum</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5s-stellar-blade-is-reportedly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), developer Shift Up has secured a dev kit for the Switch 2 and has begun intial work for a supposed port of the game. The team has also gifted a whole bunch of Switch 2 units to its employees.</p>
<p>Shift Up itself has told PlayForum that "nothing is confirmed" regarding a potential Switch 2 release, but that it is "reviewing various possibilities internally".</p><p><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6evwsrgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The biggest question mark with all of this is whether Sony Interactive Entertainment would handle publishing duties for the Switch 2. The company is no stranger to releasing games on Nintendo hardware, having notably launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> simultaneously with its PS5 release in 2024.</p>
<p>A hypthetical launch on the Switch 2 isn't entirely out of the question, however, since Stellar Blade recently made its way to the Steam Deck to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawWWDl7FZM">positive critical reception</a>, despite its inability to maintain that 60fps sweet spot.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's vastly improved specs over its predecessor has meant that games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> run remarkably well. The former has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-cyberpunk-2077-tech-review-on-switch-2">praised by Digital Foundry</a>, with positive comparisons made to the game on Xbox Series S in particular.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes and ears open for a potential Stellar Blade launch on the Switch 2 in the coming months, and we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>It wasn't-a me</p>

<p>Oh, boy... Look, we know folks are eager to get their hands on the Switch 2, but this ain't it.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YulZM-vmg7Q">9News</a>, over 2,800 Switch 2 consoles have been stolen from a semi-truck while it was en route to a GameStop in Texas. The theft was discovered while the driver was at a Love's truck stop in Bennett, Colorado on 8th June during a routine inspection.</p>
<p>It's not, however, currently known exactly when or where the heist actually took place.</p>
<p>The total value of the consoles has been estimated at $1.4 million. Investigations are naturally still ongoing at the time of writing, so we'll just have to keep an eye on this one and see how things shake out.</p>
<p>One GameStop store recently come under fire for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">stapling receipts to Switch 2 console boxes</a>, penetrating the packaging and damaging the console's screen inside. The company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">attempted to make light of the situation</a> with an amusing social media post, but again drew criticism for having allegedly used a photo that rightly belongs to the outlet Bloomberg.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Sunshine" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f804adf8a94a5/super-mario-sunshine.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> is often regarded as a bit of an oddball entry in Nintendo's flagship platforming series. It has its fair share of jank, sure, but it's also considered to be a cult classic with fans thanks to its unique gameplay mechanics and memorable setting.</p>
<p>If you happened to be clued in to the game's initial release back in 2002, then you might recall the time when Nintendo pulled off one of the most ridiculous marketing stunts we've ever seen, and it involves pasta – <em>lots</em> of pasta.</p>
<p>Y'see, Nintendo served up a total of 3,265 pounds of so-called 'Pasta a la Mario' at San Francisco's Little Italy, effectively breaking the Guinness World Record for the largest bowl of pasta.</p>
<p>Attendees who arrived dressed as Mario or Luigi were invited to jump into the bowl of pasta and recover hidden Nintendo-themed prizes, including a rather lucrative trip to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Footage of the event has resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jusdberube.bsky.social">Justin D. Berube</a> over on Bluesky, who has had short videos of the stunt saved for decades.</p>


<p>Gross, right? Pretty funny, though.</p>
<p>If you're itching to replay Super Mario Sunshine and happened to miss out on the limited 2020 compilation <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch, you'll be pleased to know that the game is scheduled to launch on the GameCube NSO app for the Switch 2 at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>GameCube games are exclusive to the Switch 2 via the Expansion Pack subscription tier, with three games playable at launch. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>.</p>
