<p>They say history repeats itself, and right now I’m living through a redux of my own childhood gaming obsession.</p>
<p>To understand my plight, we need to rewind to 1988. I had cut my gaming teeth on a dusty Atari 2600 my dad picked up at a garage sale. I loved me some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/missile_command">Missile Command</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/warlords">Warlords</a>, but once my best friend and next-door neighbour got an NES, it was Game Over for Atari. I didn’t want an NES of my own; I <em>needed</em> it.</p>
<p>Hint-dropping became my full-time job until, lo and behold, an NES Action Set and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> appeared under the Christmas tree.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d3c7a307cc71f"><a title="Nintendo Action Set" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3c7a307cc71f/nintendo-action-set.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A modern recreation of past events — <em><span></span> Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Well, well, well, how the turntables...</strong></h2>
<p>Fast forward almost 40 years and the tables have turned. Now I’m the parent pestered by a passionate guerrilla marketer. This generation’s Nintendo fanatic is subjecting me to the same level of sustained pressure that I, no doubt, applied to my parents all those years ago. He doesn’t just want the Switch 2; he <em>needs</em> it, and with a resolve that frankly terrifies me.</p>
<p>Here’s a recent interaction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Son:</strong> Hey, Dad, did you see the reviews for Kirby Air Riders?<strong><br>
Me:</strong> No, what’d they say?<strong><br>
Son:</strong> They like it, but everyone agrees with you that it’s weird Nintendo released two racing games in six months. If we had a Switch 2, would you rather get Mario Kart World or Kirby?<strong><br>
Me:</strong> Mario Kart, I guess. But it’ll be a while before we get a Switch 2.<strong><br>
Son:</strong> True. It could be four or five years before we get a Switch 2, so we’ll see how you feel then. Thanks, Dad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interactions like this occur daily. He delivers Switch 2 news with the regularity of a weather report and the cunning of a snake - mirroring my objections, using decoy options, emphasising shared values, and deploying every other psychological trick in the preteen playbook.</p>
<p>I’m witnessing a masterclass in emotional manipulation.</p>
<h2><strong>The Holdout</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="431ff12ca8ccf"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/431ff12ca8ccf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why don’t I already own a Switch 2?</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm unconvinced by Nintendo’s latest console. I operate on logic, rational thinking, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-how-does-your-personality-affect-your-gaming">spreadsheets</a>, and the Switch 2 hasn’t passed my cold calculus. Call me a Switch 2 holdout, but I’ve weighed the scales and don’t yet see a positive value proposition.</p>
<ul>
<li>No OLED screen</li>
<li>No proper Zelda or Mario exclusives</li>
<li>Storage prices that should come with a side of lube</li>
</ul>
<p>No judgement to the millions of Switch 2 owners out there, but I can wait, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Not so, for my boy. He doesn’t care about the cost of MicroSD Express cards; he cares that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a> runs at a smooth 60fps, that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> would look great in HDR mode on the upstairs TV, and that you can use the mouse controls “on your pants!”</p>
<h2><strong>The Trojan Horse</strong></h2>
<p>Last week, my son pulled the ultimate move, and it might be the straw that breaks this proverbial donkey’s back.</p>
<p>As a birthday present for his brother-in-law, my son wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WetljuBFBBUjMEpQ6yN4FyxWQqBlEcqooM40aauZpdE/edit?usp=sharing">nine-page, 3,000-word summary</a> titled "Everything I know about the Switch 2". Ostensibly, this was a gift for his oldest sister’s husband, but in reality, I know it’s a precision-guided Trojan horse aimed directly at my wallet.</p>

<p>He casually asked if I’d proofread the paper. Of course I said yes, knowing full well it was a trap, but two pages in and I couldn’t help but admire the craftsmanship. He didn’t just itemise specs and list games; he was analysing the industrial design with the scrutiny of a structural engineer and previewing games with more brutal honesty than Ricky Gervais hosting the Golden Globes.</p>
<p>An entire page breaks down the kickstand alone, comparing it positively to those on the original Switch ("it tips EASILY") and the OLED, before waxing poetic about the Switch 2’s rubber-bottomed, 150-degree adjustable stand.</p>
<p>I found myself nodding. <em>Rubber on the bottom? My, that is practical.</em></p>
<p>His tome explicitly told me — sorry, my son-in-law — to "save your money" on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a> because “one new world and a new mode” isn’t worth 20 bucks. He also argued that buying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> would be a poor value proposition since “you don't need two racing games on your Switch.”</p>
<p>Wait, another psychological trick? He’s been gushing about Air Riders for weeks! He was arguing <em>against</em> a purchase he wanted in order to strengthen his core position. I’m telling you, the kid’s a mad genius.</p>
<h2><strong>Heart or Mind?</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="85bd4c62cbf5b"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/85bd4c62cbf5b/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As much as I’m still sceptical of the Switch 2’s value proposition, I have to admit that my son’s tactics are working. He’s presented the data. He’s acknowledged the flaws. He’s even acted as a <em>consumer advocate</em> to protect his dear old dad’s pride.</p>
<p>The effort he put into this document — analysing frame rates, first-party titles, and the rubber on the bottom of a kickstand — has me thinking that this isn't about value propositions or fiscal responsibility anymore. Rather, it's that same, powerful emotional connection I felt in 1988, staring at the 2600 and dreaming of an NES.</p>
<p>His treatise ends with a question, “Should you buy it?”</p>
<p>And his answer: “Well in my opinion, yes. But… I'm kinda biased lol so decide on the info that I've given you.”</p>
<p>Well played, son. Come Christmas morning, we’ll find out what wins: my Greek mind or my son’s Trojan heart. Then again, Santa Claus might just surprise us both.</p>

<p>Before we do that, however, let's recap what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-bionic-commando-nes">last time</a>. Celebrating the arrival of its Game Boy counterpart on NSO, we matched up three covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a> on the NES, and our favourite cover walked away with the win. The action-packed North American cover took the gold with 58% of the vote, Japan followed behind with 36% and Europe mopped up the remaining 6%.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>This week, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Prime 4</a> finally in our hands, we're throwing things back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_pinball">Metroid Prime Pinball</a>. Now, is this the best game with 'Metroid Prime' in its title? Probably not. But there's no knocking Nintendo's efforts to try something new — and, aside from Kirby and Pokémon, who's better to star in a pinball game?</p>
<p>Europe and North America opted for the same design on this one, so we have a good old match-up between East and West on our hands. Let's check 'em out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:1590 @ 1765114209 -->
<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="5d50e26799760"><a title="Metroid Prime Pinball -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d50e26799760/metroid-prime-pinball.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6557-metroid-prime-pinball">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You've got to give it to the Western cover, there's no doubting what the game has in store after looking at that design. Samus looms over the top half of the box, and a pinball table occupies the bottom. Simple. It's all a little bit subdued, opting for the metallic greys and yellows that dominated sci-fi in the mid-2000s over anything particularly eye-catching, but hey, it's Metroid Pinball, alright!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="2f586aa3aae8e"><a title="Metroid Prime Pinball -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f586aa3aae8e/metroid-prime-pinball.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6557-metroid-prime-pinball">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design has a lot of the same cues as its European counterpart, but the end result is rather different. Right from the jump, look at all of those colours! The dull greys of the other cover are overshadowed by neon lights and lasers, making the pinball table look that bit more exciting. There are also Metroids floating overhead, and nothing screams 'action pinball' quite like <em>aliens</em>.</p>
<p>Samus is a lot less prominent in this one, shrinking away into the upper right corner, but we'd say that the series' vibes are still present and correct.</p>

<p>Spot the difference</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo released a new update for the Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, bumping the racer up to Version 1.4.0.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, this is a major update, including all sorts of adjustments, changes and improvements. One highlight, in particular, is tied to the game's courses. As mentioned in the patch notes, the layout of select tracks has been changed for certain modes.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fMbSBsq-qeQ">YouTube channel 'RetroArchive'</a> has now shared a look at all these changes and redesigns in a side-by-side comparison video featuring footage of the original versions. As a point of reference, here's what's been updated according to Nintendo's official patch notes:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Version 1.4.0</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Changed the course layout of below courses for "VS Race", or "Race" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play".</em></li>
<ul>
<li><em>Race that heads from "Koopa Troopa Beach" to "DK Spaceport".</em></li>
<li><em>Race that heads from "Koopa Troopa Beach" to "Crown City".</em></li>
<li><em>Race that heads from "Koopa Troopa Beach" to "Peach Stadium".</em></li>
<li><em>Race that heads from "Whistlestop Summit" to "Koopa Troopa Beach".</em></li>
<li><em>Race that heads from "Desert Hills" to "Koopa Troopa Beach".</em></li>
<li><em>Race that heads from "DK Spaceport" to "Koopa Troopa Beach".</em></li>
<li><em>Race that heads from "Crown City" to "Koopa Troopa Beach".</em></li>
<li><em>Race that heads from "Peach Stadium" to "Koopa Troopa Beach".</em></li>
<p><em>*Changed it so that, in all races heading toward "Koopa Troopa Beach", including the above courses, you will cross the finish line after two laps once you arrive at "Koopa Troopa Beach".</em></p>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>You can see what else has changed in the latest Mario Kart World update in the patch note post here on Nintendo Life:</p>
