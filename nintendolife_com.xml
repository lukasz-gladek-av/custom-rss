<figure data-uuid="d3138bcbb383c"><a title="nes40" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3138bcbb383c/nes40.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 8BitDo</em></figcaption></figure><p>8BitDo has announced a brand new 'NES40 Collection' of products which incorporates an Ultimate 2 Bluetooth controller, 68-key Retro Keyboard, and a rather fetching Retro Cube 2 speaker.</p>
<p>The new range, which is now available to <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary">pre-order over at 8BitDo's official website</a>, certainly looks stunning, and it manages to add a few nice little touches to a line-up that stick to the look and feel of previous "Retro" offerings from the company.</p>
<p>The keyboard (which this writer is 100% getting) is Windows and Android compatible and due to release in early 2026. But it's the most expensive item in the collection; with a MRSP of <strong>$499.99</strong> it's certainly an enthusiast-level sort of deal, taking the excellent retro design from their past offerings and adding a very snazzy aluminium alloy shell, along with some lovely detailing and a fancy pouch.</p>
<p>It also comes with those super cool turbo buttons that we've been loving since we picked up our first <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-mario-teaches-typing">8Bitdo Retro Keyboard</a>.</p>

<p>The Switch 1 and 2 compatible NES40-themed Ultimate 2 controller, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">follows the company's Pro 3 Bluetooth controller</a> in including TMR joysticks and Hall effect sticks, releases on <strong>15th November 2025</strong>, and is also looking mighty slick as you can see below.</p>
<p>Set to retail at <strong>$79.99</strong>, it also comes with a bunch of changeable thumbstick pads, a keychain and a few other bits and bobs. Yeah...looking at these pics, we're probably gonna need one of these, too.</p>

<p>The final part of the collection is the Retro Cube 2, a dinky little portable speaker that's an upgraded version of its predecessor, and connects via bluetooth, 2.4G and USB. T</p>
<p>he speaker uses a D-pad design for its controls, which is rather cool, and has its very own charging dock to boot. This comes in at <strong>$49.99</strong>, and will release on 1<strong>2th December 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>The 8BitDo Collection is available to pre-order now, and you can hit up the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary">official link</a> to go grab yours if they've tickled your fancy.</p>

<p>For some trainers, one of the most difficult decisions in a new Pokémon game is your starter Pokémon pick.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, the same traditions apply, where you pick from one of three Pokémon. This time you have a choice of Chikorita (the Grass-type), Totadile (the Water-type), and Tepig (the Fire-type Pokémon).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After arriving in Lumiose, certain events will lead you to befriending a Pokémon that will become your adventuring partner, thus beginning your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. Which Pokémon will you set off on your adventure with: Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile?"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59vngimw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that the new game is available on the Switch and Switch 2, we're curious to know who you decided to add to your party in the end. Did you end up going with the same Pokémon you planned to <em>before</em> the game released, or did you go with someone else at the last minute?</p>
<p>So, vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>And just one other thing...<strong>spoiler alert</strong>...you can eventually get all three of these starter Pokémon in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but the catch is you'll have to wait until the end of the game. We'll be sharing more about this in our guide, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Now, a few more games have apparently been fixed and are now working on Nintendo's new hybrid system. This includes the RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic_ii_the_sith_lords">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a> and the third-person team-based shooter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville</a> (via Nintendo Everything).</p>
<p>The source also notes how this latest fix is an "interesting development" as it appears Switch games can be fixed for the Switch 2 at "any point". As part of this update, both titles are now also available to purchase on the Switch 2's eShop.</p>
<p>Once again, this follows a recent batch of fixes that resolved issues with games such as the free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a>. If we hear about any other Switch game updates for the Switch 2, we'll be sure to let you know. Earlier this week, Nintendo also released new game updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_2">Splatoon 2</a>, fixing issues with both titles.</p>

<p>Words of wisdom from Nintendo's legendary CEO</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="1fc9f76f433f4"><a title="Ask Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fc9f76f433f4/ask-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you never got around to reading Ask Iwata or just want an excuse to revisit it, VIZ Media has announced it's releasing an English paperback version in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>This book, edited by Hobonichi, compiles the former Nintendo president and CEO's famous interviews into a "motivational collection". Iwata touches on a range of diverse subjects, such as how success breeds resistance to change and why programmers should never say no.</p>

<p>Below is a sample of Nintendo Life's book review when the hardcover English version of Ask Iwata was released in 2021. When we find out more details about the paperback release, we'll let you know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a book that should be read by all — not just Nintendo fans, or video game fans — simply because Iwata espoused an attitude and outlook on the world that put happiness above all else, even when it was an aspiration in tough times. He wouldn't always succeed, as no-one does, but he'd keep trying. In a world that can often be cynical, his outlook is a welcome and hopeful beacon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
