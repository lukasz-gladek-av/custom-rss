<p>If you happen to be scrolling the PlayStation Store of late, you might notice a particularly familiar-looking art style in the shape of developer Wisnu Sudirman's '<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10017289">Anime Village Online</a>'. Contrary to its appearance, this is not an Animal Crossing game. That's right, we have another rip-off on our hands (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/another-suspiciously-animal-crossing-like-game-has-appeared-on-the-playstation-store/">VGC</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5svkinm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Set to be released in 2027 (though we wouldn't bet on it making it that far), Anime Village Online promises to be a "cozy life simulation game where you can create your dream village, decorate your home, and enjoy a peaceful world — all while playing solo or with friends online". It boasts such original features as the chance to "Design and expand your own charming house", "meet NPC villagers", and "Invite friends to visit your village". Is this ringing any bells?</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of those features can be mapped to just about every cosy game we can think of — and not <em>everything</em> is an Animal Crossing rip-off — but there's something about that key art which just looks <em>very</em> ninja-worthy. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YellowFlower69/">YellowFlower69</a> said as they shared the game page to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/">r/playstation</a> Reddit forum, "someone is getting sued".</p>

<p>No screenshots have been added to the PlayStation Store game page just yet, but based on that description and key art, we imagine that they'd probably have more than a little AC flavouring.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that we've seen something distinctly New Horizons-y appear on the PlayStation Store, either. Earlier this year, the similarly titled '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/random-geez-ps5-game-anime-life-sim-sure-looks-familiar">Anime Life Sim</a>' caught our eye with its all-round Animal Crossing vibe. That project ended up being a straight asset flip of the 'CozyLife: Social Sim Game' Unreal Engine template and, unsurprisingly, has since been taken down.</p>
<p>We don't know for sure whether Anime Village Online will meet the same fate (it probably will), but just make sure you aren't fooled by another one of Redd's fakes.</p>

<figure data-uuid="77adc1e2113ac"><a title="Mario galaxy credits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77adc1e2113ac/mario-galaxy-credits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, as we all know, Nintendo does like to hide fun little secrets and easter eggs within its adventures, especially when it comes to stuff like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario Galaxy</a> games.</p>
<p>You know, things like the part of Buoy Base Galaxy that looks like a Poké Ball, or Captain Olimar's S.S. Dolphin floating about in the Space Junk Galaxy. Yes, we love some clever little nods and winks.</p>
<p>However, as it turns out, not all secrets are quite so equally created. As highlighted by the excellent <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mariobrothblog.bsky.social">@MarioBrothBlog</a> (cheers for the heads-up <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/super-mario-galaxy-has-a-horribly-inefficient-secret-the-credits-are-always-loaded-in-the-background-while-you-play-which-has-the-inadvertently-heartwarming-side-effect-of-making-sure-the-platformer-always-remembers-the-nintendo-legends-who-made-it/">GamesRadar</a>), the Super Mario Galaxy games, in their original Wii forms, secretly load the entire staff credits into RAM at all times, even though...well, you only really need that to happen at the start or end, ideally.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890gzwoys&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>As you can see, the original social media post has at least found a nice way to frame this discovery (attributed to <a href="https://x.com/heyimheroic">@HEYimheroic</a>) in that it's a nice way to permanently — and constantly — honour the creators of this bona fide all-timer.</p>
<p>Supper Mario Broth goes on to provide further info through a few follow-up posts: the RAM used up by the credits being programmed in this way is around 1/400th of the entire available memory, which adds up to about one or two in-game objects.</p>
<p>It also turns other that in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> the issue was addressed by having a more efficient approach to loading, although the files <em>do</em> still load at all times regardless.</p>

<p>Given that Nintendo has got itself into a little bit of bother a few times lately with credits, and specifically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/metroid-prime-engineer-let-down-by-exclusion-of-original-credits-in-remaster">removing some of them from the likes of Metroid Prime Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/retro-staff-credits-removed-from-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-forever-entertainment-confirmed-as-devs">from Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, it's nice to see that once upon a time the original creators remained right where they should be.</p>

<p>"I'll take on all of you!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has shared a fresh trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> Year 3 Fighter Pass update on <strong>October 15th</strong>, this time shining the spotlight on the 'Mech Zangie-F' costume.</p>
<p>The character first made an appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/marvel_super_heroes_vs_street_fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a> and has since been included in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/street_fighter_iv">Street Fighter IV</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a> as an alternate costume for Zangief. The design for Street Fighter 6 is quite a bit more industrial than previous incarnations, but we're digging the overall look.</p>
<p>Of course, the main draw for the new update will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/get-your-first-proper-look-at-c-viper-gameplay-in-street-fighter-6">the new playable character C.Viper</a>. Originally introduced in Street Fighter IV, she since appeared in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultimate_marvel_vs_capcom_3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a> but skipped the fifth main Street Fighter entry as a playable fighter.</p>
<p>Her appearance comes with a brand-new look, but players will also be able to unlock a 'classic' costume of sorts that will bring back her iconic design from the fourth game.</p>
<p>In addition to C.Viper, Alex and Ingrid will also be added to the fighter roster as part of the Year 3 Fighter Pass in the coming months.</p>
