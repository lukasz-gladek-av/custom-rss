<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158761/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, you ran a little shop of horrors, dealing plants with an occult edge to the inhabitants of a mysterious dark town. Now, Bad Viking and Iceberg Interactive’s follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, takes us back to Undermere. Again, something strange is afoot. Again, you hear residents’ problems and offer up solutions from your range. Again, there’s a cat you can pat (!) who gets startled by the shop bell.</p>
<p>But this time, instead of being plant-based, the solutions are antique-based. If you enjoyed the first instalment for its puzzles and sinister aura, be sure to reach for this treasure, because it’s just as fun. (Either way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/strange-horticulture">the first game is worth playing</a>.)</p>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, you’re the apprentice of a thaumaturge (a sort of magic miracle-worker) who has left you to run his shop while he investigates peculiar goings-on. He gives you a map of Undermere and a book called 'Strange Artefacts: A guide to occult objects', the latter your bible for working out which among the oddities at your disposal will aid various customers’ misfortunes. And there are shelves on shelves of these otherworldly items: a stag carved of wood, a pendant with a moving eye, a disfigured hand. You know, your usual macabre bric-a-brac.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158760/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much of the play is listening to customers’ requests for mystical antiques. They might be caring for an ailing loved one, or setting out on a journey, or seeking a gift. They might have a particular object in mind, or they’ll just describe the situation and you need to suggest something. You deduce the required trinket by matching the description in your book with the shop’s wares. Clues can be a bit obscure but there are clever hints to help. And when you match each antique successfully, you get more clues, more puzzles. I was so consumed with this gameplay loop that I missed my (IRL) bedtime in my first play session.</p>
<p>Present the wrong antique, however, and you’ll increase a type of anti-health bar. When the meter fills up, you’ll feel ‘a deep fear has taken root’. This takes you to a dice roll minigame where you need to match symbols on dice to those on a board to diminish the fear. It’s quite fun in itself and its spiritual symbols of cats, snakes, suns, moons, etc., feel right at home with the unearthly undercurrent.</p>
<p>But the plot thickens: a customer comes in with a problem and your solution can be one of two items – here the game warns you that your choice will determine the fate of the story. These ethical quandaries arise a few times throughout, and while I won’t spoil anything, I will say I delighted in seeing the consequences of my chosen antiquity.</p>

<p>Around this time the game also opens up new areas and new ways of thinking: you need to procure new items for the store. Dialogue, letters, cards, and other paraphernalia pile on your desk, each hinting at a locale on your map where you can unearth these antiques. This ‘exploration’ doesn’t involve much visual change of scene (the store remains static), but the story unfolds through thrilling Arthur Conan Doyle-style prose.</p>
<p>In that way, the worldbuilding often functions like a visual novel: your imagination is left to fill in the blanks. These moments were when I noticed how masterful the storytelling is, always building intrigue and pulling you through, even when not much is happening on screen. It's impressive that such a rich world fits into such a tiny space.</p>
<p>As you progress, the puzzle ‘pieces’ become more scattered. I found myself cross-referencing various books and tools, and jumping in and out of item inspection. I used my own notes and screenshots to document clues, but it would’ve been nice if findings were logged somewhere in-game.</p>

<p>Having said that, I was never stuck. Whenever I’d feel lost on one puzzle, I’d put it aside and work on another. Lo and behold, the puzzles interlinked and I was able to solve both. This means things flow quite smoothly – making the game all the more addictive.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, Strange Antiquities is PC-first. Its point-and-click function longs for a mouse like Tess Sherwood longs for a Horned Shackle, because moving the cursor with the joystick is a bit of a drag. Bad Viking has added options for cursor speed to address this, though I still found the joystick a little laggy. You’d think, then, the game would be an ideal candidate for Switch 2’s mouse feature, but at this stage it’s not supported. So: good ol’ handheld is your friend here – an appropriately cosy way to play.</p>
<p>Along with cursor speed, there’s a good range of settings, such as arachnophobia mode and easy-to-read fonts (unfortunately font size is static, but your magnifying glass can embiggen it). Early Strange Horticulture fans will be excited to enable autolabelling – a blessing for those who find typing on the Switch cursed.</p>

<p>Every artefact, map, and character has been designed with intricate attention to detail – no easy feat when there are so many. The style is dark enough to maintain its arcane leanings, yet cartoonish enough that you know it won't haunt you at night. It strikes the balance of cosy-spooky (or, as my partner says, ‘kooky’). Likewise, the slow tempo and minor-key piano music is a little eerie without being disturbing in a true horror sense; no jumpscares here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, Bad Viking expands the rich world of Strange Horticulture – this time in an antique shop specialising in the occult. The puzzles are cryptic but rarely skull-cracking, forming an addictive gameplay loop: who knew hunting down magic antiques to solve customers’ conundrums could be so satisfying?</p>
<p>The whole thing is cloaked in a gripping mystery narrative, which you can influence with the right (or wrong) occult oddity. And with the possibility of multiple endings, replay value is high – at least for those of you who want to see just how much strangeness is in store.</p></section>

<figure><a title="undertale 10th anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab24f5e410d85/undertale-10th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to believe that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> is 10 years old, innit. A game that released just a year after the birth of my eldest son, and two before my youngest arrived on the scene. What is time? It's all going so quickly.</p>
<p>I bring my kids up here, not to be one of those tiresome people, but because Toby Fox's masterpiece (and you better believe that's exactly what it is) is a game that has the honour of being the first I was introduced to and drawn into entirely by the efforts of my terrible offspring.</p>
<p>Rather than the usual occurrence in our house, where I scream excitedly at them both that they simply must play the latest Very Shiny Thing™, as well as all of the classics — what kind of an education misses out on the classics? — that sit at the top of their respective genres. You know, a bit of the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario</a> to cover platforming, a shot on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_ridge_racer">Ridge Racer</a> for everything they'll ever need from a driving game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> just for the hilarious graphics patter...all that sort of stuff that dads like me need to help us through our days.</p>

<p>I've always stuck to the safe bets, trying to gently introduce my sons to things they'll get a handle on quickly and then actually enjoy so they're not put off the hobby, but this has proven to be an idiotic approach. Yes, as it turns out, funnelling your kids through stuff that's deemed cool by you, or "appropriate" for kids by the industry, is perhaps preventing them from chancing upon something that genuinely, in real time, could have a positive effect on their lives.</p>
<p>What on earth am I talking about? Well, Undertale, if you haven't played it, is the sort of game that doesn't perhaps grab your attention straight away, hence why I had totally missed it back at release. I will also admit that I still wasn't really bothered, even when I caught a glimpse of some seriously good-looking review scores. It just didn't seem like my sort of thing. What an absolute balloon animal I have been in my previous life.</p>
<p>Because now, 10 years down the line, I can't really remember a time when my eldest hasn't been either talking about Undertale, making little Undertale projects on his PC, or quoting the game in every situation he can get away with. Even more pleasingly for me, he's taken up piano and keyboard (and has been eyeing up my incredibly dusty guitar), all thanks to his love affair with this game's masterful soundtrack. Did you know Undertale has one of the greatest soundtracks in video games? No? Well, my friend, now you do. Indeed, I reckon we're looking at a top-five spot without any issues. Fight me.</p>

<p>Toby Fox's chiptune masterpiece takes in a crazy amount of influences and spins them into gamified bangers. There's acid house here, jazz, choral, hardcore breakbeat...and I know, I know, with so many influences surely the end result is some fine-but-watered-down tributes. Wrong! These songs, songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9XtKJHvjQ">Heartache</a> (the first where I was like "Okay, this actually slaps"), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAiUtWZ4xY">Bonetrousle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEbHopRL0OA">Stronger Monsters</a> (incredibly hardcore stuff) and on and on.</p>
<p>You gotta go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BR7-AzE2dQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_l6pEkEJgy577R-aDlJ3Gkp5rmlgIOu8bc">check this album out</a> if you haven't already heard it. It's important. That is a fact. It has significant cultural importance, I feel, and part of this, besides the obvious popularity of the game, is how I have watched this music positively affect and inform my children.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna talk about the story of Undertale here, it's a game I've played a bunch of times now, but always in fragments; repeated, never in order, broken up with kids' arguments or other things to do in the house. It's also something you should just go away and play and experience on your own for maximum effect without having any information relayed or spoiled. But as much as it's fully suitable, in my opinion, for kids, it also doesn't shy away from some weird, weird s***.</p>

<p>Neither does it step back from dark themes and real-life stuff. Death and all that crap. Eating too much and feeling sick afterwards. Y'know, the big things. There are lessons, lessons that stay with you — and I've watched them stay with my eldest as he'll still reference the game or a character (Sans is a constant in our house) in discussions — about violence and where it leads to, about greed, about making the right choice at the right time, about having to live with the consequences of the things you've done.</p>
<p>I mean, <em>steady on</em>, that's a bit much for the kiddies, no? Maybe take a break and play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/race_with_ryan">Race With Ryan?</a> Let's never do that.</p>
<p>As much as things can get a bit edgy at times, it's these aspects of Undertale, and especially if you are playing it with younger gamers present, that makes almost every screen a delight, because you've now got the onscreen puzzles (top tier across the board) sat alongside the real world mental puzzle of explaining things delicately to your children as they crop up. I mean, a father threatens his own son at one point in this game. How do you think that went? It's fun to learn together!</p>
<p>It's not hard to see how it's got such a cult following, considering all of this, and how it gives younger gamers so much to chew on and come back to time and again.</p>

<p>Finally, and another delightful thing, especially for a parent, is watching how much both of my kids have got into all sorts of actual messy art-attacking (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsHuNuoAfV0">hi, Neil!</a>) off the back of the unique pixel style that Toby Fox used for Undertale. These characters and situations are easy to recreate, to add to your backpack (and draw all over your mum's office).</p>
<p>It all opens doors to creativity and, alongside the music aspects, and the little life lessons we've discussed as they've played and replayed the game over the years (you better believe these guys are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> fans now, btw), Undertale has gone from something that would very definitely have passed me by, into something that has become an important, relatively speaking, part of my relationship with my kids.</p>
<p>So that's nice. Happy birthday, Undertale. I still have to use a guide to play you when my kids aren't around, and I'm not even ashamed to admit it.</p>
