<figure data-uuid="b51b6ca716c9a"><a title="3DS Virtual Console" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b51b6ca716c9a/3ds-virtual-console.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time to talk trademarks again, as Nintendo of America has had a new filing for 'Virtual Console' bumped up to the pending phase. But let's be clear right from the jump, it <em>probably</em> doesn't mean what you're thinking.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT" tabindex="-1">@MikeOdysseyYT</a> on X, the <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=79425775&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">trademark</a> was initially submitted on 21st April 2025, and got boosted up to the pending phase last week on 17th October. The application pertains to two different goods and services classes: IC 009 for "Recorded electronic game programs; downloadable electronic game programs; recorded video game programs" and the like, and IC 041 for "Providing non-downloadable online electronic publications, namely online journals and interactive online blogs featuring user generated or specified content in the field of video games and online publications in the nature of e-books in the field of video games" amongst other things.</p>
<p>NOA currently has two other trademarks for Virtual Console (one renewed in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77975875&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2018</a> and one in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77014121&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2020</a>), each of which is only linked to one of the two 'Goods and Services' classes outlined above.</p>

<p>But does this mean that Virtual Console will be making a comeback? Probably not, honestly. Trademarking is a long-running game of protection, and Nintendo is <em>always</em> on top of it. The company issues renewals all the time, ensuring that its wording, names and IP all remain under the same legal umbrella — some of them turn into something, but most of them are just to keep everything on lock.</p>
<p>That said, this <em>isn't</em> a renewal. The application in question is for a new trademark, with the two pre-existing Virtual Console ones staying where they are. The fact that the newbie compiles the Goods and Services classes of the two others makes us think that this is just a pre-emptive way to move everything into one neat TM, but excited speculation is bound to lean in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Even putting the typical behaviour of trademarks to one side, we can't imagine that Nintendo would be considering bringing back the Virtual Console program while it continues to put Nintendo Switch Online front and centre. Sure, it would be lovely to get the chance to buy some of these classics on modern hardware, but why risk NSO subs in the process?</p>
<p>So yes, there may soon be a new trademark in town, but let's not get those hopes up, eh?</p>

<figure data-uuid="ac88530929fc2"><a title="Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac88530929fc2/legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest <strong>Pokémon</strong> adventure has landed on the Switch and Switch, letting players roam about a much-expanded rendition of Lumiose City from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X &amp; Y</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has received some fairly mixed reception so far, though it seems most are in agreement that although it might not be the prettiest game ever made (far from it!), the new real-time battle system is pretty solid. The Switch 2 Edition is currently sitting at 80 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Metacritic</a>.</p>
<p>In our own 7/10 review (for the Switch 2 version), we said that Z-A "should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:192632,192371 @ 1760975135 -->
<p>So, have you picked up Legends Z-A on the Switch or Switch 2 yet? If so, we're eager to hear what you'd personally score it out of 10. And don't worry if you haven't bought it yet or you feel you haven't progressed very far – you can always come back at a later date and provide your score when you're ready.</p>
<p>If you've already rated the game in our database, good job! You won't need to vote in the below polls since your will have already counted. Again though, feel free to change it if you like.</p>
<p>We've got two polls this time: one for the Switch 2 Edition, and one for the OG Switch, so be sure to vote in the correct one!</p>
