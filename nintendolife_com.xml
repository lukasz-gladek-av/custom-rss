<p>Fans of the cult 2015 movie <strong>Turbo Kid</strong>, rejoice! The upcoming Metroidvania sequel to the post-apocalyptic action movie is coming to Switch on 5th August 2025.</p>
<p>We first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> in February 2024, before it launched on Steam in April of that year. Now, the wait is over for Switch owners as you'll be able to pedal through the wasteland next month.</p>
<p>Developed by Outerminds, Turbo Kid takes place in a futuristic version of the '80s, where neon lights aren't necessarily a good thing. The world has crumbled; water is hard to come by and the wasteland is ruled by tyranny. So, what do you do? Grab your BMX and get biking.</p>
<p>Accompanied by gorgeous pixel art and a fantastic electronica soundtrack from Le Matos, even if you've never seen or heard of the movie, it's one to keep an eye on. Here's a rundown on what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pedal. Slash. Explode. Repeat. -</strong> Rediscover the Metroidvania you should have grown up with. Blaze your trail through a mutant-infested wasteland, upgrade your arsenal of absurdly deadly weapons, and leave a trail of pixelated guts in your wake—all from the seat of your trusty BMX.</p>
<p><strong>BMX Combat -</strong> Who needs a horse when you have a bike with attitude? Call your BMX anytime to boost through maps, unlock shortcuts, smash enemies, or just pull sick tricks. It’s the first true Metroidvania where two wheels matter (no need to fact-check that).</p>
<p><strong>Slash, Shoot, Splat -</strong> Machetes? Of course. Turbo Glove™? Absolutely. From electric blasts to saw blades, your toolkit is overflowing with over-the-top destruction. Rip through enemies with style and turn every screen into a spray of beautifully deranged pixel gore.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom to Explore, Freedom to Wreck -</strong> Set just after the events of the film, forge your path through a twisted world filled with bizarre characters and unexpected choices. Who you help—or hurt—will shape your journey across multiple playthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>All Killer, No Filler -</strong> Love lore? It’s here. Hate it? Skip it. We built Turbo Kid with pure gameplay in mind: no unskippable cutscenes, no walls of text—just fast, fluid action and flexible storytelling that works whether you’re exploring or speedrunning.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 2 arrived with a bunch of titles that had to perform well if they were going to be worth your time. Arguably, none were more in need of a silky smooth frame rate than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, which had to be top notch if it was ever going to appeal to the fighting fans.</p>
<p>We had a blast with the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> last month, with the performance in all modes (apart from World Tour) being a particular highlight. But for those who want the specific numbers, the experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6KBxxvdXo">Digital Foundry</a> have finally joined the fight to give a detailed rundown of all the tech specs in Capcom's latest.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with image quality, DF's Thomas Morgan states that the Switch 2 version "punches well above its weight". The Switch 2 puts up <strong>960x540p</strong> resolution in docked mode, with the DLSS upscaler boosting things to <strong>1080p</strong>. The analysis notes that you may encounter some flickers here and there, but it's a "win on balance" in the grand scheme of things, and even appears crisper than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Naturally, the image quality pales in comparison to the PS5's 4K offering, but the textures are a notable upgrade from the Series S and fall closer in line to what you'd find on the PS4.</p>
<p>Some settings are missing on Switch 2 — the depth of field effect, 'Crowded' background NPCs, no movement for physics-based particles — though DF emphasises that these are "never game-breaking".</p>
<p>The portable mode opts for a <strong>640x360p</strong> resolution, with DLSS reconstructing it up to <strong>720p</strong>, and lighting and shadows take a big hit because of it, winding up closer to the base PS4 edition. There's a docked/handheld comparison in the above video around the 8:20 mark that's well worth a look if you want to see the changes in action.</p>
<p>The World Tour modes are deemed "less polished in their visual delivery overall," with regular NPC pop-ins and reduced frame rates for characters at range. That said, DF is quick to point out that Switch 2 is "not alone in presenting these problems, rather, it inherits them from the other console releases".</p>
<p>In terms of frame rate, things are locked at a "perfect" <strong>60fps</strong> in both docked and handheld in the fighting rounds, but they do drop to around 45fps in the pre-fight hype sequences — not that it affects the game at all. The World Tour mode, as expected, is not as smooth, with the unlocked frame rate reaching anywhere from <strong>30-60fps</strong>, and getting capped at 30 in the side-on battles.</p>
<p>All in all, then, it sounds like a generally strong technical experience on Switch 2. You can see all of this analysis in action in the above Digital Foundry video, but for our thoughts on the game, you'll find our full review below.</p>
