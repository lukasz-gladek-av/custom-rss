<hr>
<p>For some, football is something to play; for some, it’s something to watch; for others, it’s something to be scared of in the playground. But in 2001, in Ecuador, football meant just about everything to just about everyone. At least, that’s the story told by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a>, a game that conjures the magic of childhood and football fever and makes it captivatingly relatable.</p>
<p>The game opens with you playing video soccer on an old console. As it’s gradually revealed that you’re sitting in a family living room, your parents’ chatter creeping into your awareness, you are connected very intimately with the protagonist of the game — its designer — Julián, a kid in Ecuador in 2001.</p>
<p>That year, Ecuador clinched a game against Peru, starting a journey towards first-time World Cup qualification, and everyone’s there for it. Your family are watching football, school kids are playing football at break time, overheard grown-up conversations are about football, and it’s blaring on TVs in bars and shop windows. The sense of optimism brewing around this national event permeates every aspect of life and it’s impossible not to be swept up in it.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161209/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This historic moment fixes the story in place and time, creating a little bubble of childhood. The nostalgia is flavoured with small adventures, like skipping school to take in the glorious scenery of Ecuador, aggravating your teacher, and playing out too long in the rain.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, this is all delivered in a variety of ways. That opening moment of playing on the console gives you a top-down, black-and-white football game, controlled with an innovative two-stick arrangement. The game then moves into first person, your “real-world” playtime football-kicking coming to mirror the console game’s controls. From this perspective, you sit in class, check your watch, skip school, talk to your friends, and, yes, kick around a football.</p>
<p>Much of the time, you're just an observer, building the sense of being a kid and following whatever is set out for you by the adults in your life. You listen to lessons while you wait for the bell; you ride in the back seat and hear conversations happening in the front. Among the passive moments are a variety of first-person interactions, almost always involving or adjacent to football.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161214/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despelote doesn’t try to riff on a central mechanic. In place of that, it develops themes of memory and childhood through a range of gameplay approaches. This keeps the experience light while making the excitement about the football feel totally irresistible. However you look at it, however you interact with it, everything is football. From Julián Cordero’s perspective, everything orbits around football, but other key moments in Ecuador’s history play out, too, from dollarisation to the country’s first showing at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
<p>This gameplay-light approach does mean Despelote asks for a certain mindset. This isn’t a game driven by challenge, mastery, or meaningful choice, and there are long stretches where your role is simply to exist in the moment it presents. Progress is gentle, more like turning a page of a book than developing gameplay, and the designer is happier letting scenes wash over you than pushing you forward. If you’re willing to meet it on those terms, the restraint feels purposeful; if not, this gentle vignette may feel too far from a traditional game.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161210/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the game could hardly be more distinctive. The art, by Sebastián Valbuena, sees figures drawn by hand in black outlines on white backgrounds making up the cast of the game. They sit on top of hazily dithered two-tone scenes. This effect layered on top of the 3D environment completely disguises the level of detail in the world, its lighting and textures – almost anything that might normally contribute to overall visual impressions.</p>
<p>The graphics are therefore, in a sense, flawless. The art direction is expressed to its full, love it or hate it. In motion, it comes to life in a way screenshots can’t convey, and once you're immersed, the world is living and breathing. This is helped by the voicing of all dialogue and the inclusion of real video of football matches, displayed through the same vibrant filter.</p>
<p>All the spoken language is Spanish, with English speech bubbles written out onscreen. This adds beautifully to the sense of place and authenticity; I was transported to Ecuador and my imagination ran with it. Meanwhile, active sound effects and incidental sounds lift the realism of the world. Music is relatively sparse and often diegetic, with key moments of wistful guitar – but this contributes to a matter-of-fact tone that doesn’t overegg the emotional heart of the story. And an emotional response is what the game is all about. Yes, football provides a pitch for it to play on, but this is a relatable story even to someone with no interest in the sport.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161213/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A slightly dry tone also makes room for some light humour. With Despelote, Cordero doesn’t take himself too seriously. A lack of self-importance places the protagonist as just one thread in the tapestry, which again builds a sense of a moment in history. A remembered story is always one you can’t alter, so drifting through this autobiographical account makes total sense. That said, if you’re looking for greater agency or action, maybe this won’t quite be for you.</p>
<p>It’s to Cordero’s credit that they also knew when to stop. The game tells its story without padding, then ties it in a bow and bids farewell after just a couple of hours. It lands as a complete work and can’t be criticised for being short – but bear in mind that this is not some open-ended adventure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With its distinctive presentation and light-touch mechanics, Despelote builds a mesmerising feeling of a community brought together by a fleeting football obsession. The historic moment of Ecuador’s journey towards World Cup qualification grounds the story in time and place, perfectly capturing the author’s salad days. Whether you play, watch, or avoid football, this is a beautifully-told story you can enjoy.</p></section>

Not just any ol' weekend either! No, it's the weekend before Christmas, which means it's time to start preparing your stomachs for an avalanche of food and chocolate.</p>
<p>This week in the world of Nintendo, it seems that there may be an alternative to those ruddy Game Key Cards after an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-has-a-game-key-card-alternative-in-the-works-with-smaller-switch-2-carts">announcement from ININ Games</a>. We also received a lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/divinity-original-sin-2-gets-surprise-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-its-out-now">new Switch 2 Edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> from Larian Studios, so hopefully this is a little precursor of things to come from the acclaimed developer.</p>
<p>We also heard some rather grim news confirming that the US had its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-us-suffered-its-worst-november-since-1995-in-terms-of-hardware-sales">worst November since 1995</a> in terms of hardware sales, which may be partially attributed to just how darn expensive everything is these days. In lighter news, however, the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrades-free-switch-2-demo-is-now-live">a free demo on the Switch 2 eShop</a>, so be sure to give it a shot if you're interested!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The Christmas spirit is well and truly underway at Casa Jim this weekend, so I’ll be bringing out the big guns with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As has become something of a tradition in recent years, I’ll probably end up dusting off the Wii U GamePad and setting up a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nintendo_land">Nintendo Land</a> to keep everyone happy — they just don’t make ‘em like this any more!</p>
<p>Sure, I technically still have a bunch of 2025 games that I’d like to finish before the year is up, but hey, that’s not very festive now is it?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm checking out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a> on the Switch 2 at the moment, so please keep an eye out for my review very soon!</p>
<p>Otherwise, since I've pretty much finalised my list for Game of the Year, I'm in no hurry to try and play games that I might have missed over the months. With that in mind, I'm going to go back to something familiar and comforting... Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> – how did you know?</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>My head has been up in the (virtual) clouds since the VGA announcement of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ace_combat_8_wings_of_theve">Ace Combat 8: The Wings of Theve</a> so I got back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, a game that is begging for a Switch 2 update. The final physical games arrived so there will also be some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/old_school_rally">Old School Rally</a> thrown into the rotation along with <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> (on my way to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_3">Halo 3</a> now!).</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. It is my goal to wrap it up before 2026. So far up to chapter 9 and loving every bit of it. It reminds me we are but two shy months away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3</a>! Happy holidays everyone!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm playing... oh dear. The same games as last week. Aren't I boring. That's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, and <strong>Astro Prospector</strong>. They're good! And I don't have the brainpower for anything new in the run-up to Christmas!</p>
<p>I'm also playing through the festive content in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a>, but that's because I wrote a lot of it, so... does that count? Probably not. Also, does this count as self-promotion? Am I in trouble? Please don't give me a lump of coal. Or whatever the Nintendo Life version of that is.</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My weekend should be pretty full this side of Christmas (we're having duck), but if I manage to find some time to squeeze in a game or two, I'll definitely be diving into Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition. I loved the original, but never delved into anything beyond the base game, so I'm keen to see what this new version can throw at me.</p>
<p>Felix and I are also planning to continue our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/we_were_here_together">We Were Here Together</a> at some point as well, but that is... unlikely to happen over the immediate weekend.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> is going to take Zach and I a <em>long</em> time to get through. We're maybe 35 hours through and the town building has only just opened up more. How long do we have left? No idea, and that's kind of exciting!</p>
<p>But for the holidays, I've picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a>. The latter I've been waiting to come to Switch for a while, and the former seems like perfect cosy Christmas gaming. However you celebrate, readers, make time for your loved ones and get some rest!</p>
