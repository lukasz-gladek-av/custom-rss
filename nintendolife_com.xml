<p>Last year, Nintendo lifted the lid on a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_tennis">Mario Tennis</a> game for the Switch 2. It's called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and will be launching next month on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We've not really seen or heard much about it since then, but now that the new year is officially underway (<em>and the tennis pro tour is back at it</em>), Nintendo has taken a brief moment out of its schedule to remind Switch 2 owners that this new entry will offer a stacked roster. In fact, in case you missed it, it's got the "most" playable characters in the series' history.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067psyohq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>This includes not only Daisy and Peach but also "36 other characters", and there's also a chance Nintendo could expand on this with updates. In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_tennis_aces">Mario Tennis Aces</a> on the Switch ended with a total of 30 playable characters (including unlockable and DLC characters).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "This should be easy. Pre-order #MarioTennisFever and play as Daisy, Peach, and 36 other characters"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the other characters include Donkey Kong, Bowser, the Baby Mario crew, Rosalina, Yoshi and even Petey Piranha. Although a lot of characters have been spotted, the full roster hasn't been confirmed just yet. There'll also be 30 different "Fever Rackets", featuring their own special abilities.</p>
<p>Along with the large roster, players can also expect multiple modes including Tournament, Trial Towers, Mix It Up Mode (including Wonder effects), an Adventure Mode, and there'll also be Joy-Con 2 motion controls for the game's Swing Mode.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/random-speedrunner-becomes-first-person-to-complete-super-meat-boy-deathless</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a>'s reputation precedes it. The notoriously-difficult precision platformer is designed to be extremely challenging, and death on every single screen is basically inevitable. Amazingly, it's taken over 15 years for anyone to fully complete the game — that's get 106% completion — without dying, but it <em>finally</em> happened at the end of last year (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-taken-15-years-but-someones-finally-completed-super-meat-boy-without-dying-once">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Back in December, Nintendo speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7bnhmqT3s">shredberg</a> became the first person ever to fully complete Super Meat Boy deathless. Yes, seriously, no one has been able to do this since the game was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010. The platformer came to Switch in 2018.</p>
<p>"I've been doing this way too long" shredberg says laughing after his record-breaking win. "I'm not saying that I wasn't nervous, because I was very nervous at the end there, but I was way more nervous just in Dark Cotton... Once I got past Dark Hell 2, I was relatively fine."</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be emailing everyone — Kotaku, IGN, CNN, Chef's Illustrated. They're all going to hear about it."</p>
<p>You can watch the full two hour stream up-top, but if you've even played a few minutes of Super Meat Boy, you know how tough this game can be. shredberg, somehow, makes this look effortless.</p>
<p>Even one of the game's co-creators, Edmund McMillen, congratulated shredberg on social media with a simple "Congrats!"</p>

<p>Sharing his achievement on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Supermeatboy/comments/1pnjrqr/i_got_106_without_dying/">Supermeatboy subreddit</a>, shredberg thinks it took him "like 700-800 hours of grinding" to reach this goal, which is staggering.</p>
<p>He's been streaming much of his progress over on Twitch over the years, in-between other speedruns for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's next? Some followers on the archived stream have made some suggestions for shredberg, such as playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or other games. Whatever it is, we hope shredberg has fun. Congrats on the record!</p>
