<p>The digital band consisting of fictional members Noodle, 2D, Murdoc, and Russel — founded by Blur frontman Damon Albarn and <strong>Tank Girl</strong> co-creator Jamie Hewlett — will be making its debut in-game tomorrow, 26th August 2025.</p>
<p>Alongside the band, players will also be getting a new Main Stage, brand new tracks to jam along to in the form of the group's biggest hits (DARE, Clint Eastwood, and On Melancholy Hill), new Music Pass rewards, costumes, and more.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mnyspt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>A few gameplay adjustments are also coming when the new season drops tomorrow, such as new "Good" notes and changes to the design of lift notes. A full list of additions and updates — some free, some premium — can be found on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/gorillaz-enter-a-new-universe-as-fortnite-festival-season-10-icons">official Fortnite website</a>.</p>

<p>Bruno Mars was the most-recent headline for Fortnite Festival, with Sabrina Carpenter, Hatsune Miku, and Metallica among other names that have participated.</p>
<p>So, Gorillaz, then! A big deal for those of us who grew up in the late '90s and early 2000s. We definitely didn't feel our age when we say that Demon Days was 20 years old...</p>

<p>"Even PlayStation was never this in touch with the fan base"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Party Jamboree + Shawn Layden" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf55cf7fa7ae1/mario-party-jamboree-plus-shawn-layden.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shawn Layden, formerly the President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and Executive Vice President and COO of Sony Network Entertainment International, has come out in praise of Nintendo for being the most in-touch with its fan base.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD0gJdspbqo&amp;ab_channel=HipHopGamer">HipHopGamer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/former-playstation-boss-says-no-one-is-in-touch-with-their-fan-base-more-than-nintendo-and-even-sony-was-never-this-in-touch-with-what-players-wanted/">GamesRadar+</a>), Layden says that the reason Nintendo hasn't suffered from the same amount of slowdown as other publishers post-Covid is because the company has "been very intentional in what lane they play in," by specifically focusing on "who their fans are and what their fans want."</p>
<p>Layden believes that "No one is more in touch with their fan base than Nintendo. Even PlayStation was never this in touch with the fan base as Nintendo is" and that as gaming sales and revenues climbed during the pandemic, other publishers decided to chase the "curve" by hiring more people.</p>
<p>When lockdown restrictions ended, however, Layden says that Nintendo anticipated the drop-off: "They stayed on course. They had their plan. They're moving their plan. So they didn’t have to suffer the peaks and valleys so much as if you're chasing the opportunity."</p>
<p>"They just know what their opportunity is. They see it. They understand it better than anyone else. And they go for it and they do it really well." You can watch the full interview below.</p>

<p>Of course, whether you agree with Layden's opinion is another thing, but the Switch 2 is delivering early days with multiple genres and returning icons. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> is due to launch this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> saw DK return in his first-grand new game in over a decade, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is a surprise sequel to a GameCube favourite, so we'll see whether this continues into the new console's life.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you think Nintendo understands its fan base in the comments.</em></p></section>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8837dd01c7bff/switch-2-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/tw/topics/article/41w52icBln3gcAi5ePKEBt">announced plans to open the Nintendo eShop in Taiwan</a> next month, on 9th September 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52110-nintendo-eshop-set-to-go-live-in-taiwan-sept-9th-2025">GoNintendo</a>!)</p>
<p>Previously, fans would have had to visit the eShop in either Japan or Hong Kong, but with a dedicated Taiwanese storefront, they'll have a much easier option.</p>
<p>In the announcement (translated by Google), Nintendo stated that fans will be able to "enjoy a more convenient and enriched gaming experience" and that "specific service content will be announced separately in the near future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mnyspt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's yet another step in Nintendo's expansion into the Taiwanese market. The Big N opened up a new subsidiary, Nintendo of Taiwan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">in February 2025</a>, and the company has been running operations since 1st April this year.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Nintendo even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justdan.taiwan/posts/pfbid033YL9t1A1e6gsMwS6wRSDRVhH8MAtdUMhpTpe2HphWwsZhUN5p36jBgXVYhf7gam4l">opened a Flagship Store</a> in the Xinyi district in Taipei in April, too. Given the company's rapid growth in Taiwan, and after its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/nintendo-celebrates-switch-in-style-with-packed-taipei-game-show-booth">line-up at the 2024 Taipei Game Show</a>, it seems like its presence will just keep expanding.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Logo Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc8b2a0361e9b/nintendo-logo-gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ant Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A Nintendo Direct is reportedly on the way, and it'll be taking place mid-September.</p>
<p>The claim originally came from SwitchForce over on <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">X</a> (formerly Twitter), but VGC has also heard from multiple sources that a presentation is planned for <strong>12th September</strong>. If that's the case, it'll be taking place the day before the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros</a>.</p>
<p>The 12th <em>is</em> a Friday, which is a bit of an unusual day for a Direct, but Nintendo has previously held presentations on the last working day of the week, with the most-recent being an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>-focused one in 2021. Others have looked at Super Nintendo World (2020), the Wii U, and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-direct-presentation-full-broadcast-history-list">bigger general Direct in 2013</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Plus, besides 2024, Nintendo has held a Direct in September every single year, except last year. So a Direct in September is almost expected. Of course, as always, none of this is confirmed until Nintendo says anything, so remember that healthy pinch of salt!</p>

<p>One of the big reveals of this rumoured Direct will likely be Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release date. The game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">was recently rated</a>, meaning it's most likely ready. That and the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are the only big 2025 releases waiting on a date.</p>
<p>So, let's wait and see what happens, then.</p>
