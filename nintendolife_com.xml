<p>Our pals over at <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-a-massive-cross-gen-gap">Digital Foundry</a> have provided their verdict on the recently-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Switch and Switch 2, covering the tech utilised and the performance gap between the two consoles.</p>
<p>Looking at the visuals in the sole location of Lumiose City, Digital Foundry states that the execution is rough around the edges, looking "garish" even on the Switch 2. One particular highlight is the fact that the majority of NPCs found on your travels are motionless; rooted the spot in set locations (and yes, we've also covered this in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-creepiest-entry-yet-not-in-a-good-way">previous feature piece</a>).</p>
<p>Both versions feature copious pop-in, while many of the pedestrians also pop-<em>out</em> when you move closer to them. On a positive note, however, Switch 2 features a lot more detail in the environments, with sharper textures in general. However, the repeated flat texture maps for the buildings' windows and balconies is called out as being a huge negative, with pixelated visuals when you get close up.</p>
<p>Switch 2's biggest upgrade comes with its overall image quality. It utilises DLSS upscaling to bring the resolution up to a 1440p target while docked and 1080p in handheld mode, and the difference between the two consoles is night and day. Meanwhile, frame rate for the Switch targets 30fps, but often drops down into the 20s when panning the camera around. The Switch 2, meanwhile, is locked at 60fps with only very rare drops.</p>
<p>Pretty much what we'd expected, then, but it's lovely to get a proper breakdown from the tech experts over at Digital Foundry. You can check out their full verdict and more over on their brand new website.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Believe it or not, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is almost upon us. That <strong>4th December</strong> release date is Morph Balling ever closer, and today, we've got our latest round of hands-on previews to give us a taste of what we can expect.</p>
<p>Our very own video producer extraordinaire, Alex Olney, was lucky enough to attend an extended preview event for Samus' latest adventure, and it sounds like he had a jolly good time. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">preview</a>, Alex sings the praises of the game's fun new psychic abilities and gorgeous environments, though one of the new Galactic Troopers firmly got on his nerves.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from the full hands-on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest and most important parts of the Prime series (and the Metroid series as a whole) is the feeling of isolation, loneliness, and that you’re being forced to fight against the environment that doesn’t want you there to begin with. That notion is entirely destroyed once you introduce a character that blathers away at you incessantly, and it'll be a crying shame if this is something that is present throughout the full game’s runtime</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:193706 @ 1763139609 -->
<p>But Mr. Olney wasn't the only one to share his preliminary thoughts on the game today; quite the opposite, in fact! Other outlets have also had the chance to play through an early section of the game, and we've assembled the following round-up to see what a selection of them made of it.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-delivers-the-series-trademark-gameplay-in-spades-but-i-fear-one-very-annoying-addition-might-derail-the-whole-thing">Eurogamer</a>, where the outlet's preview mirrored many of the same concerns as ours: the game looks and plays wonderfully, but gosh, that Trooper is annoying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed the puzzles, the shooting, and very much appreciated the game's control options and visual flair. A huge amount of trepidation about Metroid's usually glorious atmosphere being wrecked now runs through that anticipation, though, like lettering through a stick of seaside rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things went much the same way in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview">IGN</a>'s preview, too, where the gorgeous environments and classic puzzles were overshadowed by a chatty companion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classic Metroid Prime exploration and combat, an intriguing setup, gorgeous art direction, and great technical performance on Switch 2 are coming together to create an adventure that likely won’t redefine Metroid in any meaningful way – or live up to the unrealistic hype built by nearly a decade of waiting – but one that could serve as a great return for a subseries that hasn’t seen a new mainline entry in 18 years, as long as annoying sidekicks don’t keep getting in Samus’ way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/so-far-metroid-prime-4-doesnt-feel-like-metroid-at-all/">VGC</a>'s worries about these features ran even deeper, with the outlet's preview cautiously warning that the opening section "didn’t feel much like Metroid at all":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Metroid Prime 4 is seemingly trying to be is a far less interesting, and more dated, type of first-person action game with none of the mood the series is known for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not all doom and gloom, mind you. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-samuss-psychic-abilities-are-more-than-a-gimmick/1100-6536193/">GameSpot</a> didn't find Myles MacKenzie nearly as annoying as other outlets, even going as far as to call him "endearing", and instead focused much of the preview on Samus' cool new psychic powers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo and Retro Studios appear to understand the fundamental core of what makes a Metroid Prime game, with satisfying exploration, tense combat puzzles, and meaningful new abilities that change how you look at the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/after-18-years-metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-a-surprisingly-magical-return-to-nintendos-legendary-series-and-im-all-in-on-psychic-abilities-and-the-power-of-friendship/">GamesRadar+</a> felt a similar way, it seems, writing that Samus' companions and abilities might make for a nice surprise in the long run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond demo I played, then, suggests an unexpected direction for the Metroid Prime series – possibly more whimsy than isolation. It's nothing like what I expected. But with the demanding life Samus has lived, I'm glad for all the butterflies she can get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrapping things up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-preview-switch-2/">Polygon</a>'s preview remains optimistic, noting how, despite the new features, the game still feels distinctly <em>Metroid</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is not just a rehash of Retro’s original run. It’s a tonal divergence, a bit sillier in places, a bit more gruesome in others. But <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> still plays the series’ greatest hits.</p>
</blockquote>
