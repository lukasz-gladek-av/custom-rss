<p>UK, Australia, and the US affected</p>

<p>Eager <strong>Trails</strong> fans, old and new, are getting their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> today, the remake of the 2004 RPG from Falcom that kicked off the Trails series. With Limited Run Games and Clear River Games handling Steelbook and Bracer Editions, a lot of love and care seems to have gone into this remake.</p>
<p>But today, both physical edition publishers have revealed that they've hit issues in getting those special editions in the hands of some customers (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lz6vmo4zuc23">Wario64</a>)</p>
<p>Limited Run Games has been emailing those who pre-ordered the game about "unexpected manufacturing delays" for both the steelbook and Bracer Edition, and that these will now be "shipping out later than the initially planned date of September 19, 2025."</p>

<p>Over on X (formerly Twitter), European distributor <a href="https://x.com/clearrivergames/status/1968993500042547307?s=19">Clear River Games states</a> that "We began fulfilling all Trails in the SKy steelbook orders earlier this week, despite the games arriving at our warehouse later than expected due to production delays."</p>
<p>While it has managed to ship orders across the EU, the UK, Australia, and other regions, "complications with our shipping partner" have caused other regions to be hit by delays.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Clear River says it has finally found a solution, and the remaining orders will be shipped today. Hopefully this bodes well for Limited Run Games pre-orders too.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed the wait isn't too long for those of you who are big Trails fans — the remake has been getting rave reviews, and this is the perfect entry point for newcomers, too.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like we're essentially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-contains-teaser-for-the-sequel">guaranteed to get a remake of the sequel</a>, given what footage has been shared online by those who go to the game early.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/702d88e5933be/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> surprised many when it was revealed at last week's Nintendo Direct; we've already got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">I &amp; II HD Remake</a> on the way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">III HD Remake</a> is already out. Surely the next logical step is the <strong>Zenithian Trilogy</strong> - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_iv">IV</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_v_hand_of_the_heavenly_bride">V</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_vi_realms_of_revelation">VI</a>?</p>
<p>Well, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii spoke about the upcoming game on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DaeJ3TFMFM">Yuubou &amp; Mashirito no KosoKoso Housoukyoku channel</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/18468-yuji-horii-comments-on-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-coming-before-dragon-quest-iv-v-vi-remakes">RPG Site</a>!), where he co-hosts monthly streams with former Weekly Shonen Jump editor-in-chief Kazuhiko "Mashirito" Torishima.</p>
<p>During a stream earlier this week, on 15th September, the duo are talking about the upcoming Dragon Quest remake, with Torishima casually mentioning the next one isn't IV, V, or VI.</p>
<p>Horii's response, around 44:45, is predictably vague (all translations by RPG Site): "A lot of things are moving around, but it was just done first by chance." So, does that mean more remakes are on the way? Torishima probed Horii, who simply repeated the same words, laughing.</p>
<p>Torishima continues to rock the boat a little bit by saying "It's like it does not mean that they are not doing 4-5-6", but again, Horii repeatedly denies, saying "I didn't say it" three times.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Horii starts talking about the remake — and the Zenithian Trilogy — to MC Naz Chris. "As I said just now, we want to make them playable on ongoing platforms", he tells her. And in response to her question about VII Reimagined "progressing smoothly?," Horii says the team has "a lot of progress" already.</p>
<p>But, like Torishima, Naz Chris can't help but give a little nudge, suggesting that Dragon Quest IV might "be taking more time" because of its "chapter divisions". Horii laughs in response.</p>
<p>It's definitely an odd choice to hop straight to VII after doing I &amp; II, but hey, we're happy to see the Dragon Quest series get some extra love on Switch and Switch 2. We do hope to see Dragon Quest XII in the near future, though...</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-closer-look">Square Enix posted a detailed blog</a> about many of the game's visual updates and changes, along with combat, character, and story details.</p>
