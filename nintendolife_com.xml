<figure data-uuid="d408b4e448d3b"><a title="MK4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d408b4e448d3b/mk4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Midway</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gosh, we're into November already – how on earth did that happen? Well, either way, it's the weekend, so let's do a quick recap of the week before we dive into what we're playing, shall we?</p>
<p>Naturally, the biggest news of the week was the announcement from Nintendo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> would be making a comeback, with both a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update">free update planned for all owners alongside a paid Switch 2 Edition</a> in the new year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> is also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-today-with-a-spooky-classic">now available on the Switch</a> via an NSO + Expansion Pack subscription, so hopefully a few of you have been playing this one for Halloween.</p>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">a bunch of announcements</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> revealed that a special Pro Controller will be launching alongside the game, with a Grace Ashcroft amiibo following in Summer 2026. Neat!</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer<br></h2>
<p>I recently picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, and it really is delightful. The performance issues on Switch 2 are definitely apparent, but it's really got its hooks in me. I find myself constantly tweaking little bits of my museum, taking "just one more" expedition to nab another fossil or skeleton for my collection, and simply sitting back to admire my handy work. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>I'd like to play some more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, but I'm tempted to put it aside for a little bit until the online issues are resolved.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have friends staying over this weekend, so I expect a fair amount of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and probably a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> — what can I say? I’m a sucker for a few holes of Golf!</p>
<p>All this does mean that the final Mission or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> will probably have to take a back seat for a couple of days. I’ll finish it soon, I promise!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'll be splitting my time between doing some review stuff and insulating my loft this weekend. Honestly, I wish I was joking. So, not much time for gaming, really, but I definitely will still be chilling with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> at some point, as I've got to get back to that before I forget the story.</p>
<p>Other than this, it'll be quick blasts of BALL x PIT (unbelievably addictive, be warned) and I'm afraid I've gone and bough the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, so hopefully the online issues Ollie <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">pointed out in his review</a> will get sorted down the line. I'm still more than happy to have it portable, to be honest, as online isn't my preferred way to play the old fighting games. Too much stress, mate.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_formation">Final Formation</a> has no right to be this good. Jaleco’s original outing was a staple in Famiclones back in the day and it remains a stellar unlicensed Macross tribute, but this new remake dials everything up to eleven. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> front, Prometheus is being a royal pain on my way to the summit of Mount Olympus. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a> is proving to be good fun and I got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> back into rotation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 45 of 50 games played. What better game to spend Halloween than Night Manor! But Pilot Quest, Elfazar’s Hat and Lords of Diskonia are all top shelf stuff. Only five games to discover!</p>
<p>Game of the week is naturally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>. We must be doing something right because as of right now we have the original trilogy in glorious HD-2D. Now, if only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> HD-2D becomes real...</p>
