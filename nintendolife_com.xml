            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="11c4c6604f2bf"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11c4c6604f2bf/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I <em>adore</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. I know, I know, such a hot take puts me in a niche of... about 98% of people that read this site, but what I mean to say is that when the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the 3.0 update were announced yesterday, I was about as excited as Blathers when you deliver him a fourth Fossil in one day. That's <em>very excited</em>.</p>
<p>I spent the evening grinning about the return of Sonny Resetti, the Mineru Villager (!!), all of the design potential that comes with the Hotel Resort, and bulk crafting! I was even pretty pleased with the Switch 2-specific features like Mouse Mode and GameChat, perhaps not quite as big as the additions that the 3.0 update will provide, but a nice little bonus for four quid.</p>
<p>But then, as I settled into bed after an evening of counting the days until 15th January (77 today, for those interested), I was met with a little pang of worry. "If the New Horizons Switch 2 Edition is arriving with this much pomp," I thought to myself, "it's going to be <em>years</em> until we get a new Animal Crossing!"</p>
<figure data-uuid="d7a897ef76bd6"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7a897ef76bd6/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>If only we could fast forward to the next entry, eh? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't to say I'm particularly keen to move on from New Horizons — if those lockdown months taught me anything, it was that I could play this game forever (given the time) — but I realised that a lot of my Switch 2 excitement was built on seeing what comes next. I've already <em>played</em> New Horizons, and no amount of home storage expansion is going to feel as fresh as a new entry.</p>
<p>I'm starting to see the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions as a big ol' placeholder in Nintendo's release schedule. It's one of those 'we're not quite ready to show you what's next, so here's something familiar to keep you busy in the meantime' moments that we're becoming increasingly well acquainted with. Surely a brand new game would be a much better prospect for console sales?</p>
<p>It was a similar story on Switch. Rather than give us a new Mario Kart, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>; instead of a new 3D Mario, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>. They're great games, no doubt, but they're also a telltale sign of 'you're years away from a new entry, mate'.</p>
<p>And I don't want that for Animal Crossing. New Horizons launched over five years ago *<em>gulp</em>*, and while that's hardly a <em>long</em> wait between series entries, the arrival of the Switch 2 Edition makes me think that Nintendo could easily make us wait another five.Throw in some unexpected content updates a few years down the line to sweeten the deal, à la MK8D's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a>, and we might end up waiting even longer, forever convinced that the 2020 game is delivering something new.</p>

<p>I have no idea where we go next after New Horizons, but I thought the same thing after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a>, and look where that left us! All the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does is delay the next entry. I'll jump back into ACNH and have a wonderful time doing so, but it won't capture the magic of terraforming your island the first time, will it?</p>
<p>More pressingly, putting my industry cap on for a second, Animal Crossing is a system seller. Unless Nintendo has another global pandemic up its sleeve, I can't imagine that a new series entry would hit the 48 million sales that New Horizons mustered, but people would <em>flock</em> to it, all the same. In a launch year that's been criticised for its re-releases, wouldn't 'Animal Crossing: Newer Horizons' be the big push to go out and nab a Switch 2?</p>
<p>It all feels like many of the same concerns that I've had with the console in general these past few months. I think the year-one lineup is fantastic, but I'm fortunate because I <em>like</em> most of the games that are getting re-released. No amount of graphical upgrades or Mouse Mode inclusions can overshadow the fact that these are games that I, and many other people, have played before, some of them just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, this is how console launches work these days, and compared to the Xbox Series or the PS5, the Switch 2 is already off to a flying start as far as its software is concerned.</p>
<p>I also need to remind myself that the past four months haven't been wall-to-wall NS2 Editions. In terms of exclusives, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are right around the corner, then we've got new Switch 2 entries for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem</a> already lined up for 2026. You compare that to the PS5's exclusives list for its first couple of years, and it's a firm reminder that we're eating good!</p>

<p>But I think we're still missing the real big hitter. The Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> seemed like a fair stand-in for a new entry in that series (we have had two newbies in the past two years, to be fair), Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the obvious substitute for a 3D Mario, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> will have us covered on the 2D front soon enough, too.</p>
<p>I was hoping that Animal Crossing would be the biggie to make everyone go, "Yes, now I <em>need</em> a Switch 2", but I fear that January's re-release is a sign that we still have a long wait ahead of us before we can see what Newer Horizons will look like.</p>

<p>A Colorado Federal court has ordered (as per the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/keighin-final.pdf">Final Judgment</a>) that Keighin must pay Nintendo of America $17,500 in damages. This verdict follows on from an additional motion was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-seeks-injunction-and-usd17500-in-damages-from-pirate-streamer">filed in April 2025</a> after Keighin repeatedly evaded responding.</p>
<p>Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak's <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/keighin-reco.pdf">recommendation</a> states that Keighin streamed gameplay footage "before the games were released to the public" on "at least fifty occasions", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> being the most recent example.</p><div><figure data-videoid="3ZPwyfIL_qU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt3ZPwyfIL_qU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed444994ikvphj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Other games include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>However, the court has refused to issue a permanent injunction on the streamer to destroy "all circumvention devices" as it is "unclear what purpose those would serve or what devices would be covered by this provision" as most of them are freely available on the internet.</p>

<p>Similarly, an injunction against third parties has also been denied on the basis that "Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege that Defendant is working in concert with any third party".</p>
<p>In terms of the streaming, the recommendation highlights numerous times where Keighin publicly acknowledges his actions, including sharing links to emulation software on social media and even directly emailing Nintendo to say that he "will actively help people find newer and updated copies".</p>
<p>Keighin has also made other public posts taunting Nintendo, such as "You might run a corporation. I run the streets". We won't share <em>most</em> of those here, though, as many of the posts use strong and derogatory language.</p>
<p>The court has ordered the Keighin to pay $17,500 — $10,000 for streaming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and $500 for 15 violations including distribution of links to emulators, cryptographic keys, and circumventing technological measures to play the unreleased games.</p>
<p>Nintendo has until 13th November 2025 to submit a Status Report to the court laying out its next steps.</p>
