<p>Mario &amp; Luigi vs. Bowser Jr.</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At The Game Awards, Nintendo and Illumination surprised fans with another look at the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>It features Bowser Jr. taking on Mario and Luigi in a very brief teaser. Some not-so-pleasant introductions are exchanged, and before you know it, the younger Bowser is smashing everything in sight. Fortunately, Luigi steps in to save the day (and Mario).</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to arrive in theatres next year in <strong>April 2026</strong>. This latest teaser follows the announcement of the new movie in November, along with an official trailer reveal. You can see the first video in our previous story.</p>
<p>This wasn't the only video game movie trailer shared at The Game Awards this year. Capcom also showed off a first-look at its live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> movie.</p>

<p>Here's a first look at the gameplay</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises of The Game Awards this year was the announcement of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a></strong> for the Switch and Switch 2. It will be releasing on Nintendo systems (and other platforms) at some point in <strong>2027</strong>.</p>
<p>Along with this news was a first look at the gameplay, it doesn't really show all that much, but it does appear to feature the same type of platforming action fans know and love. Here's Capcom's official description to go with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Mega Man returns in 2027 with a brand-new entry in the classic action platforming series! Override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers!"<br></em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from this Mega Man news at The Game Awards, Capcom also announced the sci-fi title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> will be coming to the Switch 2 early next year. There'll also be an amiibo and a demo released in the future.</p>
