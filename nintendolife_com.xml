<p>Update: It's officially over</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata Louvre" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9d7866e0533a4/satoru-iwata-louvre.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-09-02T18:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 2nd Sep 2025, 7:30pm</time>]:</strong> It's official - the Louvre has finally laid its Nintendo 3DS audio guides to rest.</p>
<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/09/02/louvre-says-game-over-to-its-nintendo-3ds-visitor-guide_6744946_13.html">French newspaper Le Monde</a>, the world-renowned museum ended the service on 1st September 2025. It originally announced it would be retiring the novel museum guides sometime in September.</p>
<p>It's an extremely novel concept, so it's a little sad to see it concluding, but it makes sense at this point — maybe Nintendo could get a Switch or Switch 2 audio guide running for the museum, hmm?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:36010,35977 @ 1756845626 --><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> The Louvre Museum in Paris, France is retiring the Nintendo 3DS audio guides for the museum later this year.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/louvre-museum-removing-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides/">Nintendo Everything</a>, the <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">official website for the world-famous museum</a> confirms that the 3DS console audio guides are going "out of operation" sometime in September this year in place of a new system which hasn't been confirmed. A Nintendo Switch 2 app, perhaps...? Oh, come on, you thought it too.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the Louvre and Nintendo first dropped in 2012 — where you could "rent" a 3DS at the Louvre to use as an audio guide. Nintendo even held <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">a dedicated Direct</a> on the collab in 2013 to announce a purchasable version of the software, so people could experience the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. We'll pop that Direct below, because seeing Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto together gave us the warm fuzzies.</p>

<p>The software itself contained high-quality photos and 3D models of much of the museum's iconic artwork. Over 600 images, 30 hours of audio commentary, and more than 400 3D reconstructions of museum rooms are part of the software.</p>
<p>It was, and still is, an extremely unique collaboration, and we're a little bit sad to see it go. But it's been around for 13 years, so it makes sense. So, if you want to experience the Louvre in a truly unique way, then you've got until September 2025 to rent one of those special 3DS's.</p>

<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">Inverse</a>, game director Kazutoyo Maehiro stated that if the upcoming launch does well, then this could potentially open the door to remasters of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> along with brand-new sequels.</p>
<p>Here's what Maehiro had to say:</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fmqnigz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"If The Ivalice Chronicles can do well, that’s good for the fans, they can enjoy it. But, at the same time, it shows the business viability of the strategy RPG genre. So that could potentially open the door for doing something with <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> or <em>A2,</em> or maybe even sequels and new titles as well.</p>
<p>"I think I speak for everyone who’s worked on the original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>, and is working on <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> as well — we’d really like to see that happen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tactics Advance (2003) and Tactics A2 (2007) launched for the GBA and DS respectively to strong critical reception, though it's fair to say that neither were quite able to match the cultural impact of the original PS1 game.</p>
<p>That said, we're certain fans would love to see both titles remastered for modern systems, and y'know what, we definitely would too. For now, we'll have to make do with The Ivalice Chronicles. If you're excited to play this one, then be sure to vote with your wallets if you want to see more from Square Enix.</p>
