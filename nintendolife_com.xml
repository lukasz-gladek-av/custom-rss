<p>Meet the new boss</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo of America has a new President and COO, and during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HNNugGXKQ0?t=3522">15th Annual New York Game Awards</a>, Devon Pritchard made her first public appearance in her new role.</p>
<p>Introduced by ex-Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé and New York Times columnist Harold Goldberg, Pritchard appeared via a pre-recorded video to celebrate the Game Awards and the nonprofit 'Playing With Purpose' writing programme, which looks to provide workshops in journalism and game narrative writing in school across New York.</p>
<p>If you're unable to watch the video right now, here's Pritchard's message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hi everyone, it is great to be here. My name is Devon, and before anything else, I want to celebrate the New York Game Awards. 15 years of supporting the games industry and in doing so lifting up the voices, stories, and dreams of so many.</p>
<p>"This show connects people who are united by a shared belief that every dream matters, and that everyone deserves a chance to do meaningful and creative work in games and storytelling. The 'Playing With Purpose' programme supports the creators, the coders, the writers, and anyone else dreaming big to join this community and bring all that makes them unique.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to meet you! To hear those stories and to learn from your journeys. And remember, like any good video game character, you're on an adventure, and every step you take matters. There's some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you, and powerful rewards for those who persevere.</p>
<p>"So keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pritchard took over the role of President and COO of Nintendo of America when her predecessor, Doug Bowser, stepped down at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Pritchard will have a big task ahead of her in spearheading the next generation of Nintendo with the Switch 2. The console has gotten off to a great start, but concerns around price uncertainty and Game-Key Cards linger in the minds of fans around the world.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3eec723f1e377"><a title="Code Veronica" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3eec723f1e377/code-veronica.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the next mainline entry in Capcom's survival horror series, is scheduled to launch in just over a month on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It seems, however, that Capcom might have another title lined up for a reveal later this year.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449">Dusk Golem</a>, who has had a history of accurately reporting Capcom's plans for Resident Evil, the company will be announcing a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> in 2026 (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcoms-next-big-resident-evil-remake-will-reportedly-be-revealed-this-year/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Code Veronica, largely regarded as a mainline entry in all but name, has been long rumoured to receive the remake treatment, and Dusk Golem seems particularly confident that this is real, stating plainly "I promise you".</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0wjrpgm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"No, there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year. Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions arose around a potential remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> after Eva La Dare, the voice actor behind Sheva Alomar in the 2009 original, stated that she's "Got a few fun things lined up for March" in relation to Resident Evil's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>Capcom <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zombies-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-but-now-theyre-more-terrifying-than-ever">recently showcased</a> more gameplay for Resident Evil Requiem ahead of its release, highlighting the differences between protagonists Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. It's also been confirmed that those after a challenge can set the difficulty higher and thus necessitate the use of Ink Ribbons during Grace's sections.</p>

<p>I'm all aflutter</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>A risqué <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> island aimed at 'adults only' has been deleted by Nintendo after more than five years.</p>
<p>This comes courtesy of creator <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894">@churip_ccc</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/">Automaton</a>), who posted on social media to confirm the deletion, stating "To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Actually, just a day before the update,<br></em><em>The Dream Address for the Adult Island was deleted by Nintendo.<br></em><em>To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.<br></em><em>Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years.<br></em><em>To everyone who visited the island,<br></em><em>And to all the streamers who showcased it in their videos,<br></em><em>Thank you so much."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The island in question contains its own Edo-inspired 'Red Light District', while certain shops sell nothing but schoolgirl-inspired cosplay and toys. <em>Yikes</em>. Looking at the video above, more subtle hints towards the island's 'adult only' theme include magazine and posters littering the floor, some labelled 'DVD' in pink font.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blathers' museum-inspired room has an entire corner dedicated to pictures of Isabelle, with seemingly used tissues strewn about the place. Must have a runny nose, huh?</p>
<p>It's interesting that Nintendo took so long to get rid of it in this case, but alas, it's gone. No doubt we'll see similar attempts in the future, but we reckon Nintendo will be pretty vigilant if it happens again.</p>
