<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161187/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I absolutely adore the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake from Nightdive Studios. When it launched on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">PS5</a> last year, this reimagining of Looking Glass' 1994 classic was just about all I could think about for weeks on end thanks to its immersive gameplay, oppressive atmosphere, and stunning visuals that blend pixel-art textures with advanced lighting technology.</p>
<p>I do <em>not</em>, however, adore System Shock on the Switch 2. In fact, the game’s performance on Nintendo’s console is so poor at launch, I’d recommend giving it a wide berth for the time being.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the positives. In terms of content, everything from the PC and console release is retained here on the Switch 2 port. This is a strictly single-player narrative experience with three difficulty options available across four separate categories: Combat, Mission, Cyber, and Puzzle – lots to tinker with to suit your tastes, then.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161189/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Your mission is to survive the horrors within Citadel Station and bring down the rogue AI, SHODAN. The station itself is separated into distinct floors, starting with Medical. You’ll need to explore each floor thoroughly, collecting audio logs, equipment, and weapons, while combating a plethora of cybernetic monstrosities. Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> is widely regarded as the spiritual predecessor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bioshock_remastered">BioShock</a>, you can still see the latter’s DNA in the original game, and Nightdive’s remake showcases it wonderfully. The audio logs, in particular, really help to provide key narrative context.</p>
<p>System Shock’s FPS gameplay is slow and methodical; you’ll inch your way around the station to get the drop on your enemies, while the in-game inventory will need frequent TLC to ensure you’re only carrying the essentials. Thankfully, any junk you do pick up on the way can be vaporised into scrap via the inventory screen. This can then be taken to designated locations in the station and swapped for cash.</p>
<p>You’re encouraged, then, to pick up as much stuff as you can and vaporise what you don’t actually need. This may prove tedious for some, but for me it was reminiscent of the attache case from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, with larger items taking up more inventory slots. I enjoy the rhythmic maintenance required to keep it in tip-top shape.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161192/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Weapons procured along the way do a good job at fending off enemies, and there’s a healthy mix of melee and projectile at your disposal. Ammo is quite scarce, so you’ll often find that using the wrench or pipe is a good option for some of the weaker foes, while stronger enemies will require beefier weaponry. Like most modern Nightdive games, gyro aiming is included for fine-tuning, but you can also tinker with its sensitivity in the options menu if you want a greater range of motion.</p>
<p>At various points during your stay at Citadel Station, you’ll also hack into Cyberspace terminals to access locked doors throughout each floor. The Cyberspace is a digital maze in which you fly around in first-person and shoot down colourful enemies. It’s a pretty psychedelic experience; one that Jeff Minter would be proud of, and the visuals on display are truly spectacular.</p>
<p>What’s even better is that these areas don’t outstay their welcome; the bulk of your time will be spent exploring the station, so when the Cyberspace sections do occasionally show up, they add a welcome dose of variety. Meanwhile, other puzzles on each floor are perhaps a bit closer to BioShock in their presentation, requiring you to rewire circuits to direct the flow of electricity and unlock new passageways. These are fun, if a bit throwaway.</p>

<p>I’d love to end the review there and urge you to buy System Shock on Switch 2; fundamentally, it’s a great remake that remains faithful to the original while introducing a host of improvements for modern audiences. Unfortunately, the frame rate is absolutely all over the place and it ruins the experience.</p>
<p>Nightdive is gunning for 60fps here, but it almost never reaches its goal, and the unlocked frame rate results in some frequent, heavy drops while exploring. It makes basic aiming feel off all the time, and although gyro helps stabilise it somewhat, it’s still nowhere near as smooth as it should be.</p>
<p>It’s especially frustrating when you consider that System Shock would be the perfect showcase for mouse controls on the Switch 2. You can toggle this option for both normal exploration and the Cyberspace sections, and in theory it works really well. There’s very minimal input lag which, compared to the disastrous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> port recently, is very welcome, while opening up the inventory screen immediately brings up an on-screen cursor to make management much easier.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161185/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, however, even with the mouse controls, the frame rate suffers from frequent hitches that make it near-impossible to aim accurately. You’ll pan the camera around to get an enemy in your sights, but when the game tries to manage all the background visual information, it instantly judders, causing you to completely overshoot your mark. It’s extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>Curiously, the Cyberspace sections run perfectly – a solid 60fps with no noticeable drops. This is great, but as I mentioned earlier, these jaunts are few and far between, so the vast majority of System Shock is, sadly, plagued by poor performance. To be doubly sure that it wasn't something iffy with my Switch 2, I transferred the game from the SD Express Card to the onboard memory – sadly, the issues remained unchanged, and a pre-release patch seemingly did nothing to smooth things out.</p>
<p>Coming from Nightdive, a team that prides itself on delivering slick gameplay experiences, this is a disappointing port, to say the least.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>System Shock is, on paper, a brilliant remake that thoughtfully updates the 1994 original for modern systems, introducing both gyro aiming and mouse support along with a host of graphical upgrades. Unfortunately, the move over to the Switch 2 has tanked the performance, resulting in a game that never feels satisfying enough to play.</p>
<p>Should this get fixed in the future, it may well be worth investigating, but for now, you'll be better off playing it on another platform.</p></section>

<p>Coming to Switch 1 &amp; 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nihon Falcom and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter">Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</a> is coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 in Fall 2026, around a year after the first.</p>
<p>That means those of you champing at the bit after <em>that</em> cliffhanger at the end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> (and the subsequent teaser after the credits roll), you don't have too long to wait. If you <em>haven't</em> played 1st Chapter and want to remain spoiler free, well... you should probably skip the trailer, and this story.</p>
<p>2nd Chapter kicks off pretty much right after the events of Estelle and Joshua's first adventure. After getting entangled with the secret society of Ouroboros and the Enforcers, Estelle must search for her adoptive brother and best friend Joshua after he runs away.</p>

<p>The young bracer will team up with familiar faces as well as gain a few new companions — though long-time fans will recognise a few of these newcomers. New foes will make an appearance, too, and you'll finally get to see more of Ouroboros, particularly after 1st Chapter.</p>
<p>The stakes are bigger, but this remake sticks to the same philosophy as the first; the beautiful 3D visuals and overhauled combat are back and present, as well as full English (and Japanese) voice acting.</p>

<p>So, after an extremely strong 2025 for Trails, 2026 is continuing the trend — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, the next mainline game in the series, is out in January 2026 (published by NIS), with 2nd Chapter being the second game release.</p>
<p>We've known about 2nd Chapter for a little while, as Falcom revealed its existence in its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-scheduled-for-2026-release">Financial Report in September</a>. But full confirmation of a release window is exactly what we wanted to close out the year.</p>

<p>15 years leads to big(Ben) payout</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2beae5d594c4c"><a title="Wii and Wii Remote" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2beae5d594c4c/wii-and-wii-remote.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been locked in a long-running legal battle with BigBen Interactive — now known as Nacon — over an infringement relating to the patent of the Wii controller for a full 15 years. That's a long time!</p>
<p>Now, though, and as reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/">The Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-wins-8m-in-15-year-old-lawsuit-over-wii-controller-patent">Games Industry.biz</a>), the Japanese giant has finally had success, resulting in a <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">"nearly EUR 7 million"</a> payout ($8.2million).</p>
<p>The judgment in the case, which was reached in October and concerns BigBen's third-party Wiimotes, took a remarkably long time, especially given that the court originally found BigBen guilty of patent infringement <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-before-the-mannheim-district-court">back in 2011</a>. The ruling does give Nacon the right to appeal, and that is something they are currently doing, having "delayed the proceedings several times, for example by rejecting the court-appointed expert", according to <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">the press release</a> put out by Nintendo's German legal team.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The same press release highlights how the case is unusual due to Nintendo's damages calculations being made under a "lost profits theory":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Particularly significant: the court assumed that Nintendo would have made 100% of the sales made by BigBen, without any deductions in view of third-party suppliers that were active in the market. BigBen had argued that buyers, had they not bought the BigBen products, would have opted for other third-party controllers that were available. However, the court found that these third-party products were also highly likely to infringe the patent-in-suit. Citing case law from the German Federal Court of Justice, it stated that hypothetical mitigating circumstances that would have amounted to third-party activities that also trigger damages could not be taken into account in favor of the infringer."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This case is also of particular note as it's been so long-running that the actual damages have increased by €3 million due to interest rates 5% higher than central bank rates. "These delaying tactics have now proved costly," say Nintendo's lawyers. <em>Ouch.</em></p>
<p>Nacon is appealing, but right now this is looking like a significant legal win for Nintendo.</p>
