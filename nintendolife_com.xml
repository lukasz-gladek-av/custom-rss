<figure><a title="Super Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/efa52e229e64b/super-mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's looking like it'll be a hot one this weekend, and while gaming may not be the first thing that comes to mind, you know we're all going to need some time chilling in the shade at some point.</p>
<p>Before we get into this week's What Are You Playing, let's recap the major news from the past seven days. The biggie was a tasty slice of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> info from a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">IGN</a> interview, where we learnt the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">director and producer</a>, its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-like-mario-kart-world-was-initially-planned-for-switch-1">Switch 1 origins</a>, and how the team got its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dk-bananza-devs-needed-to-know-more-about-donkey-kong-so-they-went-to-miyamoto">DK inspiration</a>. Only one week to go!</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was revealed that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">Switch Game Voucher scheme</a> will be wrapping up next year, we interrogated everyone's experiences with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-how-are-your-download-speeds-on-switch-2">Switch 2 download speeds</a>, shared our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/three-laps-two-players-one-vegas-jumpsuit-10-things-wed-love-to-see-added-to-mario-kart-world">wishes</a>, and witnessed the birth of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/crocs-launching-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing-out-next-month">Animal Crossing X Crocs collaboration</a> (insert cheers/boos here).</p>
<p>We also found time to review <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/misc-a-tiny-tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-air-combat-221">Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/missile-command-delta">Missile Command Delta</a>. <em>Phew</em>, we need a lie down after that.</p>
<p>Now then, let's have a look at what everyone's up to this weekend.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:184756,184745 @ 1752318097 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>It’s all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> this weekend. A few caveats aside, playing this collection was like that moment when Anton Ego tastes the ratatouille and is mentally transported back to his childhood. Wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>I’m keen to play a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>. Most of the time, when I’m done reviewing a game, it kinda just gets left on the dusty, digital shelf never to be played again, but there’s something about this game that keeps bringing me back. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm on a retro buzz this weekend. I've still got the Wii set up after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a> bender I went on a few months back, and I've been meaning to blast through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/batman_the_brave_and_the_bold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a> with the kids. With the DC vibes in the air at the moment, it seems like a perfect time. I also want to show them GameCube <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_jungle_beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> with the bongos, and once they're in bed, I've got half a mind to fire up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/sin_and_punishment_star_successor">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a>, a game I picked up in the last few years but didn't get around to playing properly.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>By the time you're reading this, folks, I'll be trekking up through the gorgeous hills and paths of the Isle of Skye. Not the most relaxing holiday, but maybe the most beautiful? I'll report back in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So, not much game time! But on the train rides from London, Edinburgh, and back to the south, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> is my trusty friend. Will I ever play anything else again? Well... you know what's coming next week. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Felix Sanchez, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This weekend, I intend to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trials_and_tribulations">Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations</a>! I'm at the last case, so I'm excited to see how it all wraps up after some brilliant cases in this third game.</p>
<p>I'm also probably gonna be playing some Mario Kart World, and practising some of the courses in time trials with my brother. And if I'm really feeling it, I'll free roam a bit around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which has piqued my interest with the Switch 2 edition.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still cracking on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, polishing off a few more Moons before my mind goes bananas next week, and it is <em>still</em> wonderful. It's been eight years, but I still have a little giggle every time I see Mario take control of a photo-realistic dinosaur, and I don't think I'll ever stop.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd like to squeeze in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon</a> to relive some of my PSP days and remind myself why it's taken me the best part of 20 years to get those damn chants out of my head.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Kamurochō is on fire as I step into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> Chapter 13. However, I made the silly mistake of making an avatar for the 30 fps World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. I was not expecting to be so hooked on this mode and will continue Chapter 8 as a mix-and-match of special moves and clothing accessories. The throwback lore of the series is delicious, I’ve even found a Final Fight arcade in an alley and fought Retsu from the original Street Fighter!</p>
<p>Super happy to be wrong about the western eShop availability of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_super_dimension_fortress_macross_ii">Arcade Archives Super Dimension Fortress MACROSS II</a>, which will ensure my arcade stick will see action over the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> is also super fun! I'll make sure to make some progress on that front as well, before everything inevitably goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> next week.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wilmot_works_it_out">Wilmot Works It Out</a>. I do like it when I have one VERY DRAMATIC game with EXTREMELY HIGH STAKES and another one that's more like "this frog needs to make a cup of tea!" Wilmot Works It Out was fantastic for calming my nerves on a plane journey after one cancellation and three delays, whereas Hundred Line is the second-slowest burn game I've played (after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_in_fata_morgana_dreams_of_the_revenants_edition">House in Fata Morgana</a>). It has a lot of lulls in-between story beats. But that's okay! I think it's about to blow up big time, anyway...</p>

<p>Launching in Japan this month</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef273953df9f5/ys-x-proud-nordics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nihon Falcom, NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2's packing a lot more horsepower than the original system, and as a result, a lot of games and series can now ship with higher resolutions and improved performance. With this in mind, the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> will apparently support up to 120fps on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>This information comes from Japanese outlet <a href="https://s.inside-games.jp/article/2025/07/11/169368.html">Inside Games (via RPG Site)</a>, with the source reporting there'll be a special mode to prioritise performance, where players can apparently experience "smoother movements" thanks to the higher frame rate. The default performance is said to be 60fps.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is scheduled to launch on the Switch in Japan at the end of this month and is an "upgraded version" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> including new story, settings and more. If we hear any significant updates or anything about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This follows the release of Ys X: Nordics locally last October on the Switch, with a demo also available on the eShop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it!</p>
<p>Bash through just about anything with the raw power of Donkey Kong! Crash through walls, carve tunnels with your fists, punch straight down into the ground, and even tear off chunks of terrain to swing around and throw in groundbreaking exploration—the more you smash, the more areas open up for you to move through.</p>
<p>Join DK and his companion, Pauline, as they delve deep underground—and discover that this subterranean world is a lot more than it seems on the surface. Uncover a variety of environments such as arid canyons, lush forests, and frigid tundra as you peel back the world’s layers!</p>

<p>Speaking to Bloomberg, co-director (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> creator) Kazutaka Kodaka has revealed the title is "selling pretty well" at this point, and although no figures are attached, he goes on to mention how he no longer sees "bankruptcy as a serious future" for the team.

<p>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy made its debut in April and is currently a Switch console exclusive, with the title also available on Valve's Steam service for PC. The developer has already spoken about how it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-hundred-line-director-has-insanely-ambitious-ideas-for-the-game">some ridiculously ambitious ideas</a> for the game going forward, but it was all riding on the success of its launch.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">we reviewed The Hundred Line here</a> on Nintendo Life, we called it an "excellent" tactical RPG with a well-written and compelling story, as well as strong and strategic gameplay, an attractive art style, and passionate voice work. So, if you're a fan of this kind of experience, it's well worth a look.</p>
