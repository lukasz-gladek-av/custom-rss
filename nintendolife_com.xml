<p>It released Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</p>

<figure><a title="Oblivion Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e357206c5fb75/oblivion-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bethesda, Virtuos</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">Switch port specialist Virtuos</a> – known within the Nintendo space for its work on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> – has officially laid off 270 employees across its studios worldwide.</p>
<p>This is "approximately 7%" of the company's "global workforce", with 200 roles in Asia and 70 roles in Europe axed, "primarily in teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts" in the game industry.</p>
<p>The latest update follows the surprise release of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">Oblivion Remastered</a> (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/05/xbox-tops-the-list-in-new-best-selling-games-roundup-for-the-us">which seemingly got off to a great start</a>) on other platforms earlier this year, and the company specifically notes how these layoffs include "fewer than 10 in France", where this core team is located.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/news/adapting-for-the-future-of-game-development/">blog on the Virtuos website</a> titled "Adapting For The Future Of Game Development", the company went into detail about how it intends to evolve and realign its structure to strengthen its "high-value co-development":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Virtuos is evolving to meet the changing needs of our partners and the industry. As game development grows increasingly complex, we are realigning our global footprint and capabilities to strengthen our offering in high-value co-development, ranging from full game engineering to advanced art, including creative content production and live services."</p>
<p>"...Over the past 12 months, Virtuos has deepened its commitment to premium co-development through key acquisitions of Beyond-FX, Pipeworks, and Umanaïa in North America, as well as Third Kind Games and Abstraction in Europe. These studios enhance our strengths in VFX, design, Unreal Engine programming, and creative development. This ongoing investment reflects our intent to grow in areas where our expertise and scale create lasting value, while selectively exiting service segments where demand is weakening. We need to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development. This alignment is why the current reorganization has a greater impact on our teams in Asia."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos says it's "grateful for the contributions of those impacted" and will be providing separation packages along with career transition assistance, and opportunities for "redeployment" within its global network where possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's promised it remains "fully committed" to its partnerships, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/12/more-cyberpunk-2077-updates-could-be-coming-as-cdpr-enlists-outside-help-for-patch-2-2">including its "ongoing work"</a> on titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. This news follows Microsoft laying off over 9,000 employees earlier this month, including staff under the Xbox division.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Video: Switch 2 Vs. Steam Deck System Face-Off, Digital Foundry Investigates]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-switch-2-vs-steam-deck-system-face-off-digital-foundry-investigates</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Digital Foundry has returned with a new "system face-off" video – this time putting Nintendo's hybrid hardware, the Switch 2, up against Valve's PC handheld, the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the video above, you can see how the Switch 2 holds up against the Steam Deck OLED model across various "head-to-head" match-ups, including battery life, form factor, controller design, as well as OS and software availability.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie acknowledges how there are some obvious similarities, but also notes how these are two very different systems at the end of the day. Here are his closing thoughts, if you don't get the chance to watch the full video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think the Switch 2 is better as a console-like device than the Steam Deck is. It offers a streamlined, stress-free experience for playing controller-oriented games, the OS is rock solid, it docks perfectly, and it has great exclusive games - it's a more enjoyable, delightful machine to use moment to moment, if you want a slick gaming experience, it's hard to go wrong here, but it doesn't have the flexibility of a PC handheld, it can't access thousands upon thousands of PC games, you can't add special launch parameters, change up settings, swap refresh rates, or check out performance overlays, and you don't have the control options to make cursor oriented software work on the go. So, each machine has its strengths.</p>
<p>"The Switch 2 is a great machine to enjoy a game like Cyberpunk 2077 or exclusives like Mario Kart World or Fast Fusion, but a game like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 benefits enormously from having trackpad input, and the deck can play a larger vaiety of software, including older games that will probably never get a Switch 2 release. It's kind of an intractable battle, a fight between a console and essentially a PC in a console suit. Personal preferences and priorities are going to dictate this one, but I think most gamers will find a lot to like in both devices."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it comes down to what's best for you, along with your personal preferences, according to Digital Foundry. If you're eager to see more, Digital Foundry has also done comparisons of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and investigated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-digital-foundry-tests-switch-2s-gamecube-emulation">Switch 2's GameCube emulation</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>My first gaming memory: waking up in the middle of the night, heading downstairs, and booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_superstar_baseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a>'s campaign mode on my GameCube.</p>
<p>It was completely out of character, according to my parents, who still tell the story of my midnight gambit to this day. I had never dared transgress the norms of bedtime before, but my love for Mario and his cadre of ball-playing desperados drew me there – in front of the television in the wee hours of the morning, having the time of my life playing my favourite game. I was six. It was 2005.</p>
<p>Mario Superstar Baseball is reviewed as a completely mediocre game across the board. An ancillary Nintendo sports title developed primarily by Namco and released in the fog of the GameCube's dying breath. Yet it deserves its moment in the spotlight for its ability to show sports kids what makes Mario fun, in a gentle and approachable way. It made video games accessible to those of us in the mid-2000s whose inner nerds waited patiently just beneath the surface. For that reason, Mario Superstar Baseball is more than a nostalgia trip. It's a connector that encourages players old and new to come out of their shells (blue, red, green, or otherwise) and explore the colourful world of games.</p>

<p>When you isolate its core mechanics, Mario Superstar Baseball is pretty close to a rhythm game. Fielding is mostly automated, outside of a few button presses and the option to control players as they race to get underneath pop flies. Thus, the overwhelming majority of gameplay is spent performing baseball’s two other essential functions: pitching and batting.</p>
<p>To pitch, you aim over the plate with the sticks before holding and releasing the 'A' button on time with your character’s specific pitch motion. Part of the game’s nuance is perfecting the timing of these motions across different characters while learning the little tricks that come along with tossing change-ups, curveballs, and special pitches that make use of your character’s “Star Power.” Pro tip: Even though Kamek doesn’t come to mind off the bat as a dominant athlete among the roster of Mario characters included, this Magikoopa’s change-ups rank among the most brutal salvos the game has to offer. Have a go – you’ll be impossible to hit in no time.</p>

<p>Batting, on the other hand, is all about subtle choices. Beginners will charge up their swings by holding 'A' before each pitch, but doing so can throw off your timing, especially on fast balls. What’s more, a lot of skill-based characters, like Daisy and Luigi, are optimised around getting on base with a single button tap at the right time rather than hitting home runs with a supercharged cut at the ball.</p>
<p>Therefore, mastering the art of the bat also requires getting to know each character in your lineup. Knowing how to react when it's Shy Guy’s turn in the order versus a power hitter like Bowser or Donkey Kong constitutes a large part of Mario Superstar Baseball’s catalytic joy. Each character’s play style matches their personality and special traits.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> titles might get all the hype these days, especially in this new era of the Switch 2, Mario Superstar Baseball should not be forgotten, as it is a key example of what Nintendo wants to do with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-sports-games-of-all-time">Mario Sports</a> titles. That is, to provide a whimsical on-ramp for new fans to access the joys of the franchise while staying true enough to its roots to delight even those disciples that have enjoyed Mario since the Jump Man days. If you’re ever looking for more blasts from the past in this same vein, have a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a> for the DS (<strong>Mario Slam Basketball</strong> in Europe). Oddly enough, it was developed in collaboration with Square Enix and thus features characters from the Mushroom Kingdom competing against mainstays from the Final Fantasy franchise. A true handheld treat!</p>

<p>Speaking of handhelds, now that the Switch 2 has hit store shelves, Nintendo has managed to reclaim the video game industry spotlight. Every time they release a new console, I can’t help but think back to my favorite hardware from the Nintendo canon – and that frosty night back in 2005, just before New Year’s, when I crawled out of bed and braved the pitch darkness so that I could play a few more delightful innings with Mario and friends.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo and the gaming world at large appear to have all but moved on from Mario Superstar Baseball — especially since the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Super Sluggers</a> for the Wii and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_sports_superstars">Mario Sports Superstars</a> for the 3DS — it’s essential to look back at what makes this game and its quirky little cube-shaped console special as we move into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>While I hope Nintendo does continue to innovate, I also enjoy keeping the lamp lit for less heralded titles from its past that have made a difference larger than the sum of their parts, mediocre reviews and all. Mario Superstar Baseball is one such title, and a reboot in this era of gaming could have the potential to bring us all back to a simpler time. A time when twangy harmonica music played us into a pristine cutscene of Mario making an athletic play at his home stadium, finding a flyer from Bowser challenging his crew for the title of best baseball team in town, and questing from ballpark to ballpark all in the name of good fun and weird minigames. With nothing on the line that a secret midnight foray into the family room couldn’t fix.</p>
