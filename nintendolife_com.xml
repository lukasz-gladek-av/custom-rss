<p>No twist of fate</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the big hour-long Nintendo Direct, Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> got a release date for Switch 2! And it's landing on the console on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The game was revealed back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/capcoms-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-for-switch-2">July's Partner Showcase</a> and has received a huge glow-up from its lovely-looking predecessors. But this is more of that charming turn-based Monster Hunter action we've seen on 3DS and Switch.</p>
<p>In the brand new trailer, there's a revelation: twin monsters are "a portent of disaster" and we've got twin Rathalos(es?) on our hands. One of them is yours and you'll be riding them around the world as you tame Monsties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While new details are sparse, we do have a rundown of the game from its Steam page, so check that out if you need a refresher:</p>
<p>Embark on a new adventure in the third installment of the turn-based RPG series set in the world of Monster Hunter! Become a Rider in the Monster Hunter Stories series as you hatch and build kinship with friendly monsters known as Monsties, then explore and battle alongside them in a world full of potential!</p>
<p>Set two centuries after a conflict that divided neighboring kingdoms, the drums of war are reignited as twin Rathalos—long thought extinct—hatch from a single egg: an omen of destruction.</p>
<p>Two kingdoms, two Riders, and two Rathalos; their fates now intertwined. As calamity encroaches, seek hope beyond the border and into forbidden lands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 is coming to Switch 2 in March 2026 — ready to ride Rathalos into the skies? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Another free upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the gift that just keeps on giving — just a few weeks after ConcernedApe announced it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">working on a 1.7 update</a>, today's Nintendo Direct also unveiled a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of the beloved farming sim.</p>
<p>And of course, the upgrade is 100% free too. Plus, it includes Mouse Mode controls, which will make decorating your house and farm <em>so</em> much easier.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition isn't just about the mouse, though. Four-player split-screen multiplayer and eight-player online multiplayer is also coming.</p>
<p><em>And</em> just in case you still didn't think Stardew was great value, you can now use GameShare to play with up to up to three others if they don't have the game. And yes, it works with Switch 1 and Switch 2. That's pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley is already one of the best games on Switch, and it's easily one of the best farm sims of all time. We can't wait to lose our life to this again on Switch 2. It might be time for a new co-op farm...</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to the Switch 2 Edition in the comments</em>.</p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>it's not even out yet, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is <em>already</em> getting DLC, and it was announced during today's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension</a> doesn't have a release date yet, but it looks to focus on the Pokémon Hoopa and features two brand new Mega Evolutions for Raichu — Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y.</p>
<p>Hoopa is apparently opening up dimensions across Lumiose City. What that means for our intrepid trainer? No idea, but we bet we'll get hoop-ing (sorry) in to find out.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the only Z-A news we got today. Just before that, we got <a href="https://youtu.be/PPTqA10lt-c?si=Wl_17ewBg7a7QQF0">a little peek at three new Mega Evolutions</a>, and they're for the Kalos Starter Trio.</p>
<p>Yep, Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja are all getting their own Mega. <em>Finally</em><em>.</em> You'll need to earn a Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite via the Z-A Battle Club in order to see them, but they're excellent evolutions of their original class-based designs.</p>
<p>However, the kicker is that they're only available via <em>online</em> Ranked Battles. According to the press release, "Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite stones cannot normally be obtained during regular gameplay. Mega Stones obtainable as promotion rewards are planned to be redistributed in future seasons." So that's a bit of a bummer.</p>

<p>We've already seen a brand new Mega Evolution in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pokemon-legends-z-a-unveils-a-newly-discovered-mega-evolution">Mega Malamar earlier this week</a>, so with this batch of five newbies, we're swimming in new battle opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of these new Megas in the comments below!</em></p>
