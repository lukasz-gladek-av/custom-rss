<p>Live on Kickstarter now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/rune_factory_4">Rune Factory 4</a> director Shinichi Manabe is currently hard at work creating a new farming sim alongside writer Takanori Tsuji, and it's now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1005170304/farnia-village/description">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Farnia Village</strong> is currently eyeing a release on Steam, but Manabe-san also states that a console release may be on the cards at some point in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game is being optimized to run comfortably on hardware comparable to the Nintendo Switch, which means it should perform well on most laptops. Looking ahead, we hope to bring the game to home consoles in the future, if possible."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The big hook (if you can really call it that) for Farnia Village is that you can continue living in its world long after you've completed the main quest. You'll be tending to your crops, looking after animals, forging relationships with the local residents, and more. In short, it's a farming sim through and through.</p>
<p>As for the release date, well... it sounds like it's quite a ways off, at the moment. The earliest delivery date listed in the pledges is 'September 2027', but some of them even state 'September 2028', so who knows. We won't be seeing this one for a while yet, and it's possible a console release could be even further out.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter is creeping toward its ¥5,000,000 goal (roughly £24,845) with another 29 days to go. Stretch goals include extra characters more dungeons and crops, and additional music tracks. If this all sounds good to you, then consider checking out the full campaign when you have a moment.</p>

<p>Yes, as spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/upachan64" tabindex="-1">@upachan64</a> (thanks, <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/news/lanky-kong-and-chunky-kong-head-to-dk-bananza/">Gaming Reinvented</a>), both Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong appear to be entering the fray as unlockable figures. This comes via the Japanese version of the Switch 2 news app, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this event, you can obtain figures of Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong from Donkey Kong 64. Just like Enguarde and the others, these are exclusive items that can only be obtained here, so please join in!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4npkrji&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>It goes without saying that you'll need the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> DLC to access the in-game events. As for this one, judging from the screenshots attached the news piece, it looks like it'll be taking place on the Hilltop Layer, one of the earlier locations in Bananza.</p>
<p>Chances are we'll be getting an official announcement here in the west very soon, so we'll be sure to let you know as soon as it happens.</p>
<p>Either way, yay! The boys are coming back! Kind of, sort of...</p>

<p>An epic RPG adventure awaits, Hero</p>

<figure data-uuid="6ee2b1102b66a"><a title="Dragon Quest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ee2b1102b66a/dragon-quest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's an incredibly exciting week for old school RPG fans, with Square Enix releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> on the Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms. This reimagined package comes loaded with not only the trademark HD-2D visuals, but also new features, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-remakes-brand-new-underwater-region-is-beautiful">new locations and new story content</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of our own review going live later today, the very first critic review has now been shared online. As usual, it comes from the famous Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/">Famitsu</a>. So, what is the final verdict?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxyhwg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>This follow-up to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, which is also part of The Erdrick Trilogy, has officially received a score of <strong>9/9/8/8</strong> from the four critics, giving the game a total score of <strong>34/40</strong> (<a href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/92274">Ryokutya2089 via Gematsu</a>). And if you're wondering, the remake of the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/famitsu-review-scores-issue-1874">third game received</a> 8/9/9/9, adding up to a final score of 35/40.</p>
<p>So, that's the score from Famitsu for Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. If you're planning to get this game on the Switch or Switch 2, just remember that there's no upgrade path for this one. The Switch 2 version is also a Game-Key Card release.</p>

<p>Here's a teaser...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>There was recently news about the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a></strong> getting a demo on select platforms, and ahead of Halloween, it's now officially available on the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>You'll apparently be able to access the first levels of the game as SpongeBob and Patrick, and also some new abilities (thanks, Nintendo Everything). In general, you'll also be able to get an idea of what to expect before the full release next month on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Above is a trailer of the demo and below we have some PR about the story and adventure SpongeBob and Patrick will go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em><strong>Prepare to be scared – in the most nautical nonsense kind of way!</strong> When the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune’s egos collide, the result is pure undersea chaos: spectral mayhem spreads across Bikini Bottom, and only two brave(ish) heroes can set things right. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up, combine their unique skills, and (hopefully) stop the total ghostification of their world. From the depths of Neptune’s Palace to the icy peaks of Mount Bikini, fans will explore iconic locations, face epic bosses, and first and foremost: have F.U.N!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's been no official mention of a Switch release, so for now, this game remains exclusive to Switch 2 on Nintendo platforms.</p>

<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="bb4dfbf579a54"><a title="Microsoft CEO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb4dfbf579a54/microsoft-ceo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last month, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">reiterated how Xbox would support Switch 2</a> and PlayStation 5 players going forward, and now the tech giant's Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella has chimed in.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142">Speaking to TBPN recently</a> about this "shifting" business model, Nadella mentioned how the company wants to be a "fantastic publisher" on every platform now that the Activision acquisition is complete and it's the "largest publisher" in the business.</p>
<p>He also compared this approach to the one Windows took with Microsoft Office. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now we are the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher - similar approach to what we did with Office, we want to be everywhere in every platform, so we want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the pc, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming, or the TV, so we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this expansion to more devices and platforms, Microsoft is still <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/huge-xbox-report-details-ambitious-next-gen-console-with-free-online-play">reportedly going ahead with its own next-generation</a> gaming plans, which will supposedly blur the lines between PC and Xbox. Nadella also seemingly backed up these reports in his latest interview while claiming Microsoft and gaming's biggest competition was no longer "other" gaming, but "short form video".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming [platforms], gaming's competition is short form video. And so if we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model - [the] best way to innovate is to have good margins because that's the way you can fund."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These comments from Microsoft's CEO follow Xbox's huge announcement last week that it would be bringing <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo</a></strong> to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/halo-confirmed-for-ps5-remake-of-first-game-out-in-2026?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">PlayStation for the first time</a>. On the Nintendo front, the Bethesda games <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a></strong> (IP now under Microsoft's banner) are both on the way to the Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

<p>According to the official patch notes on Nintendo's support page, Version 1.1.4 addresses "several issues" to improve gameplay on the new hybrid hardware. Nintendo doesn't go into the specifics, but if we hear anything, we'll let you know. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 1.1.4 (Released October 28, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2. Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<hr>
<p>This is actually Super Mario 3D All-Stars' third update this year. The previous two versions (1.1.3 and 1.1.2) have the same patch notes as the latest game patch. Again, if we find out what's going on here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Although patches are still being released for this game, keep in mind it's no longer available to purchase on the eShop and was available for a "limited-time" in stores. It contains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> game.</p>
<p>This update also happens to follow the recent release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> at the beginning of October. You can find out more about this new (<em>but old</em>) two-in-one release in our recent Nintendo Life review.</p>
