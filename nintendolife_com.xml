<p>Bandai Namco's fighting game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> made its way across to the Switch and Switch 2 late last year, and this week, it receives a new update for these platforms.</p>
<p>The Japanese company has outlined what to expect on its official website. This update includes multiple changes and adjustments to game modes - starting with a new "limited-time mode" called Extreme Warrior Attack. In this mode, players will battle characters with "significantly increased strength".</p>
<p>Apart from this, in the "Battle Together" Versus mode, all stages can now be selected. Just make sure you're playing on Switch 2 to access this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>All stages become selectable only when either the Nintendo Switch™ 2 version or the Nintendo Switch™ version is played on a Nintendo Switch™ 2 console with the update data applied.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also some other changes and adjustments in this update. This includes new selectable scenarios, cut scenes, and text options in the Custom Battle mode. And last, but not least, Bandai Namco says this update has apparently "improved usability and overall system stability" when playing on Nintendo's platforms.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, a new "major" DLC for Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO was announced last month. It will add more playable characters, new stages, and a new single-player mode. More details about the Switch 2 and Switch versions of this DLC (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/bandai-namco-announces-new-dragon-ball-game-project-age-1000">and other planned content</a>) will be shared in the future. For now, here's a look, and below this is the roadmap for 2026, outlining what else is on the way.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco has also announced it's currently working on a new Dragon Ball project, and it's currently set to arrive in "2027".</p>

<p>Bethesda has surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> fans on the Switch 2 this week with a new update, which adds a "60Hz mode" and allows players to prioritise either the game's visuals or performance. The frame rate has also been locked to 30Hz in the visual mode, and the patch improves other aspects, such as the FPS performance drops in certain areas of the game.</p>
<p>The tech comparison <a href="https://youtu.be/Op5s6dTuod4">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has now taken a look at Update 1.2 - sharing a side-by-side video of the visual mode running alongside the game's performance mode. In some scenes, it's also shared footage of the existing update (Version 1.1, which was limited to 30fps).</p>
<p>While it might not look quite as impressive as it does in the visual mode, as you can see, the performance mode makes the experience smoother. According to this same video comparison, the game aims for 60fps in this mode, and while there is a solid frame rate in some segments, it can also be seen slightly dipping from time to time.</p>

<p>In terms of the compromises in performance mode, there appears to be less detail in terms of shadows and foliage. Other more noticeable things include more pop-in. Still, if you haven't already tried out this mode, it is worth a look, and might just end up being the mode you prefer playing on.</p>
<p>If you're still not sure if now is a good time to revisit (or jump into this title) on the Switch 2, we've shared our own <a href="https://youtu.be/0oU8yjp-m2Y">comparison video on Nintendo Life</a>, which you can see in our previous story covering the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/bethesda-releases-skyrim-update-1-2-for-switch-2-includes-60hz-mode-and-much-more">patch notes for Skyrim's Update 1.2</a> (or just scroll down).</p>
