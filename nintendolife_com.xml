<figure data-uuid="241592c9e02ce"><a title="Virtual Boy Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/241592c9e02ce/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Virtual Boy app for Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack launched this week, giving many Nintendo fans the very first chance to play these games in an official capacity.</p>
<p>Some older die-hards may have an original VB knocking around or might have sampled its monochrome delights sometime over the last 30 years, but for many players — especially in Europe, where the system never launched — this is likely their first taste of Nintendo's <em>other</em> Boy.</p>
<p>Yes, we all know this curio was a commercial failure, but its slight library still contains worthwhile experiences, and the promise of more games (including two that were completed but shelved and have languished in Nintendo's vault for three decades) makes NSO an ideal venue to dip into the catalogue without forking out for original hardware. Granted, at $99.99 / £66.99, the VB Switch accessory isn't cheap either, but an original Virtual Boy in decent, working order will set you back <em>a lot</em> more than that.</p>

<p>At launch, there are seven games, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-games-list-every-nintendo-classics-retro-game-on-nso-plus-expansion-pack#upcoming-nso-virtual-boy-games-9">a further nine</a> scheduled throughout 2026 (including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/marios_tennis">Mario's Tennis</a>, the first entry in that long-running series):</p>

<p>We've got retro reviews written in the early 2010s for all of the games above, but we're keen to get your thoughts from a 2026 perspective. Now you've had the opportunity to play these games, what review score would you give them? Let us know how the launch batch fares for you in the polls below.</p>







<hr>
<p><em>Thanks for the ranks. If you haven't had a chance to give them all a thorough play just yet (hey, they only dropped yesterday!), you can rate them as usual via their individual game pages whenever you like, and the polls above also appear at the bottom of our retro reviews.</em></p>
<p><em>We'll be publishing the resulting dynamic, real-time ranking of the VB Nintendo Classics line soon, but if you just can't wait, you can check out the order as things stand in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-virtual-boy-games">our ranked list of all 22 Virtual Boy games</a>, NSO or no.</em></p>
<p><em>And as always, let us know if you're enjoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFIrKWg89r4">seeing red</a> in the usual place.<br></em></p>

<p>Amy Mars? Veronica Rose?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="92a82647796ce"><a title="Sonic the Hedgehog Amy Rose &amp; Kristen Bell" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/92a82647796ce/sonic-the-hedgehog-amy-rose-and-kristen-bell.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The next <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> movie is set to be a big one, with even more classic characters coming back, one of which is everyone's favourite pink hedgehog, Amy Rose. And we now know which Hollywood star will be voicing the iconic character</p>
<p>Revealed by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Kristen Bell, best known from <strong>Veronica Mars</strong>, <strong>Frozen</strong>, <strong>The Good Place</strong>, and <strong>Gossip Girl</strong>, will be taking up the piko piko hammer.</p>
<p>She'll be joining Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and Keanu Reeves (Shadow) — assuming these all return — among many other star-studded names, when <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</strong> speeds onto cinema screens on 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>In fact, Schwartz shared a rather adorable photo of the pair on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6JVK4lBLA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">his instagram account</a> earlier today, accompanied by this sweet little celebration: "WE HAVE OUR AMY ROSE!!! And I could not be more excited!!! Please welcome the incredible @kristenanniebell to the @sonicmovie family!!!"</p>

<p>Amy was expected to appear in fourth Sonic movie after a very brief cameo during <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</strong>. Metal Sonic is also rumoured after he featured during the same cameo, but we don't have an official announcement for his return yet.</p>
<p>And it seems like everyone is coming back for the sequel: Jeff Fowler will remain in the director's chair, while Neal H. Moritz and Toby Ascher of Original Films and Toru Nakahara are also on-board as producers.</p>
<p>And the Sonic series isn't stopping at another numbered movie, either. Late last year, Variety reported that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/new-sonic-universe-movie-spin-off-announced-for-2028">a new 'Sonic Universe' spin-off is in the works for 2028</a>. So the blue blur is steadily becoming a multi-media monster.</p>
