<p>But it's far from its best</p>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/408174">Game Biz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/xenoblade-dev-monolith-soft-sees-19-profit-increase/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the company recorded profits of 487 million yen during the last financial year, which is up from 409 million yen the year prior. During this period, of course, Monolith developed and released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch, meaning that every core Xenoblade title is now available on one system.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82txmwko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10LJgMQyAc" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Monolith is also known for its extensive contributions to other Nintendo properties, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the increase, this isn't the best performance from Monolith Soft – far from it. According to the graph below, the company's highest performance came in 2021, during which it achieved nearly 1,200 million yen in profit.</p>

<p>Speaking of healthy numbers, reports have also been circulating to suggest that <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/01/nintendo-has-now-sold-over-5-million-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-worldwide/">Nintendo has now sold 5 million Switch 2 consoles</a> since its launch. These come via updated figures on Nintendo's official investor site, but this has since been removed. It isn't completely clear whether what the figure represents, but it's likely to be projected sales that Nintendo had mistakenly posted on its site.</p>

<p>Both companies deny the claims</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 - Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/828e1a69f9b85/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you found yourself trying to pick up a Switch 2 across the pond in recent months, then it will be old news to you that the console, and many first-party games prior to it, was not available <em>directly</em> through Amazon US. It felt like a baffling omission, but a recent report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) might give some explanation of why this was the case — even if the two companies involved have denied it.</p>
<p>Bloomberg spoke to "a person familiar with the situation" to try to get to the bottom of why Amazon US missed out on hosting Nintendo sales of its own, and it reportedly all comes down to a sales dispute between the companies around how the online storefront handles its third-party sellers.</p>
<p>According to the report, Nintendo pulled Amazon US' official sales privileges after clocking that "unauthorised sales" were appearing on the site, undercutting Nintendo's prices. The anonymous source claimed that select sellers were bulk-buying Nintendo products in Southeast Asia, before flogging them at a reduced rate on Amazon US.</p>
<p>The storefront apparently offered to attach labels guaranteeing a product's authenticity, but Nintendo instead opted to pull all of its official sales from the site, leaving only those sold by third parties.</p>
<p>Now, as we said right from the jump, both Nintendo and Amazon US deny these claims. "There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers," a Nintendo spokesperson told Bloomberg. The Amazon spokesperson similarly stated that "the claims made by Bloomberg regarding our relationship with Nintendo are inaccurate," though there are no specifics about <em>how</em> they are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Last year, it appeared that Nintendo's so-called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/amazon-appears-to-be-directly-selling-first-party-switch-games-again-us">"freeze-out" of Amazon US was coming to an end</a>, as copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> began to crop up on the site with Amazon listed as the seller. But months on, very little seems to have changed. You can still find first-party Nintendo products a-plenty on regional Amazon stores like the UK, Canadian, and Japanese sites, but the lion's share of US listings still come from third-party sellers.</p>
<p>For now, it seems, you're still better off braving the likes of Best Buy, Target, GameStop and Walmart in the US if you want to ensure the Nintendo guarantee.</p>
