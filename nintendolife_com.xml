<p>Universities and hospitals: they’re well-known money spinners (assuming you ignore socialised healthcare) and make perfect sense for a management sim. What doesn’t strike me as such a lucrative institution is a museum. I went to a lot of them as a child specifically because it was a cheap day out, and as I rocket closer towards middle age, I finally appreciate my parents’ mentality.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s not the theme I expected from the third Two Point game before it was announced, and my initial reaction was one more of confusion and minor pessimism than anything else, partly for the reasons previously mentioned. More fool me, though, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> may well be the most balanced and well-rounded of the lot.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159799/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’re the curator of a museum, or rather several museums, and it’s your job to pull in the punters, make the staff do their job, and secure new exhibits to make it all worth everyone’s while. You’ll not be making it an affordable day out, either; your museums are a <em>business</em> first and foremost, and that means staff can take one short break every month or so, and keyrings from the gift shop will cost patrons 50 quid a pop.</p>
<p>So far, so similar to previous entries, but one of the big changes this time around is exhibits and, more specifically, how to get them. You’ll have to send your staff through a helicopter-shaped rabbit hole where they set off to explore wherever it is you’ve told them to go, in the hope that they’ll not return dead (or worse, with a poor-quality exhibit).</p>
<p>Despite never really seeing where your staff members go on these expeditions, Two Point Museum still manages to instil a sense of exploration, all whilst safely hovering aloft your roofless enterprise.</p>
<p>This goes doubly so when staff encounter a random dilemma during such a trip, where a situation demands your expert decision-making. They might find what appears to be an oasis in the desert, and you have to decide if they should pursue it or stay on course.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159792/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As this is a Two Point game, your natural reaction and sensible thinking have to go out the window in these instances. That oasis? Actually a spa with a full staff wondering why they get so few customers. I’ll be honest, even though the game makes a foreboding sound whenever a dilemma occurs, I was absolutely thrilled each and every time, because it’s genuinely impossible to know what the outcome might be the first time around. Two Point Museum operates on a twisted, almost uncanny logic that continually delights and surprises.</p>
<p>The type of museum you run makes a substantial difference as well. The game will bounce you around the different museums available to you in order to progress, and each (initially) plays very differently from one another.</p>
<p>Depending on what you’re trying to discover, you’ll have to send your staff out to dig up dinosaur bones, catch fish to put in the aquariums you probably should have already built, dive deep into the bowels of an old technology centre, or, you know, dip into the netherworld to extract ghosts for children to gawk at. You can even take your helicopter into space. Amazing.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159791/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some exhibits you can simply plonk down, others require you to find their constituent parts, some need to be put in their own special rooms (think fish and ghosts), and some need to be kept in a specific level of humidity, temperature, or both.</p>
<p>Did I mention plants? I don’t think I did. These aren’t your garden variety botanicals, though; the plants people want to see are man-eaters, although in fairness the guests they eat don’t seem to die, only come out…changed. Some guests even demand this as their idea of a perfect museum visit. Why not dive headfirst into a gaping, vegetative maw so you can seemingly have your genetics altered to look like a clown? That’s a Batman story we haven’t yet seen.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep guests happy, as not only will they pay a frankly staggering amount to gain entry, but also will freely dump sometimes hundreds into your appropriately-positioned donation stands. How much they donate is based on an exhibit’s ‘buzz’, how much detail your information stands divulge (which can be increased by destroying and analysing an exhibit in a special room), how entertained they are, and several other factors besides.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159797/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And you’ll need to satisfy those, as donations make up a substantial part of your income. Entry tickets are a one-time thing, but donations can just keep coming and coming, and it’s never dissatisfying to see your stands bursting with golden coins to collect.</p>
<p>If all this seems a bit hard to get a grip on, then that’s reassuring, because the game is absolutely <em>rammed</em> with mechanics and twists on the basics. It eases you in, though, which is absolutely necessary, even if it can feel a touch basic at first. New mechanics and themes are drip-fed to you as you progress, meaning you don't get a chance to get bored doing the same thing time and time again.</p>
<p>It’s a meaty game too, easily demanding upwards of 50 hours for the base game, and the Fantasy Finds DLC will no doubt take that further still. Although it will be available on Switch 2, it sadly wasn’t live during our time pre-release. Further expanding what’s on offer is the Digiverse map of expeditions, which was released recently on other platforms as well. This map expands the exhibits you can acquire to include those from other games (currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>), with the promise of more to come.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159793/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tantalising stuff! And that’s not just my opinion, either. Bands of thieves and vandals, some of whom are from competing museums, are desperate to come in and either damage your hard-won treasures or take them for themselves. This is one of the trickier mechanics to master at first, as suddenly your security guards have more to do than empty the giant buckets of cash your guests have filled up.</p>
<p>Two Point Museum is a game that just keeps on giving. Every time you think you’ve got all the mechanics under your belt, the game tosses you another, like portals opening up and letting malevolent spirits in to harass your guests, or whoops! Now you have to tackle marketing campaigns!</p>
<p>The customisation is similarly excellent. You can freely build and modify not only each room in a museum, but each and every building as well (with one or two exceptions, of course). The floors, walls, partitions, dividers, and even the colour of individual decorations, it’s all up to you how it looks. Does it make a difference to how the game plays? Not even slightly, but I still caught myself spending cumulative hours fiddling around with floor tiles and decorative items’ positioning.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159795/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And to top it all off, Two Point Museum continues the trend of an excellent soundtrack interspersed with properly chuckle-worthy chatter from its resident DJs, wonderfully clear and vibrant visuals, and really fantastically executed controls for the genre.</p>
<p>One thing is notably missing on Switch 2, though, and that’s mouse mode. It seems like an obvious inclusion, but sadly it’s not included here at launch. We did speak to the developers recently, who confirmed that they are considering it, but right now it’s controller or nothing.</p>
<p>Visually, it’s a big step up over Switch 1’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/two_point_campus">Campus</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/two_point_hospital">Hospital</a>, although the game is capped at 30fps. It’s a very smooth 30fps in the early stages of each museum, but unfortunately it does struggle a bit as things get more hectic, and it seems to be the same in both docked and handheld for the most part. It’s not a dealbreaker per se, but given the leap to much more powerful hardware, I was hoping that it might be a little more consistent than it is, given that the game runs far better on other systems like the Steam Deck and Xbox Series S.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159794/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It just feels like there’s performance that’s been left on the table in its current state. I also experienced a few graphical anomalies, such as dust clouds being made entirely out of 2D squares, and one particular sandy floor texture going absolutely bananas and flashing terribly unless the camera was stock still.</p>
<p>I have faith that these little issues can be ironed out in updates — and a little more optimisation to get some more stability wouldn’t go amiss either — even if they don’t do anything to spoil the game.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Two Point Museum might be the best Two Point game to date. It’s smart, funny, good-looking, and packs in more mechanics than you can shake a stick at, all without feeling overwhelming or too much to handle.</p>
<p>It’s got some performance-based blemishes on Switch 2, and the lack of a mouse mode at launch feels like an obvious omission. Still, the final package is an incredibly entertaining one that fans of management sims would be mad to skip.</p></section>

<p>"Nintendo has continually dominated with outstanding games"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="9d804492cc0a7"><a title="Halo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9d804492cc0a7/halo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/introducing-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo Waypoint</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Xbox has been making headlines recently with the news that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> would be making its way to the PS5 in addition to Xbox Series X|S. Halo had always seemed like the last bastion of exclusivity for Microsoft's platform, and now that it's going multi-platform in 2026, it really seems like all bets are off.</p>
<p>To really drive the point home, Xbox president Sarah Bond recently said that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/xbox-boss-believes-sonys-strategy-of-console-exclusives-is-antiquated">console exclusives is an "antiquated" concept</a>, noting that the "biggest games in the world are available everywhere". This statement comes as the brand continues to push its "This is an Xbox" marketing campaign to promote gaming across multiple devices.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees, of course, and ex-Blizzard president Mike Ybarra is seemingly quite against the idea. In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1981454023380107544">he simply said</a> "Someone go tell Nintendo that exclusives are antiquated".</p>
<p>When another user challenged this statement, Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1981461659060490395">doubled down</a> and explained that Nintendo has thrived on console exclusivity, deeming the company's strategy of "risk and return" a big success:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo has continually dominated with outstanding games. Sure some platforms flopped, but they always took risk and came back very strong.</p>
<p>"It is the opposite of antiquated. It is risk and return."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Xbox has recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">reiterated its support for the Switch 2</a>, with CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer stating that "if there are people who want to play our games on the PlayStation 5 or the Nintendo Switch 2, we would love for them to play our games on those platforms".</p>
<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved has not been confirmed for the Switch 2 at the time of writing, but we know Nintendo likes to keep these kind of announcements to itself in Direct presentations. That's not to say it <em>will</em> happen, but we honestly wouldn't be surprised at this point.</p>

<p>As spotted by our friends over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-we-are-making-now-is-a-nintendo-game-metroid-prime-producer-kensuke-tanabe-reveals-creative-tensions-with-retro-in-new-book">IGN</a>, the book highlights some of the clashes that occurred between the North American studio and Nintendo itself during the development of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>.</p>
<p>Tanabe explains that while "Nintendo retained the final decision-making authority", there were "many instances early on where our approaches to the specifications did not align, leading to disagreements."</p>
<p>He says that Retro would often push back on key decisions, telling Nintendo that "this is how Western studios approach and think about game development." Tanabe countered this by explaining to Retro that "the game we are making now is a Nintendo game, and this is Retro’s first time working on one. I’ve been working on Nintendo games my whole career, so I believe I have the most experience in making Nintendo games. So please trust me first."</p>
<p>Tanabe reveals that these disagreements would often result in day-long meetings ending in a stalemate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One day, during a video conference about the Meta Ridley battle, our discussions kept clashing, and we couldn’t find common ground. Time slipped away, and by the time the meeting (which had started in the morning) finally ended, the sun was setting. Many Nintendo developers have learned from Mr. Miyamoto that the appearance of enemy characters should be designed based on functionality… this had not yet been articulated quite so concisely. As a result, it took time for us to convey the concept clearly to Retro."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that this was Retro's first game, it's remarkable that its staff felt bold enough to challenge Nintendo – but it would seem that this willingness to dig in is what helped make the three Prime games so memorable.</p>
<p>One example of stubbornness paying off is related to the game's Morph Ball transformation, which shifts the player's perspective to third-person. However, even then, a compromise was still reached.</p>
<p>"The transition animation for shifting from first-person Morph Ball mode was proposed by Retro," says Tanabe. "However, Retro also suggested a skip feature to reduce morphing time, but Mr. Miyamoto directed that it should be unskippable, as it was one of the opportunities to view Samus in third-person. Retro also proposed the mechanic of rolling through half-pipes in Morph Ball mode. Initially, Nintendo was skeptical, questioning whether it would actually be fun. However, Retro responded, ‘Please try it first before deciding.’"</p>
<p>Ultimately, Retro and Nintendo were able to produce a game which is now regarded as one of the best ever made, and Tanabe is keen to acknowledge the contribution of both parties.</p>
<p>"[The Metroid Prime Trilogy] was made possible by Retro maximizing the hardware’s potential through expert engineering, incorporating countless ideas without compromise to refine game design, and setting new standards for graphics in Nintendo titles."</p>

<figure data-uuid="0d9cfe7bdc6d4"><a title="Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d9cfe7bdc6d4/legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're back with another look at the UK boxed charts and, surprising no one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has maintained its lead in the second week, with original Switch sales now starting to outpace Switch 2. Heck, with 150 million+ consoles out in the wild, we expected nothing less.</p>
<p>However, according to Chris Dring over at <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1">The Game Business</a>, sales are roughly 28% lower than that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> across Europe. Going one step further, he states that Legends: Z-A is the smallest retail launch for the 'mainline' franchise since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee!</a> in 2018.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vzkuir&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, one potential explanation for this is that Legends: Z-A was heavily pushed for the Switch 2, which naturally has a much lower install base compared to its predecessor. Switch 2 sales for the game, in general, have been stronger than that of Switch 1 since launch on 16th October.</p>
<p>We've also got a few newcomers this week, but none of them have really made a substantial impact – at least in terms of retail sales. Digital is, of course, another story. We've got <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/jurassic_world_evolution_3">Jurassic World: Evolution 3</a> at number 5, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> at number 12, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> at number 16, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/vampire_the_masquerade_-_bloodlines_2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> at number 20, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tormented_souls_2">Tormented Souls 2</a> at number 27.</p>
<p>Good news for Nintendo, then, as Switch / Switch 2 games make up half of the top ten here, including the aforementioned Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
