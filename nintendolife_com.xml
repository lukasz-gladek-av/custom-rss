<p>Rubato launches this March</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Developer Headcannon, which perhaps most notably developed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a> alongside Christian Whitehead and PagodaWest Games, has announced the release date for its new game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rubato">Rubato</a>. The experimental 2D title will hit the Switch eShop on <strong>20th March 2026</strong>, and there's a free demo you can check out right now.</p>
<p>It's not been smooth sailing for Headcannon, however, as the developer recently released a blog post detailing "a rough few years", stating that all it wants to do is "make some damn games". It cites "corporate bureaucracy" as one of its headaches, along with personal difficulties and the cost of living.</p>
<p>Here's the post in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's been a rough few months.</p>
<p>"Hell.. it's been a rough few years. That's got a lot to do with our new slogan, which you may have noticed at the top of this page. Software Development is a complex process in the first place and doesn't need other forces to come along and make it even more challenging. Corporate bureaucracy certainly doesn't help whether you work from within or without "the industry", you have to be really careful about who you choose to work with and what you prioritize, the cost of living makes it less and less possible for an independent to spend time actually developing anything, I could go on listing issues we face that I'm sure other devs can sympathize with. Let's not even get into all the personal stuff that's befallen each of us lately. I don't want to spend a whole bunch of time complaining about it, but none of us want to pretend It's not extremely frustrating. I've personally always wanted to be as clear and straightforward as possible, and as independents, I'm hoping we can bring more of that to Headcannon. Given that, there seems to be only one thing left to say on the matter - "We just wanna make some damn games."</p>
<p>"We're still doing what we can. More (very) soon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that Headcannon was also open regarding issues surrounding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_origins">Sonic Origins</a>, which it too contributed towards. According to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/sonic-origins-contributor-shares-frustrations-over-the-state-of-the-game">Stealth via social media</a>, the final release contained bugs and glitches that weren't present in the build that Headcannon submitted to Sega. The thread notes that the team "were outsiders creating a separate project that was then wrangled into something entirely different". It's unclear whether these issues are being indirectly referenced in the above statement.</p>
<p>Rubato, meanwhile, is described as a Metroidvania of sorts, but judging from the trailer above, it's also loaded with awesome minigames and a sense of humour that we suspect might resonate quite well with us.</p>
<p>The game will also launch on Steam and PS5, though an Xbox release is currently TBA thanks to some complications with the Microsoft Partner Program backend.</p>

<figure data-uuid="b09d1b7326bff"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b09d1b7326bff/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After being announced for Switch 2 way back in the console's reveal Direct, we are now just days away from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>.</p>
<p>We're so close, in fact, that the reviews have started rolling in, and it's a pretty positive picture. Here at Nintendo Life, we had a wonderful time with FFVII, calling it "one of the best Switch 2 ports so far" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a brief snippet, followed by the whole thing, so you can read Alana's thoughts in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are caveats like 30fps, softer screen resolution, and some fuzzy textures. But Square Enix has clearly put the time and effort in here to ensure the best possible result, and with the Episode INTERMission DLC included as standard too, this might be the definitive way to play Remake on the go</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>But we're not the only ones with thoughts on the latest Square Enix joint! Below, we have rounded up a handful of reviews from across the internet to try and give you a better idea of the full range of opinions on display. Spoilers, we were not alone in our admiration.</p>
<p>Right at the top of the pile is <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2/">CGMagazine</a>, where the outlet scored FFVII a 9.5/10 on Switch 2, praising how the title showcases the console's technical chops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’ve been holding off from playing <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> all this time because you don’t have a PS5 or gaming PC, the Switch 2 port is practically a must-play</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://rpgamer.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">RPGamer</a> came in with a 4.5/5 review, arguing that the title "fits wonderfully onto the Switch 2":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a huge amount to enjoy about the game, be it the exciting combat, impressive presentation, highly endearing cast, fascinating adjustments to the original tale, or detailed realisation of Midgar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Staying in the same camp, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/review/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">Comicbook.com</a> gave the game a 4.5/5, particularly calling out the "absolute bargain" price as a major pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em> remains $39.99 on the Switch 2 as it has been for PS5 and PC. And for the hours of solid action RPG combat it offers, that’s an absolute bargain in today’s market</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">Vooks</a> kept the good times going in its 4.5/5 review, praising the progression streamlining and Switch 2's HDR prowess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Fantasy Remake 7 Intergrade is one of the best-looking games on the Switch 2 to date, with an incredible port that compromises on very little to deliver a fantastic version of an already stunning game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, things dropped <em>ever so slightly</em> for <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Nintendo Insider</a>'s 8/10 review, which shared many of the positives outlined above, but still felt that the major story beats are a little lacking in this first part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can strongly recommend it, albeit with the caveat that you aren’t going to get any meaningful plot resolution within this part of the overall story. If you’re okay with that, then all I can say is… let’s mosey</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All seems very consistent (and rather unsurprising), right? At the time of writing, the Switch 2 version is sitting with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score of 90 based on 24 reviews. We're sure more takes will roll in over the coming days, but for now, it seems, good game is still good.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade arrives on Switch 2 tomorrow, 22nd January 2025.</p>
