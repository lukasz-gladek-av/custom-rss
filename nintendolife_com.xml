<figure><a title="OFF" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/108bafb36749a/off.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Fangamer</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, it's the weekend once again, which means it's time to get some gaming done!</p>
<p>But first, a recap. This week, Capcom launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/capcom-launches-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-website">an intriguing 30th anniversary website for Resident Evil</a>, though there's not much on there right now beyond some cool artwork. Gamescom also happened, which means we got some really cool announcements including a port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> in 2026, and brand-new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/atari-announces-bubsy-4d-from-demon-turf-developer-fabraz">Bubsy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/he-man-is-the-next-80s-icon-getting-his-own-stunning-arcade-style-retro-revival">He-Man</a> games! What!</p>
<p>Nintendo also showcased a new Direct looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which officially launches on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. We even got to go hands-on with the game at Gamescom, and it's looking really nice, y'all.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">release date</a>. No big deal.</p>
<p>Now, let's see what we're all up this weekend, hmm..?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186593,186826 @ 1755947437 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment. I ended up buying the Year 3 Character Pass, so I'm currently getting to grips with Sagat (ooh, matron) and I can't wait for the other characters to launch.</p>
<p>I'm also quite keen to jump back into the GameCube app and play a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, but we'll see how much free time I manage to carve out.</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>It's no good, I just can't stop playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on my Nintendo Switch 2. Every time I think I've done the vast majority of quests, I'm made aware by an off-hand comment vaguely referencing a mission I have absolutely zero memory of, so I'm compelled to do my duty (I know) and tick an item off my list that I didn't even know was there.</p>
<p>This time around it's a little quest called 'Don't Fear the Reaper'. Anyone familiar with this should know that this could take me some time...</p>

<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/off">OFF</a> may not be a long game by any means, but having just rolled credits on it the other day means my slate is pretty clean now! Of course, I’m slowly chipping away at the battle pass in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> as I <em>HAVE</em> to have those Green and White Ranger skins! Whenever a game lets me play as Tommy, you know I’m in.</p>
<p>I’m also playing though <strong>REDACTED</strong> and am having a pretty swell time with it! I’d say more…but…embargoes, amirite? I’ll spew about it soon, promise.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Ever one to have my finger on the pulse of what’s hip and trendy, I have started playing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> on my PS5 after getting dewy-eyed reminiscing about my time with it on PS2. It’s still a damn good game, I’ve got to give it that, and I’d love to get it wrapped up this weekend so I’m all clear for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> takeoff in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Let’s stay with the contemporary theme and throw in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, too. I never played this one back in the day, so it’ll be nice to see what it’s all about!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After dabbling around with Chibi-Robo for some screenshots this week, I think I'm actually going to play the whole darned thing, something I've never done before. It's weird and delightful and actually a little bit uncomfortable, which I love so far. So I'm excited to dive in further.</p>
<p>That's really all I have planned. Very uneventful, right? Have a good one, all!</p>

<p><em>Well, that's what we have planned for the weekend, but what about you? Let us know your weekend picks in the following poll.</em></p>

<p>Get ready for the third entry</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During Nintendo's recent Partner Direct, Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't got around to playing the second game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_stories_2_wings_of_ruin">Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</a> just yet, now is the chance if you happen to be based in Europe and have an active Switch Online subscription. This same trial is also live in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Mount up for adventure with the Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin Game Trial – now on! @monsterhunter #NintendoSwitchOnline members can download and play the full game for free."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, this will give you access to the full game for free from now until <strong>28th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the third game, which is arriving on Switch 2 next year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/capcoms-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-for-switch-2">in our previous story</a>. And if you want to know more about the second entry, here's a sample from our review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's full of charm and boasts depth that can immerse the committed or be dabbled with by those eager to simply experience the story. As a blend of Monster Hunter with a traditional RPG approach it's an accomplished effort, and offers the sort of meaty experience that'll keep most players busy for weeks."</p>

<p>DK Bananza takes out "best gameplay" award</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f504521d3a83/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you missed it, Gamescom gives out awards every year, and while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/gamescoms-best-nintendo-game-award-scrapped-because-of-too-few-games">Nintendo didn't even feature last year</a>, it's back in 2025 with a few wins. These awards call on a "panel of expert gaming jurors" and the community to decide the winners.</p>
<p>The recent Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has taken out "best gameplay" of the show, placing it ahead of other titles like <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Although Mario Kart World missed out on the gameplay award, it did win "best Nintendo Switch 2 game" of the event, beating not only Donkey Kong Bananza but also upcoming releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4xtlwpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Apart from this, Pokémon was the winner of the "best booth", Capcom won the award for the "best lineup", and the anticipated indie title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> won the best trailer.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award">see the rest of the award winners</a> along with the assessment procedure and criteria on the Gamescom website. To be eligible for an award at Gamescom, a game needs to be present at the event, and developers need to "submit their games for the different categories of the Gamescom award" (there are submission fees, too).</p>
<p>These are some of the first awards for Nintendo's Switch 2 exclusives, and we're still waiting to get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and Metroid Prime 4.</p>

<p>It's almost here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After a long wait and even some delays, we're now just weeks out from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<p>The 'hands on' previews have been rolling in from Gamescom this week, so we're rounding up a handful here including our own. This is the final demo before the game goes on sale to the public on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's a summary of our own thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think you'll all love it, if you do like Hollow Knight - they've absolutely smashed it here... it runs beautifully...the atmosphere, the graphics, it all just plays totally perfect together"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186836 @ 1755944588 -->
<p>So, what did other outlets have to say? Here's the rundown:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview-gamescom-2025/">GamesRadar+:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is building smartly on exceptionally solid foundations, and it's doing so with a greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight-silksong/preview">PCGamesN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong feels exactly like we hoped it would. Beautiful yet brutal. Charming yet challenging. It doesn't seem like a massive departure from the original, but with a few tweaked and rebalanced techniques, it still freshens up the formula."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better">Eurogamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is the game of the moment. And Team Cherry has opted to make this more difficult and a bit more awkward. For platforming fans like me, that's catnip - but will the average player curious in the franchise be so intrigued?"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">Insider Gaming:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay loop is back. The slick dashes, jumps, and swipes are a key part of Hornet’s arsenal. Tactical jabs and prods, using Hornet’s agility and nimble frame to evade attacks; these are hallmarks of what made the original so special and accessible."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-preview-gamescom/">The Gamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I saw nothing to suggest it is reinventing the wheel, although I don’t doubt there will be more than a few abilities to differentiate things. In my humble opinion, this isn’t a bad thing. Hollow Knight is such a unique Metroidvania, that another story in that world is fine by me. After the eternal wait, we’re agonisingly close to playing Team Cherry’s next adventure, and it already feels like it was worth the wait."</p>
</blockquote>
