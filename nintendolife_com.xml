<p><a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/airlite-fit-wired-gaming-headset-nintendo-switch-2?Color=Charcoal+Black&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqqGxjQC5pKcsfuS3eUsng3rzE_7ozq7uRb9y29Bpz3gg-nIrPnPX4">Turtle Beach's Airlite Fir for Switch 2</a> is a little less expensive than the wireless Atlas Air headset that we've got placed on our best-of-list, though, to the tune of over £100, in fact. Yes, this brand new wired headset comes in at a very reasonable £19.99/€24.99, making it a hugely affordable bit of kit.</p>
<p>As an updated version of the company's Airlite Fit for Switch 1, a headset that was very well-received when it launched earlier this year, this <em>should</em> be a very decent choice for anyone looking for something that isn't gonna cost them a fortune, or as a solid choice for kids that you don't mind seeing get a little bashed about.</p>
<p>In terms of updates over the Switch 1 version, well, there doesn't seem to be any internal changes, the differences seem to be of a cosmetic nature only, with some new detailing and an all-new choice of colour for Switch 2 fans.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Working with our partners at Nintendo, we are excited to release our latest Airlite Fit headset for a lightweight and comfortable gaming experience, licensed for Nintendo Switch 2...With proven, excellent audio performance at an affordable price, the Airlite Fit enhances the amazing experiences on Nintendo Switch 2 for gamers everywhere.”</p>

The versatile 3.5mm audio connection is fully compatible across all Nintendo Switch systems.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
