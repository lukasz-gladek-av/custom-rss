<p>And it's out now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you thought the day's surprises were over, think again, as Bethesda, id Software, and retro specialists Nightdive Studios have announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, the "definitive re-release" of two classic spell shooters. Oh, and it's also out <em>right now</em> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/heretic-hexen-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>For just $14.99 (it's not up on the EU eShop at the time of writing this), you'll be able to pick up two of Raven Software's iconic first-person shooters which introduced inventory systems, vertical aiming, and character classes to the genre.</p>
<p>Heretic originally launched in 1994 on PC and was made in the DOOM engine; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hexen">Hexen</a> is a direct sequel that followed in 1995 and got a Nintendo 64 release in North America in 1997.</p>
<p>This release bundles together all of the games' content — <strong>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders</strong>, <strong>Hexen: Beyond Heretic</strong>, and <strong>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</strong> — plus two new episodes created by Nightdive and id Software: <strong>Heretic: Faith Renewed</strong> and <strong>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</strong>.</p>
<p>But, given that it's Nightdive at the helm, you probably want to see all the shiny new enhancements, right? Here they are (from the eShop page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong><br>
• Online cross-platform and local split-screen deathmatch and co-op modes<br>
• Toggleable enhanced soundtrack from Andrew Hulshult<br>
• In-game mod support (Nintendo Switch™ only supports featured mods, curated by the team at id.)<br>
• An array of accessibility options, quality-of-life improvements, and engine fixes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nightdive Studios just continue to keep impressing — we've only <em>just</em> got our mitts on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, so it looks like we'll be dipping into Nightdive's seemingly endless pool of retro rereleases once again.</p>
<p><em>Have you played either Heretic or Hexen before? Will you be grabbing this on Switch? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>Hardware this week yields no change in the top ten, with the Switch 2 once again claiming the top spot. Cumulative Switch sales reach 18,637 units this week, while the PS5 has managed a total of 7,141. So yes, despite Nintendo launching a <em>brand new console</em>, mind you, the previous-gen Switch managed to outsell the PS5 by more than 2:1.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-apex-legends-switch-2-a-giant-leap-over-the-tragic-switch-1-version.1264971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. I feel like I have to remind myself of that sometimes, as I'm so bored off my face with shooters in general, and don't really play online competitively anymore. I just can't be bothered with the stress and/or real emotion of it all.</p>
<p>However, Apex Legends, once I get over myself and turn it on, does stuff that pleases my monkey brain quite a lot. Back in 2019 when it released, which feels like centuries ago now, I couldn't believe how clever, simple, and obvious this hero shooter's ping system was. How hadn't anyone done this before? It's a game that's built with no-fuss, unobtrusive teamwork at its core. And it makes it a blast for anyone to have fun with.</p><!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/accessibility-report/2700/embed @ 1754597391 -->
<p>The roster of hero characters, which is now enormous compared to when I last played it, is hugely varied, and they all have amplified and incredibly moreish methods of traversal. It's all very zippy, cloaky, boost-jumpy, and very, very fast. The movement and controls and shooting and zooming around collecting stuff endlessly is just as pleasing as the pings. I know you know all of this already, I'm just saying.</p>
<p>Back on Switch 1, Apex Legends managed to arrive feature-complete. However, it was laid low by terrible performance issues. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/apex_legends">I gave it a 5/10</a>, saying it was still fun to play, but had notable frame rate issues, muddy textures, unresponsive and laggy controls...yeah, it was basically a really tragic Switch port.</p>
<p>We don't have to worry about any of this now, though. We can concentrate on having a good time with what's surely still one of the very best (if not <em>the</em> best) hero shooter, Battle Royale...eh, thingies out there. It really is that good. I've used my unlock tokens to grab all but three of the full roster, and I've fallen down the rabbit hole once more.</p>
<p>Because, much like how its ping system originally dazzled me, this Switch 2 port has dazzled me all over again by being perhaps the very first fully-fledged and functionally perfect online shooter that I've ever sat and played on my sofa on a portable console. Yes, there are other great online shooter games on Switch, like the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> series, but this scratches a very different shooter itch. And it's free!</p>
<p>In docked and handheld, performance feels great on Switch 2, and bar the odd hiccup as you load into a stage, this is silky smooth stuff, even during busy firefights. It looks perfectly crisp and clear at <em>all times</em>. Add in motion controls for fine-tuning your snipes, a bonus mouse-mode that's fun (I'm still using the normal controls, mind), and you've got a version of Apex Legends that, despite all of its hard-selling of Apex Points and outfits, is very, very hard to pick a hole in.</p>
<p>In fact, Apex Legends redeems itself on Switch 2. This upgraded version gives us 60fps shooting action with crisp, clear resolutions and none of that juddery, unresponsive, blurry stuff we had back in 2021. It's still the best hero shooter/Battle Royale out there for me, with amazingly fluid traversal, best-in-class gunfeel, and a ping system that puts proper teamwork and tactics front and centre. The cherry on top, of course, is that it's free to play, too, so there's no good reason for shooter fans not to dive right in.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends]]></content:encoded>
