<p>Needs a little more time in the cauldron</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It feels like we have been waiting for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a> for ages, and today, Chucklefish has announced that we'll be staying this way for a while longer, as the game has been delayed until <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Shared in a development update on the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">Witchbrook website</a>, the studio thanked fans for their continued "patience, passion and continued support" as it announced that it was taking the extra time to make sure the world of Mossport felt <em>just right</em>, while also getting the chance to add "exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support".</p>
<p>Here's a snippet of the dev announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/devblog-simulation/"><em>first blog</em></a>, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always a shame to hear of a game delay, though given that the release window was originally billed for 'Winter 2025', it's hardly the end of the world. In a note on the game's <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/#FAQ">FAQ page</a>, Chucklefish states that it is "proud to be a zero-crunch studio," reaffirming that "we truly believe that developers who are healthy and well-rested make better games". Honestly, it's hard to disagree with that.</p>
<p>It's not all bad news, mind you, as the update also saw the reveal of the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">Mossport interactive map</a>, which showcases just how big this magical world is — spoiler: it's pretty big.</p>
<p>We're still lacking the specifics on that 2026 date at the moment, but the game's delightful pixel art, witch-y aesthetics and all-around cosiness leave us happy to wait for as long as it needs.</p>
