<figure><a title="Weaponlord - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/889e99b0841d6/weaponlord-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Brawl</a>, my friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-weaponlord-snes">Last week</a>, North America and Europe duked it out over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/weaponlord">Weaponlord</a> on the Super NES, with NA giving their EU PALs a good wholloping and taking home 85% of the vote.</p>
<p>Today, we're looking back at Rare's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/blast_corps">Blast Corps</a>, a delightful piece of nonsense from Twycross' 64-bit masters which saw you destroying everything in the path of a trundling warhead to prevent a catastrophic explosion. What can we say? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>'s got us in the mood for smashing stuff to smithereens.</p>
<p>It's a duel this week, as the European version was just the NA version with the customary black border. After checking out the options, drop your vote in the poll at the bottom of the page and we'll see whether East or West is best when it comes to the ol' smashy-smashy.</p>
<p>Let's get blasting.</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Blast Corps - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/053855f056548/blast-corps-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Microsoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Western variant. shows J-Bomb standing atop Backlash with the bike (Ballista) in the bottom right corner, behind which the big red bomb-laden carrier is seen approaching.</p>
<p>The puddle at the bottom, the flying bricks, and the fiery billows from the collapsing building offer some visual interest and help distract from the blocky nature of the render. The logo in the top right feels a bit generic and the red stencilled 'BLAST' gets a bit lost on top of the radiation symbol, but despite being a bit disparate, we can't help up like this.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Blastdozer - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25f46a6a47771/blastdozer-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Microsoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether you prefer the Japanese or North American cover, we can all agree that <strong>Blastdozer</strong> is just a better name, if only because there's zero confusion over the pronunciation and you're unlikely to provoke laughs in the playground when you tell your pals that Blast 'Corpse' looks amazing, instigating months of merciless ribbing.</p>
<p>Ahem. Looking at the cover, there's a lot to love. Cool mechs and big vehicles? Check. Explosions? Natch. Big red slogan slapped right over the centre? Boom. In honesty, 'BLAST 'EM ALL!' isn't the most riveting line, but we admire the bombast of putting it right in the centre of the blast, exactly where a less confident game would slap the logo.</p>
<p>And that logo at the bottom is a winner, too, boldly mixing the blue-tinged steel plating with the yellow and black warning barrier behind. We're not quite sure that that red, ticker-tape thing around the border is supposed to be, but we think we like it.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Remember that this one is part of the Switch Online Expansion Pack library, so if you missed it back in *checks notes*...1997...*has a moment*, you can easily catch up with this winner.</em></p>
<p><em>Otherwise, we'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p>

<p>It got a surprise release this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The latest Pokémon Presents broadcast earlier this week included the surprise release of a new puzzle game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a>.</p>
<p>It's available now as a free download on mobile devices and a one-time payment from the Switch eShop. Along with this are additional transactions, including DLC packs, which add more content and gameplay to your experience.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:185512 @ 1753609812 -->
<p>There's been a bit of a mixed response to not only the game, but also the DLC options, and it's got us wondering if the community here on Nintendo Life will be giving this title a chance. We're also curious to know if you've purchased any of the additional content yet.</p>
<p>So, vote in our poll and leave a comment below.<em><br></em></p>


<p>If you're curious to know more about this title, here's a bit more information from the official Nintendo website. We've also got a Switch review on the way, and will be delievering our final verdict on the title soon.</p>
<blockquote>

Solve sets of three random puzzles to help untangle your mind—then place the yarn you obtain into the Plush-O-Matic: a special machine that creates in-game Pokémon plush! As you try to make them all, you can track your crafted plush in the catalog. You can also mark your calendar with a stamp each day you play, and then go back and practice the puzzles you played on those days.</p>
<p>Complete friend quests and get furniture to decorate your plush rooms</p>
<p>Folks around town will ask you to bring them specific plush. Finish these friend quests to give each plush a forever home and increase your friendship level with the townspeople. Grateful townspeople will give rewards, including furniture, which you can use to decorate your in-game plush rooms—along with all the plush you like too much to give away!</p>

<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7f9feee95eb2/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since Nintendo introduced motion control with its Wii console, we've had to contend with bolt-on plastic accessories getting in the way of perfectly good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_kart_wii">Mario Kart</a> multiplayer sessions.</p>
<p>The iconic Wii Wheel, while a novelty, was widely regarded by seasoned players as the worst way to control the game – and while I fear I may be upsetting some people with this statement, the same was generally true of the original Switch Joy-Con wheel, which launched alongside the console and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> back in 2017.</p>
<p>As predictably as night follows day, Nintendo has released an updated set of wheels for Switch 2, and if you're expecting me to suddenly completely revise my opinion of these largely superfluous chunks of plastic, you might be sorely disappointed. Does that mean they're not worth a look? Well, the answer to that is somewhat more complex.</p>

<p>Before we dive into that, though, let's talk a little about what's new and different with this pair of wheels. As you can imagine, the design has changed in order to accommodate the larger Joy-Con 2, and I have to admit I do like the way these look. The coloured band which runs around each wheel offers welcome grip, and Nintendo has done a good job of making the wheel look as neat and tidy as possible – you won't spy any screws, for example.</p>
<p>I'm also pretty pleased with how the Joy-Con 2 clicks into place using magnets; once slotted into the wheel, the controller automatically tries to pair with your console thanks to this magnet connection – just like when you bolt it onto your Switch 2. On the back of the wheel are two good-sized buttons which correspond to the shoulder triggers on top of the controllers; the Joy-Con 2's other inputs are all open to the elements and can be accessed normally.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c028917824f6e/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The appeal of this accessory — and those which came before it — lies in the fact that you can 'turn' it like a real steering wheel, delivering a sense of immersion which is not entirely unwelcome during intense <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> sessions.</p>
<p>The obvious shortcoming is that, with the wheel 'floating' in mid-air and not attached to a steering column, it's a frustratingly imprecise control method. There's a tendency to 'twist' the wheel during turns, and it's hard to gauge what the limits of your turn actually are, making tight changes of direction more difficult than they are when using the analogue stick. With prolonged play, you can coach yourself into holding the wheel in the right way, but it's never as accurate as using a Joy-Con or Pro Controller.</p>
<p>All of which means the wheel won't find any favour with serious Mario Karters – but then, that's not the sector of the market this product is aimed at.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f5158b56ff6ba/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, these wheels are intended to be used by more casual (and perhaps younger) players who are concerned with having as good a time as possible and not setting the best possible lap times. Sure, playing with a mix of wheels and Joy-Cons is only going to result in the wheel-based players losing out, but if you're <em>all</em> using a wheel and therefore on a level playing field, things become a lot more enjoyable.</p>
<p>The best thing is that these accessories are <em>fairly</em> cheap; a pair costs £16.99 / $25, so you can indulge in a four-player session for relatively little cash.</p>
<p>It's business as usual, then; the Joy-Con 2 wheel isn't going to change your mind on motion controls, but it can be the source of much entertainment and hilarity regardless – if you approach it with the right frame of mind, of course.</p>

<figure><a title="SpongeBob SquarePants" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcf2cf994a6b2/spongebob-squarepants.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch was treated to multiple SpongeBob games during its prime, and it looks like a new game in the popular Nickelodeon series could now be on its way to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's been discovered the title '<strong>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide'</strong> was rated in <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1930695174461554999">South Korea and Germany recently</a>. Adding to this, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/bob-leponge-est-de-retour-un-nouveau-jeu-video-prevu-pour-cet-automne-60284">Dealabs and Billbil-Kun report</a> it's coming to multiple current-generation platforms including the Switch 2, and it's expected to surface this November.</p>
<p>This new game will apparently retail for $39.99 USD (<em>or the regional equivalent</em>) and a physical version is also believed to be on the way to the Switch 2. Right now, there's "no trace" of a Switch version.</p>
<p>This next title would follow SpongeBob games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">The Cosmic Shake</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_battle_for_bikini_bottom_-_rehydrated">Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated</a>. Notably, THQ Nordic is hosting a <a href="https://showcase.thqnordic.com/">digital showcase</a> at the beginning of next month, which follows a <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcXWK2jJZc">teaser of a new SpongeBob game last October</a>.</p>
<p>This latest SpongeBob development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumoured-plants-vs-zombies-remaster-potentially-releasing-on-switch-this-year">same source sharing an update</a> about the rumoured <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">Plants vs. Zombies</a> remaster.</p>
<p>Sega also recently revealed SpongeBob would be appearing in the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> game later this year. And earlier this week, Nickelodeon's new multiplayer game (featuring SpongeBob) locked in a release date for Switch.</p>
