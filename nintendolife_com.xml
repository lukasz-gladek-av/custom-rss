<p>"AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas"</p>

<figure data-uuid="95589e4db57d8"><a title="Sega Will &quot;Carefully Assess Appropriate Use Cases&quot; When It Comes To AI 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95589e4db57d8/sega-will-carefully-assess-appropriate-use-cases-when-it-comes-to-ai-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/IDWPublishing">Sega / IDW</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>While rivals such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ubisoft-is-all-in-on-generative-ai-says-its-as-big-a-leap-in-tech-as-the-shift-to-3d">Ubisoft</a> have jumped into the world of Generative AI development with both feet, not every company in the games industry is willing to throw caution to the wind.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session following its recent Q2 financial results, Sega‘s top brass addressed the use of AI when it comes to making games (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-says-it-will-use-ai-in-game-development-but-only-in-appropriate-use-cases/">VGC</a>) and how it will help tackle the increasing costs of development.</p>
<p>Sega's response was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI. However, as AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas such as character creation, we will proceed by carefully assess appropriate use cases, such as streamlining development processes."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while Sega certainly isn't against turning to AI to streamline production, it doesn't look like it will be embracing it with quite the same vigour as other companies.</p>
<p>While Generative AI models are powerful tools, they are often trained on the work of artists, musicians, filmmakers<span>, and animators without permission or remuneration. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">Many models have been found to produce</a></span> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">copyright-infringing results with minimal effort.</a></p>
<p>Nintendo has previously stated that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">doesn't currently intend</a> to use Generative AI in its own games, citing "issues with intellectual property rights" as one of the main reasons for avoiding it.</p>

<p>Is that a psychic crystal embedded in your forehead, or are you just happy to see me?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7c30e4405c23d"><a title="samus Aran Varia Suit Chogokin" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c30e4405c23d/samus-aran-varia-suit-chogokin.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Spirits</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally in the wild (still feels weird to be able to type that) and given that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another excellent entry</a> in this phenomenal series, you may well be feeling like now's the time for some fancy Metroid merch.</p>
<p>Well, say no more because (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/12/03/samus-aran-finally-gets-the-chogokin-toy-she-deserves-next-year/">Forbes</a> for the heads-up) Bandai Spirits has announced a very appealing diecast 'Samus Aran in Varia Suit' model that's got us morphing in and out of ball mode furiously over here. Whatever that means.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, it is very nice. We agree. Standing at 21cm, there's a whole lot of lovely diecast metal here, and with lights accentuating all of the most important and iconic elements, such as Samus' great big cannon (so batteries required). We've also got lots of nice moveable joints, so you can recreate all your most frequent in-game poses (for this writer that's just Samus' death pose).</p>


<p>We've been over <a href="https://tamashiiweb.com/item/15649/?wovn=en">on the official website</a>, and the price is set at 30,800 yen (that's around £148 or $198) and you can also pre-order on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_A3AA2">official Nintendo site</a>. However! Fly in the ointment klaxon. The pre-orders, which went live yesterday AM, are Japan-only for now. Although we can't see it being very long before you're able to get yourself one imported from either the main Bandai Spirits website or another vendor.</p>
<p>The expected release date for the model is May 2026. Ooooft. It would have looked so good on top of the Christmas tree, too. Maybe next year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cejqzkpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
