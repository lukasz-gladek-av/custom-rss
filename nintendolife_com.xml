<p>A survey for the game is also live</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In July, Bandai Namco released its new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a> themed title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shadow_labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a> across multiple platforms. Now, in an update today, the development team has rolled out a new patch for this game.</p>
<p>It addresses multiple issues and makes some other adjustments. This will also bump the game up to Version 1.0.4, and it is now available on all platforms, including Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes from Bandai Namco's game page:</p>
<h3>Shadow Labyrinth - Patch 1.0.4</h3>

<li>Fixed an issue where players could become buried in a wall when caught on special terrain with ACTIV shots during the "Lord of Gluttony" battle.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would crash after a certain period of time if the time ran out while the player was stopped at the edge of the screen during the Withered Volcano MAZE boss battle.<br>
Other minor display fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adjustments</h3>

<li>Increased the initial number of lives in MAZEs in general.</li>
<li>Relaxed the clear time for the MAZEs of G-Hosts: Red Bragza: Terrias-Gilba, Blue Bragza: Terrias-Juno, Pink Bragza: Terrias-Boz Rag, and Orange Bragza: Terrias-Valou.</li>
<li>Changed the operation settings in mini-pack mode and whether or not to display the jump guide to be saved.</li>
<li>Adjusted the behavior of some bosses.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The team is also looking at other ways to improve the overall gameplay experience and says it will be paying "close attention to opinions and requests from players".
