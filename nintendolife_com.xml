<p>Now that's Friendship</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After months of leaks, teases, and unexpected inclusions, Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> finally has a release date for both digital and physical versions.</p>
<p>Digitally, the game will launch on the Switch eShop — both Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions - on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>. A physical release follows on <strong>12th December</strong> and, don't forget, the Switch 2 Edition will be fully on the cartridge.</p>
<p>Physical pre-orders are already live <a href="https://atari.com/collections/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection?srsltid=AfmBOorB3CMFaCmt2V-Cea21SYKweOIyoV7zM0JfqX0lt2VmvON0Oc5i">on Atari's website</a>, but digital pre-orders are going up on 15th September.</p>
<p>For those hankering for a digital history lesson of one of the fighting game genre's most-important franchises, this is the Kollection for you. With online play, rollback netcode, and tons of documentary footage, the history of Mortal Kombat will be immortalised with the loving care we're used to from Digital Eclipse.</p>
<p>Here's a complete list of all the games included in the collection:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mortal_kombat">Mortal Kombat</a></li>

<figure><a title="Mario Lead" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a3e50e01ab33/mario-lead.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As expected, Nintendo spent a good chunk of its latest Direct presentation focusing on the 40th anniversary of <strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong> with a host of announcements both big and small.</p>
<p>The platforming icon celebrates his big four-zero on 13th September 2025 and, while we didn't get the brand-new 3D Mario that we were perhaps expecting, we're quite pleased with the reveals regardless.</p>
<p>So we thought we'd compile everything in one place for your perusal. Be sure to let us know with a comment which announcement was your favourite.</p>

<p>Mii like the look of this</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During today's Direct, Nintendo shared a trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> which, well, it's got some fairly disturbing voices in it, amongst other things.</p>
<p>While we don't have a release date yet, Nintendo did confirm that the sequel to the 3DS's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> is coming to the Switch 1 in <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, narrowing that window down a little bit.</p>
<p>As you can see from the trailer above, this one's is all about living your dream life on a little island full of terrifying Mii-styled characters. There's plenty of customisation here in terms of both your character and their styles, and the island itself looks very similar to the sort of colourful island we all know and love from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>Players oversee control of the island setting out, and can then create a whole bunch of Miis to act as their residents. Once happy with their appearance, you then get to choose personality traits - which could be very amusing if it's got some flexibility to it - and the modulated voices are always funny, let's face it. Weird, but amusing.</p>

<p>With minigames on display in the snippet of action you can see up top, and a definite dark streak in the humour on display, we'd say Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream is one to keep an eye on for 2026.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to hit you up with the exact release date as soon as we've got it.</p>

<p>No twist of fate</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the big hour-long Nintendo Direct, Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> got a release date for Switch 2! And it's landing on the console on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The game was revealed back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/capcoms-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-for-switch-2">July's Partner Showcase</a> and has received a huge glow-up from its lovely-looking predecessors. But this is more of that charming turn-based Monster Hunter action we've seen on 3DS and Switch.</p>
<p>In the brand new trailer, there's a revelation: twin monsters are "a portent of disaster" and we've got twin Rathalos(es?) on our hands. One of them is yours and you'll be riding them around the world as you tame Monsties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While new details are sparse, we do have a rundown of the game from its Steam page, so check that out if you need a refresher:</p>
<p>Embark on a new adventure in the third installment of the turn-based RPG series set in the world of Monster Hunter! Become a Rider in the Monster Hunter Stories series as you hatch and build kinship with friendly monsters known as Monsties, then explore and battle alongside them in a world full of potential!</p>
<p>Set two centuries after a conflict that divided neighboring kingdoms, the drums of war are reignited as twin Rathalos—long thought extinct—hatch from a single egg: an omen of destruction.</p>
<p>Two kingdoms, two Riders, and two Rathalos; their fates now intertwined. As calamity encroaches, seek hope beyond the border and into forbidden lands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 is coming to Switch 2 in March 2026 — ready to ride Rathalos into the skies? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Another free upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the gift that just keeps on giving — just a few weeks after ConcernedApe announced it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">working on a 1.7 update</a>, today's Nintendo Direct also unveiled a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of the beloved farming sim.</p>
<p>And of course, the upgrade is 100% free too. Plus, it includes Mouse Mode controls, which will make decorating your house and farm <em>so</em> much easier.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition isn't just about the mouse, though. Four-player split-screen multiplayer and eight-player online multiplayer is also coming.</p>
<p><em>And</em> just in case you still didn't think Stardew was great value, you can now use GameShare to play with up to up to three others if they don't have the game. And yes, it works with Switch 1 and Switch 2. That's pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley is already one of the best games on Switch, and it's easily one of the best farm sims of all time. We can't wait to lose our life to this again on Switch 2. It might be time for a new co-op farm...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>it's not even out yet, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is <em>already</em> getting DLC, and it was announced during today's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension</a> doesn't have a release date yet, but it looks to focus on the Pokémon Hoopa and features two brand new Mega Evolutions for Raichu — Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y.</p>
<p>Hoopa is apparently opening up dimensions across Lumiose City. What that means for our intrepid trainer? No idea, but we bet we'll get hoop-ing (sorry) in to find out.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the only Z-A news we got today. Just before that, we got <a href="https://youtu.be/PPTqA10lt-c?si=Wl_17ewBg7a7QQF0">a little peek at three new Mega Evolutions</a>, and they're for the Kalos Starter Trio.</p>
<p>Yep, Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja are all getting their own Mega. <em>Finally</em><em>.</em> You'll need to earn a Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite via the Z-A Battle Club in order to see them, but they're excellent evolutions of their original class-based designs.</p>
<p>However, the kicker is that they're only available via <em>online</em> Ranked Battles. According to the press release, "Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite stones cannot normally be obtained during regular gameplay. Mega Stones obtainable as promotion rewards are planned to be redistributed in future seasons." So that's a bit of a bummer.</p>

<p>We've already seen a brand new Mega Evolution in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pokemon-legends-z-a-unveils-a-newly-discovered-mega-evolution">Mega Malamar earlier this week</a>, so with this batch of five newbies, we're swimming in new battle opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of these new Megas in the comments below!</em></p>
