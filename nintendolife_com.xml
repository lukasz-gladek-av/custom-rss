<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> hits the Switch 2 next month and if you weren't already excited about the game, to top it off, there are a bunch of retro Sega titles you'll be able to revisit.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/sega-is-adding-playable-bandai-namco-game-gear-titles-to-yakuza-kiwami-3">recent Game Gear news</a>, another arcade title has been revealed. As noted by our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/woah-yet-another-sega-arcade-oddity-confirmed-for-yakuza-kiwami-3-on-ps5-ps4">pals at PushSquare</a>, it's the "delightfully oddball" Model 3 release, <strong><a href="https://segaretro.org/Magical_Truck_Adventure">Magical Truck Adventure</a>.</strong> It will be joined by <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sega-classic-emergency-call-ambulance-comes-to-ps5-ps4-via-yakuza-3-remake">Emergency Call Ambulance</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/arcade-beat-em-up-slashout-joins-emergency-call-ambulance-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-on-ps5-ps4">SlashOut</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This title originally debuted in 1998 and is a solo and co-op "on-the-rails" action experience where you control two kids named Roy and Alma who must power a hand-operated rail cart to retrieve a "magical stone". You'll also be required to dodge and jump things along the way, as you pump the lever up and down to accelerate through a variety of wild and wacky courses.</p>

<p>You can see the other retro games revealed for Yakuza 3 Kiwami so far <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/sega-is-adding-playable-bandai-namco-game-gear-titles-to-yakuza-kiwami-3">in our story from earlier this week</a>. We've also gone hands on with the game, and an announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/15/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-hands-on-report/">PlayStation Blog</a> recently confirmed this upcoming release would be getting a demo.</p>

<p>Ignited by a viral Metacritic campaign</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c0e42cf26f5db"><a title="Cory in the House" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c0e42cf26f5db/cory-in-the-house.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Disney</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this week, the 2008 Nintendo DS title Disney title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/disneys_cory_in_the_house">Cory in the House</a> was reportedly on the cusp of dethroning the award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a> on Metacritic's user ranking list.</p>
<p>Although Clair Obscur <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/all-time/userscore/?releaseYearMin=1958&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=1">remains out in front at the time of writing</a> with a user score of 9.6, as a result of this viral campaign to get Cory's game into the top spot, it's now reportedly led to the title's price spiking in value on eBay. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awful-nintendo-ds-game-disney-cory-in-the-house-now-selling-for-hundreds-of-dollars-on-ebay-amid-viral-metacritic-campaign">highlighted by IGN</a>, the game is now being sold for "hundreds of dollars".</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fjgqwux&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>This includes sealed listings which have sold for up to $399 USD. It's quite a contrast to last year around November, when copies of the title were supposedly selling for under $10.</p>

<p>So, if you happen to have a copy of this DS shovelware on a shelf or packed away in a cupboard or box somewhere and it's in decent or pristine condition, now might be the time to offload it.</p>
<p>When this game was originally released, IGN (one of the few outlets to apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/25/cory-in-the-house-review">upload a professional review</a> when the title launched) said it was "awful" - awarding it a score of three out of ten, and noting how the short-lived experience had "some of the clunkiest controls", "insultingly stupid" presentation and minigames that were "hardly games at all".</p>
