<p>Pokémon, Dragon Quest and much more</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>October is here, and it's another exciting month for Nintendo with the arrival of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> on the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Heck, we've already had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, and this week <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a> returns. Further into this month, Switch and Switch 2 owners can look forward to various other titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Katamari</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and Yacht Club Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> has also been delayed at the last minute, so it will no longer make Halloween.</p>

<p>Ready to save the planet?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Square Enix have published a brand new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, the upcoming Switch 2 version of the 2020 PS4 original --which later got a PS5 upgrade <em>and</em> DLC.</p>
<p>Today's trailer acts as a bit of a rundown of the game's setting, Midgard, as well as the many factions within the sprawling metropolis. If you've already played the game on Sony's consoles or on PC, or even just played the original, you'll be <em>very</em> familiar with these names, but it's still worth a look.</p>
<p>Of course, Midgar is the setting for the entirety of the game — which is essentially the opening area in the OG PS1 release. The city acts as the base of the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation that is monopolising the planet's energy and using it to power Midgar.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6294790c3c26"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6294790c3c26/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If planet-killing technologies weren't enough, then the company also has The Turks, a special task force who are left with "the company's dirty work", often involving assassinations, kidnapping, and other rather unsavoury things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a group opposing Shinra — Avalanche, a group you and Cloud will find yourself aligning with. They’re attempting to stop Shinra's abuse of power and save the planet by destroying Mako Reactors, which siphon the planet's energy.</p>

<p>And of course, to round the video off, we get a little snippet of info on both Cloud and Sephiroth — though it's safe to say <em>everyone</em> has heard of those. Right? <em>Riiiight?</em></p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, has been speaking <em>a lot</em> about the upcoming Switch 2 port lately. He's spoken about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/i-feel-a-great-responsibility-to-get-it-right-naoki-hamaguchi-on-the-pressure-of-remaking-final-fantasy-vii">feeling "a great responsibility"</a> to get the Remake right as well as how the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">team got the lighting just right</a> for this rerelease.</p>
<p>Plus, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">should be getting a demo</a> sometime before the game's 22nd <strong>January 2026</strong> release date, so keep an eye out for that.</p>

<p>More reveals coming next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with a friend in local co-op, then you know how chaotic things can get. Heck, if you've played enough of it on your own and come up with a ridiculous screen-filling build, then you've seen how far you can push the limits.</p>
<p>Well, poncle is <em>finally</em> adding online co-op to the "bullet heaven" game in version 1.14, which is coming this Autumn. Up to four players will be able to join a room and fight their way through various Vampire Survivors stages.</p>
<p>But it's only the first in a line of updates that the developer will be revealing over the course of the next month — with the next reveal coming "next week". Four more updates are coming, so we're waiting with bated (garlic) breath.</p>
<p>For now, here's a rundown of online co-op:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Online Co-Op is coming to Vampire Survivors this Autumn on PC and consoles!</p>
<p>Play online with up to 3 other friends from around the world, just as Poe Ratcho intended. (That’s 4 players in total!)</p>
<p>Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665… More players doesn’t make it easier, or does it?</p>
<p>Autumn is our time to shine, so be sure to come back next week to see what the following card will reveal… we might finally answer a burning question that has been asked thousands of times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game's last free update added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-owners-might-want-to-check-out-this-handy-update-for-vampire-survivors">cross-save to the Switch version back in June 2025</a>. And in April, Square Enix teamed up with Square Enix to make a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/vampire-survivors-and-square-enix-team-up-for-free-dlc-but-its-not-the-series-youd-expect">SaGa-themed DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Will we get a good ol' Switch 2 Edition? Mouse controls? Time will tell!</p>
