<p>To hell with these bugs</p>

<figure data-uuid="4e1835aa8e7a7"><a title="DOOM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e1835aa8e7a7/doom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo and developers have been working to make as many Switch games as possible compatible with the new system.</p>
<p>One of the many titles that has experienced issues on this hybrid device is Bethesda's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a> reboot, which launched in 2016 and eventually made its way to the Switch in 2017 with the help of the talented team at Panic Button.</p>
<p>Although issues with the title on the Switch 2 were thought to have been resolved in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/more-switch-games-receive-compatibility-updates-for-switch-2">compatibility update last November</a>, it appears there are still some problems to iron out. While the title is now officially "supported" in terms of Switch 2 compatibility, according to Nintendo, the "game behaviour may vary from Nintendo Switch".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ojlrqg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The update posted on Nintendo's compatibility site earlier this week on 27th January 2026 mentions how "the game sometimes force closes after autosaving at specific points". For now, it's simply a matter of reopening the title when this happens and to continue playing using the same save data.</p>

<p>So, it's not a major problem, but it's something that's being investigated and will hopefully be resolved sooner rather later. Despite this issue when playing DOOM on the Switch 2, this title, in general, is still a hell of a shooter and a fantastic port from Panic Button.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-increases-just-dance-subscription-prices-in-the-wake-of-restructuring-and-cuts</link>

<p>Just a week after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">Ubisoft announced</a> it was making a huge amount of cuts and cancellations in order to aid efficiency and corporate restructuring, the French studio has confirmed it will be increasing the price of <strong>Just Dance+</strong> subscriptions from <strong>April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The streaming service, which launched back in November 2022, can be used in-game from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/just_dance_2023_edition">Just Dance 2023 Edition</a> onward, and gives you access to even more songs from the series' back-catalogue.</p>
<p>But that'll come at a steeper cost from, with monthly prices rising by <strong>$1</strong> a month, 3-month passes going up <strong>$3</strong>, and a year's pass costing an extra <strong>$5</strong>. Here's a rundown of the before and after:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Month Pass: $<strong>4.99</strong> <strong>/ 4,99€</strong> (previously $3.99 / 3,99€)</li>
<li>3 Month Pass: $<strong>12.99</strong> <strong>/ 12,99€</strong> (previously $9.99 / 9,99€)</li>
<li>12 Month Pass: $<strong>29.99</strong> <strong>/ 29,99€</strong> (previously $24.99 / 24,99€)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, new content is coming in the form of more songs, some of which are available from today, including 'Walking on Sunshine' by Katrina &amp; The Waves, 'Toxic' by Britney Spears, and 'Dynamite' by BTS. A second batch lands on 10th February 2026.</p>
<p>But the timing isn't great timing, especially in the aftermath <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">of last week's news</a>, which saw six games — including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/prince-of-persia-team-behind-cancelled-sands-of-time-remake-shares-final-message">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> — get cancelled, studios get closed down, and restructuring at various offices. All in aid of a live-service push, specialisations, and investments in generative AI.</p>
<p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/surprise-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated">Rayman 30th Anniversary rating has appeared</a> (which is potentially being handled by Atari), but it doesn't look rosy. According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">IGN</a>, the Paris headquarters are looking at a cost-reduction initiative, including a voluntary redundancy process, with French union Solidaires Informatique reportedly planning more action following a call to strike last week (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/anger-and-despair-reigning-supreme-at-ubisoft-following-restructuring-plan-says-union">GamesIndustry.biz</a>).</p>

<p>Batting up in March</p>

<figure data-uuid="55d0ce9c13177"><a title="Aaron Judge MLB The Show 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/55d0ce9c13177/aaron-judge-mlb-the-show-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the arrival of the Switch 2, we've finally been getting some parity across the multiplatform sports games across all consoles, with EA and 2K's offerings being much-better than their Switch 1 counterparts.</p>
<p>We thought we'd see the same from Sony's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_26">MLB The Show 26</a>, which has <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-reveal-aaron-judge/">been confirmed</a> for a <strong>17th March 2026</strong> release alongside the reveal of cover star Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees, who is returning to front for the second time.</p>
<p>But Sony Interactive Entertainment's next entry is opting to stay on the Switch 1 and isn't coming to the Switch 2 right now. Of course, it may be that developer San Diego Studio doesn't have access to Switch 2 dev kits, but it's a rather strange decision from the outside.</p>
<p>As usual, a gameplay reveal will follow next week on <strong>3rd February</strong>, where you'll likely get a small glimpse at Switch gameplay. We're not holding our breath for any improvements, so <em>maybe</em> a Switch 2 port is coming later in the year.</p>

<p>Besides that, pre-orders for the Standard and Digital Deluxe Editions — the latter of which will grant Early Access, allowing you to play the game from13th March (unlikely on Switch, of course) — open after the gameplay reveal on 3rd February at <strong>12 pm EST/ 9 am PST</strong> at certain retailers, digital storefronts, and on the game's <a href="http://theshow.com/">official website</a>.</p>
