</section></header><section>

<p>Although we've been racing around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the past month, there's actually been some activity in the Nintendo mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>.</p>
<p>The game's Pipe Tour is currently back for its second run, and now in another update, Nintendo has announced it will be celebrating the arrival of the Switch 2 game with four new karts as well as some familiar themed outfits for Mario and Luigi.</p>
<p>This Mario Kart World "special campaign" is taking place exclusively in Mario Kart Tour, and is also part of the Sunshine Tour which will run from 23rd July 2025 until 6th August 2025.</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-datamine-suggests-nintendo-isnt-done-with-mario-karts-mobile-entry-just-yet">a rumour in May</a> that Mario Kart Tour would be receiving new content to celebrate Mario Kart World's release.</p>
<p>In some related news, Nintendo has also <a href="https://x.com/SuperMarioRunJP/status/1945741894694416456">announced a new event</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, where you can unlock themed statues to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.

<p>In recent weeks, we've been finding out more details about the developers behind the Switch 2's launch line up of games, and now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio has updated its website with two major projects.</p>
<p>It helped out with not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> but also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. It previously supported Nintendo EPD on projects like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and assisted with multiple other entries in the Mario series during the same generation. You can see the rest of the company's history <a href="https://1-up-studio.jp/company/history.html">on its official website</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4sgnpvy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>According to 1UP's website, its responsibilities on Donkey Kong Bananza included "design, level design, programming" and "part of the sound". As for Mario Kart World, it's mentioned how it assisted with "part of the design". As with many major first-party Nintendo titles nowadays, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/xenoblade_studio_monolith_soft_is_helping_make_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">collaborative efforts like this</a> have become increasingly common.</p>
<p>This follows an update from Nintendo earlier this month, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">"the Super Mario Odyssey team"</a> developed DK and Pauline's latest outing for the Switch 2. We've also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-the-voice-actors-behind-dk-and-pauline">confirmation of the voice actors</a> involved in this new entry.</p>

<p>Now arriving this November</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b78ba65d5ed0/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>After multiple delays, Level-5 has announced it will be delaying its upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> again.</p>
<p>Instead of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-finally-has-release-date-out-on-switch-2-day-one">previous August release date</a>, it's now been pushed back to <strong>13th November 2025</strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms. The latest delay is apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". Here's the scoop, via the game's <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1946252039518044194">official social media account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Announcement Regarding the Release Date</strong></p>
<p>Due to the content volume exceeding our initial expectations, additional time is required for voice recording, multi-language localization, and other related processes. As we work toward the final stages of development, we have decided to adjust the release date to ensure the best possible quality.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<div><p>The release date of "Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road" has been changed from August 21, 2025, to [November 13, 2025 (GMT)].</p><p>

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all the fans who have been eagerly waiting for a long time, and truly appreciate your understanding and continued support.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the video below detailing this delay and it also reiterates how development is apparently in the "final stages". The team believes this next date is when it will "finally be able to release the game".</p>
<p>The same video also highlights the development progress and improved features players can expect when this title does finally arrive. The team does not want to make any compromises and intends to use the extra time to further polish and enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>This delay follows Level-5's launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which got off to a positive start in its opening months – surpassing 1.2 million in "global cumulative sales".</p>
