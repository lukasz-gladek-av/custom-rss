<p>Toby Fox's latest game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> arrived on the Switch 2 alongside the new chapters last month and since then it's been getting some additional patches.</p>
<p>The latest one has now arrived and it bumps the Switch and Switch 2 version up to Version 1.02. It's a "bugfix patch" resolving multiple issues across Chapters 2, 3 and 4. There are also some Switch 2-specific fixes, and there have been some other minor updates made across "all chapters".</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/deltarune-1-02-update-out-now-patch-notes/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<h3>Deltarune (Version 1.02) - 8th July 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the room with fireworks where the floor switch can be pressed by an invisible character.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key Items received from the Ball Machine no longer incorrectly persist outside of that room. This caused numerous issues, including not being able to receive the Shadow Crystal from a certain boss.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Susie and Ralsei would appear completely shadowed if defeated by a boss’s attack.</li>
<li>In a room where Susie destroys houses, she no longer stops moving erroneously after the battle. However, she now slides around erroneously. Apparently, this is better.</li>
<li>Attempted to fix issues on Board 1 where you can see duplicate Ralseis as well as make Ralsei disappear indefinitely.</li>
<li>Fixed some situations where borders were not displaying correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some places where the characters were the normal color in an area that has abnormal coloration.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it’s possible to get temporarily stuck in a playable piano.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue during an optional battle where the damage numbers done to the players were not visible. Additionally, the heal numbers were moving further to the right every time they appeared.</li>
<li>Removed the erroneous appearance of a duplicate Kris in the closet.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed an exploit where you can generate infinite untouchable cats if you touch them with the backside of the shield.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a misalignment of the petting effect and the mouse position.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a crash if you saved your game in the “Mike Zone” on Nintendo Switch, then imported your save file to Nintendo Switch 2 and continued from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All Chapters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Master Volume” setting now persists between Chapters when using the same file.</li>
<li>Updated the save data import messages when first launching the game. Now, if you have more than one app’s save data on your console (for example, if you have saves from both the older version of the Chapter 1&amp;2 demo as well as the newer version), it will display them as a list so you can choose the one you want to import. (Note: The import messages only appear if you have no existing save data for the full version of the game…)</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed an issue where the game displays at the wrong size on 1440p. Additionally, there are several other minor aesthetic fixes across chapters 2, 3, and 4.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The developer also notes how testing of the next patch is "already underway" and the next two patches will contain some "extremely slight adjustments to gameplay in addition to bug fixes".</p>

And in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/46603">Famitsu</a>, where he talks about anime and his love of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, he's particularly gushing about one recent Switch game that he thinks "anyone aspiring to become a game developer" should play.</p>
<p>That title is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and not for the in-game Echoes, summonable monsters, or even the puzzle design. Rather, it's how Nintendo has "used resources" and re-used assets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="AnD-StQ8xqk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea7qotuhv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnD-StQ8xqk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1942432023127417087">Genki on X</a>, Yoshi-P says that he "was particularly impressed" with the top-down Zelda game, even compared to other recent games he's been playing.</p>
<p>"What I am about to talk about is a bit nerdy, but even from a producer's perspective there were many points [in the game] that made me think 'Wow, that's amazing', in terms of how they used resources, how they made it, and the game design."</p>
<p>"The base resources used in the game are almost the same as other Zelda games", the director continues, praising Nintendo's ability to keep costs down "by focusing all the efforts on making the game fun to play." Well, that last point is Nintendo to a tee.</p>

<p>But beyond that, Yoshi-P thinks that Echoes of Wisdom is a great case study for people wanting to get into game development; "I would encourage anyone aspiring to become a game developer or who is just starting their career to try playing this game from that perspective."</p>
<p>That's not the first time game developers have been wowed by a Zelda game — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>'s huge open world and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s incredible Ultrahand and Rewind mechanics had many in-awe back when those games launched. Zelda just has that magic, then.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see some of Yoshi-P's own work on the Switch 2; there have been hints and rumours that ports of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/rumour-final-fantasy-devs-supposedly-hint-at-another-nintendo-release">XVI may be on the cards</a> at some point, but nothing has been confirmed.</p>
