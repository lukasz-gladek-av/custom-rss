<figure data-uuid="0d51ae4299126"><a title="Beyblade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d51ae4299126/beyblade.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, developers have been rolling out all sorts of upgrades for existing titles. With this in mind, the latest one announced is for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyblade_x_evobattle">Beyblade X: Evobattle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong> arrives in Japan today on <strong>18th December 2025</strong>. It is a 1,000 yen paid upgrade for existing Switch owners who purchase the "Upgrade Pack". Local pricing hasn't been announced just yet.</p>
<p>Like other Switch 2 Editions, this upgrade comes with higher resolution graphics and a higher frame rate. There'll also be faster load times (thanks, Gematsu).</p>
<p>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE was launched on the Switch eShop last month. Here's a bit more about it from the Nintendo website:</p>

<p>Evolution 2: EVOSTORY<br>
New allies await—compete, grow, and chase your dreams together in the ultimate BEY BATTLE ROYALE (BBR)!</p>
<p>Evolution 3: EVOCUSTOMIZE<br>
Customization reaches new heights! Collect materials to coat your Beys in your favorite colors, enhance your favorite parts, and choose X Skills to create the perfect Beys for your Battle style!</p>
