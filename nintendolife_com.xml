<p>Now, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-reconfirms-release-windows-for-major-switch-2-games">last one of these</a> that we saw looked <em>super</em> stacked thanks to a bunch of Switch 2 launch titles falling in the quarter, and this one isn't quite as beefy.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00174cf7731d2/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest financial results are live, and the platform holder has confirmed Switch 2 hardware sales "exceeding 6 million units globally in the seven weeks after launch."</p>
<p>Switch 2 launched on 5th June and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">today's Q1 financial report</a> includes figures up to the end of that month. The stated figure of "more than 6 million" accounts for sales past that date, though, to approximately 24th July (seven weeks post-launch).</p>
<p>As of 30th June, Nintendo sold 5.82 million Switch 2s (3.5 million of which were sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">in the first four days</a>) along with 5.63 million copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, including the digital downloads included in the popular Mario Kart hardware bundle. Overall Switch 2 software sales totalled 8.67 million units.</p>
<p>For comparison, the original Switch managed to shift 0.98 million units in the same period, down from 2.1 million in the same quarter last year (-53.5%), bringing it to a lifetime total of 153.10 million units so far. Switch 1 software sales came in at 24.4 million, down from 30.64 million in Q1 last year (-20.4%).</p>
<p>Here's the regional breakdown for Switch 2 hardware sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan: 1.27 million</li>
<li>The Americas: 2.08 million</li>
<li>Europe: 1.34 million</li>
<li>Other: 1.13 million</li>
</ul>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33cb7f24bec8/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> launched to critical acclaim, but isn't included in today's results (it launched in July) — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you'd expect following a successful console launch, gross profit increased 21.4% year-on-year (to 185.1 billion yen), although the lower profit made on the newer hardware meant profit margins declined 29.5 points to 32.3%.</p>
<p>Nintendo's forecast to sell 15 million Switch 2 units this financial year remains unchanged from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">its May forecasts</a>. The company expects to sell 45 million software units in the same period.</p>
<p>The report states that demand for the new system is exceeding supply "in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers."</p>
<hr>
<p><em>tl;dr: Switch 2 sold like hotcakes, Mario Kart World has a crazy-good attach rate (as you'd expect), and Nintendo's new generation is off to a very solid, record-breaking start.</em></p>

<p>New listing says it's a "game on cart"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bd8dd6dd346c/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new wave of Game-Key Card titles have just been announced for the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">following Nintendo's Partner Showcase</a>. Although it seems this type of release won't be stopping any time soon, not every third-party title is necessarily taking this route.</p>
<p>According to a new listing, Digital Eclipse – which has made a name for itself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/atari-50-game-list-every-playable-game-in-the-anniversary-celebration-expanded-edition">reviving various retro game libraries</a> – will be offering the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> on a full game cartridge. This information was shared via the Canadian-based physical game seller and website, Video Games Plus.</p>
<p>The social page makes a special note about how the Nintendo Switch 2 release is on the card. The website also lists a deluxe edition of this physical release for $114.99 CAD, which will apparently contain a "steelbook and other exclusive items" that haven't been revealed just yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Video Games Plus: "Preorders are now live on Day 1 &amp; Deluxe Editions of Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Nintendo Switch, PS5, and NSW2 (Game on Cart)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pre-orders for the standard edition (priced at $79.99 CAD) and deluxe edition of this Legacy Kollection are now live on the same website, but there's no mention on these particular pages about the product being a "game on cart" release, so you might want to hold off until there's a more official confirmation.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of third-party Switch 2 titles have shipped with the entire game on the game card. One of these was CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, with the company even acknowledging the importance of physical media, and to not "underestimate the physical edition" of games.</p>

<p>To send off Nintendo's recent Partner Showcase, Square Enix announced some new projects, and one of them happened to be the brand new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>.</p>
<p>This is an action RPG where the combat will take place in real-time instead of the usual turn-based battles you might be used to in certain other titles. It's also developed by Team Asano (the developers behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default</a>).</p>
<p>In case you missed it, a demo is now available on the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms, and Square Enix has issued a reminder about this along with some information about what to expect if you haven't already played it:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ymqtun&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This ‘Debut Demo’ is designed to give you a sense of the exploration and action you’ll experience in the game, so expect plenty of crunchy combat, spooky caves and all kinds of secrets hidden around.</p>
<p>See a crackable wall? Blow it to smithereens with a bomb and you might discover a Secret Treasure Route- a small dungeon you can explore for valuable rewards.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find a Shrine of Life - these optional challenges put your combat and traversal skills to the test. Perhaps you’ll find valuable loot like magicite or money. Always remember - this is a game that rewards the curious.</p>
<p>Or, you could follow the quest markers and delve into a deadly swamp, and the Unexplored Ruins beneath. This multi-level dungeon is full of dangers - so be sure to use everything you’ve learned to find your way through.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco officially lifted the lid on Switch and Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> in this week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.</p>
<p>This game will be coming to Nintendo's platforms later this year on <strong>14th November 2025</strong> and pre-orders are available now. It follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">a rating for this platform earlier this year</a> in Saudi Arabia. This latest game is powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>It's also mentioned in the PR how these versions of the game will come with local multiplayer and motion controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO takes the legendary gameplay of the Budokai Tenkaichi series and raises it to whole new levels. Become a super warrior and experience the earth-shaking, limit-breaking power of Dragon Ball battles!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This title is available for <strong>$59.99</strong> digitally on the Switch and Switch 2 (or the regional equivalent), and pre-orders are once again live. There are also Deluxe and Ultimate Editions featuring Season Pass content and DLC.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the video above, there will also be an update for the Switch physical and digital versions of this game, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>

<p>It's scheduled to arrive in 2025</p>

<p>Masahiro Sakurai's latest project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> soars onto the Switch 2 at some point later this year.</p>
<p>While we haven't heard all that much about it since the initial announcement in April, the game has reportedly been rated in Saudi Arabia recently – receiving an age rating in this location of "7 and above" (<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/31/kirby-air-riders-for-nintendo-switch-2-has-been-rated-in-saudi-arabia/">via My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>Sakurai did provide a small update about this title earlier in July, mentioning how it was "shaping up to be something great". This also happened to be timed in with the 22nd anniversary of the original GameCube title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>.</p>
<p>The classification for this title hopefully means a release isn't too far away. If this new Kirby racer does make its 2025 window, it will join other racing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo releases coming to the Switch this year include titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and the Koei Tecmo project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was featured during this week's Partner Direct.</p>

<p>The new entry arrives this October</p>

<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Switch 2 Partner Showcase</a> has just revealed what's ahead for the new hybrid platform in terms of third-party offerings, but it seems one series that won't be showing up any time soon is EA's popular military shooter Battlefield.</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke to Battlefield's head Vince Zempella as part of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI">multiplayer reveal today</a>, and it's been officially confirmed the company "doesn't currently" have plans to bring the game to Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>The team is focused on delivering the game where the "core Battlefield audience is present", according to the same story.</p>
<p>EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">official FAQ for Battlefield 6</a> further confirms how the new entry, which launches on <strong>10th October 2025</strong>, will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (including the Steam, EA App, and Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>Although EA won't be delivering Battlefield 6 on the Switch 2, earlier today the third-party giant announced it would be releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants Vs Zombies: Replanted</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, following a series of rumours. EA will also be bringing the latest entries in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a> series to the new platform as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>This news about Battlefield follows on from Microsoft and Activision revealing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">would be released on Nintendo platforms</a> going forward.</p>
