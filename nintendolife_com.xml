<p>But it will have "full crossplay"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bcb028bc3af9/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> for the Switch 2, we've had a number of updates from Randy Pitchford and the team at Gearbox Software about what exactly fans can expect.</p>
<p>Following the news last month the game would run at "mostly" 30fps (instead of 60fps) on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware, we've now got another Switch 2-related update. This was spotted in the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNQ5NRRFJZ170AXZSQYQ7">game's official FAQ</a>, which was updated earlier this month.</p>
<p>This version will apparently offer "the same exciting" experience as other platforms "minus the split-screen option". Although this is missing, the same paragraph notes how the Nintendo release will have crossplay support with the other platforms. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full crossplay with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you were hoping to enjoy some split-screen action on a single Switch 2 device, it seems you may need to instead consider the game on another console platform for this particular option.</p>
<p>It was also confirmed not long ago how the Switch 2 physical release of Borderlands 4 will require a download, so expect a Game-Key Card release. This game launches for this platform on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>He's aware fans haven't even seen gameplay yet</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56c21bd8dc43d/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the many surprises during the Switch 2 reveal in April was the new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, a sequel to the GameCube outing.</p>
<p>It's scheduled to arrive later this year, so what's the latest? Game director Masahiro Sakurai has issued another small update <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1956187495991009776">via social media today</a>, mentioning how he thinks the team should be able to share some information about this game soon.</p>
<p>This small update on this project about Kirby's new game lines up with Sora's 20th anniversary in 2025 – with Sakurai thanking fans for their "continued support" over the years. Here's a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Masahiro Sakurai:</strong> "It doesn't matter to most people, but today, Sora Co., Ltd. is celebrating its 20th anniversary. …That's a long time! Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>"The new game *Kirby Air Rider* hasn't even shown gameplay footage yet, but I think we'll be able to share some information soon. Please wait!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest update on Kirby Air Riders follows the game getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">classification last month</a>. Sakurai also mentioned in July how the title was "shaping up to be something great".</p>
<p>Again, Kirby Air Riders is scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, so hopefully we'll at least get some gameplay footage soon. In the meantime, you can take another look at the announcement cinematic.</p>

<p>Scalpers are reportedly at it again, and this time they're targeting exclusive merch available at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, there are already eBay listings popping up for the commemorative Pikachu plush, themed TCG playmats, card binders, the <a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1955663752457810413">jukebox</a> and various other items available at the event taking place in Anaheim, California this weekend.</p>
<p>Although there's a "one-per-person" rule in place at the venue, scalpers are still taking advantage of the fact the merch is currently exclusive to this event. Some of the community is already highlighting the scenes at the World Championships, as well as the resellers and online listings.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fpmyizw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's one post, in particular, that's been called out by the Pokémon community. And below this are some scenes from the Pokémon Center pop-up at the event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Selling 2025 worlds bearwalker and shiny gyarados statue. $1000 on bearwalker and $600 on shiny gyarados statue. Payment up front. Zelle/PP FF/cashapp preferably. Pm me if interested. Thanks"</p>
</blockquote>






<p>It's sad to see this sort of behaviour, as it continues to ruin the hobby for many legitimate Pokémon fans and collectors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this follows a story earlier this week about McDonald's Japan having to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">pull its Pokémon TCG Happy Meal promotion</a> after 24 hours because of similar issues tied to scalping – with one customer supposedly attempting to buy 40 Happy Meals. The fast food giant even issued a formal apology.</p>

<p>If you happen to be heading to the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California this weekend, you can receive a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> distribution.</p>
<p>When you enter the badge pickup zone at the venue, you'll receive a unique code for a Toedscool. It's apparently "based on the Toedscool on this year's key art" for the World Championships (<a href="https://serebii.net/">thanks, Serebii.net</a>). You'll need to redeem this code in-game by <strong>August 29, 2025</strong>. Here's a look:</p>

<p>If we hear anything about an online distribution, we'll let you know. For now, if you want to get your hands on this, you'll need to attend this weekend's event, which takes place between <strong>August 15 - 17, 2025</strong>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:140671 @ 1755238495 -->
<p>Apart from this, the Pokémon World Championships will also be offering trainers a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/tune-in-to-worlds-to-get-luca-ceribellis-farigiraf-and-other-special-gifts">special Farigiarf this weekend</a>.

<p>To obtain this Pokémon, you'll need to watch the official 2025 Worlds livestream for a password you can then use in the Mystery Gift feature of Scarlet and Violet. The password can only be used one time "per save", and it expires on <strong>August 22, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>You can see the full schedule for the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in our previous post. There's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-a-playable-switch-2-demo-appearing-at-upcoming-events">also a Switch 2 demo</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> at this event. This follows on from a free Switch 2 upgrade for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in June, which included frame rate improvements and a higher resolution update.</p>

It all kicks off at <strong>3:45 pm EST on Friday 10th October</strong> — we've listed times for the showcase below, but note that these NYCC panels aren't often broadcast unless you pay for <a href="https://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/en-us/memberships.html">Popverse membership</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7vyownr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, this is far from the first time Capcom has been to Comic-Con — the company has attended multiple times over the years. But In terms of Switch and Switch 2 games, the only real new game appearance is likely to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>. But we may get a look at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC too?</p>
<p>However, we'd recommend that you don't get your hopes up <em>too</em> much for any major announcements. But really, we'd love to see some <strong>Mega Man</strong>. C'mon, Capcom! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mega-man-is-one-of-capcoms-most-important-ips-despite-no-new-games-in-7plus-years">You said it was one of your "most-important IPs!"</a></p>

<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158067/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>While playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> for this review, I visited an exhibition at London’s Science Museum: <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/power">Power Up</a> – a hands-on tour of the last five decades of video games. There, in an expansive, dark basement, an orange-illuminated wall of computers and consoles took me right through the 1980s. I sampled such delicacies as a flickery <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/spectrum/chuckie_egg">Chuckie Egg</a> on the BBC Micro, an Asteroids-type game on the Vectrex, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> on the NES. It was like an 8-bit time machine, beep-blooping me into any year I fancied, to have a little taste of what was there.</p>
<p>UFO 50 is just like that – except the time machine has taken a wrong turn and ended up in a parallel universe. Here, a pioneering (fictional) company, UFO Soft, produced a snazzy home console called the Lazer-X, then prolifically churned out games for it over eight years from 1982 to 1989. The IRL developers – a group of six indie devs at Mossmouth (Derek Yu’s studio behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a>) – calling themselves the “UFO 50 Recovery Team”, unearthed this machine. They also rescued 50 of its games, so the story goes, and lovingly restored them so that players could transport themselves back through “history”.</p>

<p>And talk about committing to the bit. UFO 50 opens with the credits (otherwise you’d need to get through 50 games to see them, I guess), in which the team is seen in lo-fi photos finding and rescuing the Lazer-X and its games. Then, you see a screenful of 50 disks, navigated using only the d-pad and two buttons found on the Lazer-X itself. Highlighting a game gives you only the slightest information, immediately creating a sense of exploration. Each equally alluring, it’s almost impossible to choose where to start. Thinking I’d need to play them all for this review, I went chronologically, jumping in with 1982’s <em>Barbuta</em>.</p>
<p>One distinctive thing about the games of the '80s was how unfair they could sometimes be. No tutorials, no hand-holding, but a lot of trial and error. I won’t spoil it, but the first button-press of the first game of the anthology is a joke riffing on that – and a pretty good one, too. 'Barbuta' is a rudimentary Metroidvania which, while rather inscrutable, is full of charm. Before I knew it, an hour had disappeared, and I realised I’d only illuminated one of the icons on the jam-packed game selection screen. Pushing on in chronological order was going to be too workmanlike, so I just started to browse. And that’s where the joy of UFO 50 really comes out.</p>

<p>In an <strong>Edge</strong> magazine interview in 2024, co-developer and composer Eirik Suhrke explained that the overwhelming one-time dump of 50 games – not gated, not structured – was intended to conjure the feeling of picking through shareware titles or demo discs. You might also say it’s like scrolling through a pile of ROMs. It’s the opposite of squeezing every last drop out of the one game you got for Christmas as a kid: nothing needs to be played for more than a few moments if you don’t want to. Switching games is so rapid and frictionless that the huge catalogue soon merges into one singular game experience.</p>
<p>You might compare it to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare</a> in that regard, but while Wario’s sequences of micro-games immediately dissolved into just one uber-game, the parts of UFO 50 are much more substantial, and the overall game therefore absolutely epic. Its component parts may include relatively throwaway arcade titles, like 'Magic Garden' and 'Ninpek' (although even those bring some good ideas), but there’s also a fully fledged JRPG, a brilliant deck builder, multiple puzzle games, platformers, sequels to those platformers…. These are 50 <em>full games</em>, ready to pick up and put down, like you’re strolling around the Science Museum’s exhibits. Some will land with you, some won’t, but the luxury of having them all there means you’ll dip into genres you might not normally go for. You need only play any game for as long as your curiosity lasts – but too many of them caught me off guard, and the hours disappeared unnoticed.</p>

<p>In a way, of course, UFO 50 is a study of the real history of games – the conventions, technologies and design principles that all had to find their feet in those early years. But since this is just one interpretation of game history, it’s very strongly subjective. As such, it’s not exclusionary – not the private domain of experts or older players: a 12-year-old in 2025 could pick this all up without ever having seen a CRT. It’s particularly interesting then to consider the personal gaming history of the developers – wouldn’t it be fascinating to know what shaped their fantasy of gaming’s growth through the 80s? Luckily enough, Derek Yu appeared on <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/derek-yu-gamemaker-spelunky-ufo-50">the podcast My Perfect Console</a> when UFO 50 launched on Steam, and shared just that.</p>
<p>He told of his experience of <strong>NetHack</strong>, a 1987 roguelike. More than the game itself, the fascination was that he found it on a disk in his house and loaded it up in DOS, not even knowing whether it was a game at all. The pure mystery of that comes across when diving into some random option in UFO 50. Yu also talked about his dad drawing maps of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> – perhaps no surprise, then, that 'Barbuta' features a blank grid in the corner of the UI, practically shouting at you to get your graph paper, like a pixelated maths teacher.</p>
<p>While the joyous mystery of flicking through disks is all there by design, there’s one unplanned fact about UFO 50: it took a real-world <em>eight years</em> to make – not the usual two or three. That in itself is an enticing story: while there are rich snippets of the history of UFO Soft’s games and growth, I’d lap up a version of the game that spelled out the true history of Mossmouth and its eight-year quest. Which games came first? What led to what? How were all the inevitable ups and downs?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What stands out about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, Mossmouth’s delightful collection of retro-styled games, is not that so many of them are absolute bangers – although they are – rather, it’s the fact that it genuinely all comes together as a single experience. In this game, you are a visitor in some wonderful exhibition, and UFO 50 is your 8-bit time machine. It's magnificent, and a perfect fit for Switch.</p></section>
