<p>Including a collection</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Legacy of Kain series will be returning with <strong>Legacy of Kain: Defiance Remastered</strong> and Legacy of Kain: Ascendance.</p>
<p>Both of these titles are coming to the Switch 2 and Switch. Defiance Remastered will be released on <strong>3rd March 2026</strong> and Ascendance is arriving on <strong>31st March 2026</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Legacy of Kain: Defiance Remastered</strong> is a timeless dark fantasy reborn for a new generation. Return to the dark world of Nosgoth as you take control of both the vampire Kain and his betrayed lieutenant, Raziel, two powerful entities bound by the conflict between fate and free will.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>A prequel to <em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</em>, <strong><em>Legacy of Kain: Ascendance</em></strong> is a fast-paced, 2D action platformer built around vertical movement, fluid combat, and skill-driven play, with select PS1 era–inspired 3D sequences. Story and narrative are key to the experience, woven directly into gameplay, cutscenes, and world design. Beautifully crafted retro pixel-art gameplay and anime-influenced cinematics bring Nosgoth’s dark fantasy world to life, telling a new story set in a vast world of collapsing kingdoms, haunted ruins, and shattered timelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will also be a Heart of Darkness Collection, including both games. This post will be updated soon with more details.</p></section></article></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/two-legacy-of-kain-titles-are-on-the-way-to-switch-2-and-switch-this-march]]></content:encoded>
