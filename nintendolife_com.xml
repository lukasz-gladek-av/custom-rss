<figure><a title="three new switch ray tracing patents" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d60094e084873/three-new-switch-ray-tracing-patents.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, we already know that the ability to use ray tracing is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/digital-foundry-says-switch-2-running-switch-games-at-4k-is-quite-the-thing-in-performance-breakdown">built into the Switch 2 console</a>, baked into its very fibre, as an entirely untechnical person might say. However, we've yet to be presented with any examples of it in action on the new machine just yet.</p>
<p>Well, as disappointing as it may be to not have had Mario's shiny face reflecting back on itself in real time from the get-go, Nintendo does seem to be up to something, at the very least, with regards to the tech. In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lsisrfobvk2d">recent social media post</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> has highlighted three patents published yesterday in Japan, two of which have ray tracing antics in mind.</p>

<p>So, what are we looking at here, then? Well, as detailed by the post, the first two images show details of ray tracing techniques that improve both the amount of control the tech has on a per-object basis, as well as correctional adjustments for around screen edges. This is on top of a third patent that covers an improved shadow-mapping technique.</p>
<p>So, while we don't have any info on what all this is exactly, it sure does look like tweaks and adjustments, or just some further info, on whatever is already going on inside our Switch 2 consoles (which Nintendo has been vague on so far) with regards to ray tracing.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to seeing how ray tracing actually pans out on Switch 2? What games do you think will, or should, employ it first? Let us know!</em></p>

<figure><a title="dying light retouched skipping switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44af56b96e174/dying-light-retouched-skipping-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Techland</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dying_light_definitive_edition">Dying Light</a> is one of those absolutely huge games that just shouldn't really work on a Switch. It's way too big, it's way too pretty, and it's way too action-packed. Or at least that's what we thought, until Techland served us up a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/dying-light-platinum-edition">solid port of its excellent zombie survival epic</a> that ran just fine on Nintendo's dinky little machine. The wizards!</p>
<p>Now, however, it seems as though we may not be getting treated to any more magic, for the time-being at least, from this particular Polish dev. Yes, as detailed on <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">Techland's official blog</a> (thank you, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-1-gets-free-audio-and-visual-enhancements-this-week-but-they-wont-be-coming-to-switch">Eurogamer</a>), the Switch version of Dying Light will be skipping the brand new 'Retouched' update that's bringing a bunch of audio and visual slickness to versions on other, more powerful hardware.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067oirhkj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As disappointing as this is at first blush, the details of the upgrade do make it fairly clear that the Switch doesn't make the cut for the sort of graphical advancements being discussed here (8k ultra-detailed shadows, anyone?). Indeed everything being added here is to take advantage of next-gen machines, so we guess fans who are Switch-only players will have to make do with they've got in the vanilla release.</p>
<p>Further to all of this, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-retouched-update-isnt-coming-to-nintendo-switch-as-techland-denies-plans-for-switch-2-port">IGN also reached out to Techland</a> and were told the following with regards to Nintendo's consoles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When it comes to a Switch 2 port of the original Dying Light: We have no plans at this moment...We're currently fully focused on delivering Dying Light: The Beast on August 22, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. We have no news to share about Nintendo Switch 2 at this time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it really does seem as though, for now, the Switch family of consoles is being left out of the vision for Dying Light going forward. Guess it's gonna be replay the original or check out one of the other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-zombie-games-on-nintendo-switch">fantastic zombie games on Switch instead...</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Dying Light fan? Feeling left out or is this fairly understandable overall? Make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p></section>

<p>Let's have a World Party!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Team17 and Digital Eclipse have unleashed the latest update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> on the Switch, adding three additional retro games to the title.</p>
<p>So not only can you play <strong>Worms Armageddon</strong> and its charming Game Boy Color counterpart, but you now also have access to the SNES version of <strong>Worms</strong>, the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive version, and <strong>Worms World Party</strong> for the GBA.</p>
<p>Granted, there are still a boatload of Worms games to cover, but what was originally a neat little throwback to a single entry in the franchise is slowly morphing into a wider celebration of creator Andy Davidson's remarkably addictive series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In addition to the extra games, a ‘Boggy B’ cheat code has been added based on community feedback, and basically unlocks all content in the game immediately. Get in! This is also toggleable in the main menu, for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p>We reviewed Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition last year and called it "another slam dunk for Digital Eclipse and its ongoing mission of game preservation and historical documentation". It received a well-deserved score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition">9/10</a>.</p>
<p>For now, let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Re-live 1999 with this faithful rendition of Worms™ Armageddon. With all the hilarious fun and madness you know and love.</p>
<p>- New Display features to suit modern hardware.</p>
<p>- An interactive documentary about Worms Armageddon alongside a museum timeline charting the history of the series.</p>
<p>- Also included is a fully playable version of the game released for Gameboy Color.</p>
<p>- Use over 55 classically weird and wonderful weapons and tools including Earthquake, Freeze and French Sheep Strike.</p>
<p>- Play single-player Deathmatch plus an exciting 40+ mission campaign</p>
<p>- Over 30 custom and comedy sound banks (including stiff upper lip, Cyberworms and more).</p>
<p>- Beloved features from the multi-player mode: Handicapping (add or deduct energy for a team), Allied Teams (team up with others to target another player), ‘Worms Disease’, Home Runs and many, many more.</p>

<p>As we reported just a little while ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/everybodys-golf-hot-shots-brings-the-par-tee-to-switch-this-september">Everybody's Golf will be swinging onto Nintendo Switch</a> this September 5th in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hotshots</a>.</p>
<p>Following on from the reveal of the official release date, Bandai Namco has now dropped a juicy video showing almost five whole minutes of gameplay. You can check out the trailer above, and we have to say, it's all looking pretty much as expected for a series that certainly has its own unique thing going on.</p>
<p>Here's some delicious PR deets from Bandai Namco to tell us even more!</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Tons of Customization</strong> - Customize stats, clubs and balls to match every character’s play style</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Largest Roster</strong> – With a series-leading 25+ playable characters available, build up character loyalty to unlock new shots, including spin shots, homing shots and character-specific special shots.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Caddie</strong> <strong>Support</strong> - Team up with caddies to get detailed play tips, support skills, and more.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Challenge Mode</strong> Join tournaments in solo play to fight to the top! Unlock more characters, scenarios and even bigger tournaments to become the ultimate golfer.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>World Tour</strong> – Spanning 10 regions across the globe, discover charming character interactions unique to each player.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Wacky Golf</strong> – This brand new mode brings chaos to the course with obstacles, challenges, and more in either solo or multiplayer mode, including Colorful, Scramble, Survival Golf and Dokkan Golf modes.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, Everybody's Golf Hotshots has raised a few eyebrows lately after its Steam page disclosed the minor detail that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/hot-shots-golf-fans-fume-at-use-of-generative-ai-in-ps5-revival">some of its background foliage is created using generative AI</a>, which is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/smash-bros-director-sakurai-laments-unsustainable-aaa-game-dev-discusses-ai-and-uncertainty">certainly a hot topic of debate at the moment</a> (and not a good look, in all honesty),so it's up to you to decide where the line is drawn on that particular aspect of this one.</p>
<p>One thing we don't get any news on here, unfortunately, is whether or not we can expect any kind of Switch 2 version, but perhaps that's something for further down the line. We'll keep you posted!</p>
