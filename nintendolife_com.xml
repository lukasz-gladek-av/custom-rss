<p>Sow much fun</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section></header><section><p>When I reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> for Switch before its release, I said the newest entry was a "must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>
<p>Now, having played the game on Switch 2, I can safely say that Guardians of Azuma is still an inventive twist on a beloved series, but there are a few upgrades that make this killer entry in the Rune Factory series even more compelling on the newest Nintendo console.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182553 @ 1751997607 -->
<p>For anyone who already owns the game on Switch, you can purchase a $10 upgrade for Switch 2 that adds mouse functionality for easier building placement and improved graphics which includes a resolution bump and higher frame rate, which now aims for 60fps and largely stays consistent.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, I played the base version of the game on the newer console for a few hours, and it still felt like a slight improvement over playing it before, likely thanks to playing it on a better machine. The larger screen in particular made everything feel more cinematic. If you don’t feel like purchasing the upgrade separately, you’ll still have a great time with the game without it.</p>
<p>That being said, the Switch 2 Edition improvements to the experience are definitely noticeable. Everything is a bit sharper and faster, which I found particularly nice in busier combat situations and as my villages began to grow in size and complexity. And, while I didn’t personally have many distracting performance issues playing the game originally, it feels like it was made specifically for the more-powerful console. The upgrade takes what was already a thoughtful and beautiful gameplay experience to the next, pristine level.</p>
<p>The only mechanical difference is the new mouse functionality, which automatically kicks in when using the Joy-Con 2 mouse in build mode. When building your town, the mouse controls are undoubtedly helpful in creating interesting town designs, but it can be accessed using a regular controller as well. As a result, building is slightly faster, but I generally play in either handheld mode or docked mode with a controller and found removing the Joy-Con 2 just to build somewhat tedious. I’d call the mouse mode a cool addition but not necessary for a rich play experience.</p>
<p>On the whole, Guardians of Azuma is a stellar experience on any platform, with the Switch 2 offering that extra touch of greatness. Those who are particularly sensitive to performance issues will find themselves in safer hands with the upgrade, so long as you're willing to pay an upcharge for the privilege.</p></section></article><div><p>Jess is a writer and game designer based in Chicago.

<p>Say hello to 'Ninsight'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ninsight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/602666d8c3dbf/ninsight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ninty Media</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ninty Media, the team behind magazines such as The Vita Lounge, Switch Player, and Ninty Fresh, has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nintymedia/ninsight-the-new-nintendo-switch-2-magazine">Kickstarter campaign</a> for a new venture called 'Ninsight'.</p>
<p>With the first issue shipping globally in August, Ninsight aims to provide the latest Nintendo-themed news, reviews, and talking points in a premium, 80-100 page magazine with zero adverts. At the time of writing, over half of the Kickstarter's £5,000 goal has been achieved with 16 days remaining.</p>
<p>According to the overview, the move over to Ninsight was due to rising costs in maintaining production for Switch Player. Moving over to a new model which focuses on fewer releases and higher-quality content will hopefully result in a more viable business long-term.</p>

<p>You can offer up a pledge right now if you wish, with digital copies of the magazine costing £4 and physical versions costing £7. A premium edition at £20 will also include an art print of the cover art and a poster. Backers of the premium edition will also get an enamel pin badge and their names in the mag.</p>
<p>So if you miss the days of NGamer and ONM, then this might well be worth a punt. We'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it!</p>
