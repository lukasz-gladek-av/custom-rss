<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdfc4f3f7d5ae/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many libraries offer services where you can experience and even borrow video games. Unfortunately, a 45-year-old Oakland man named Jamal Reed-Obafumi has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from Marin County Libraries, located in Northern California.</p>
<p>Marin County's Sheriff's Detectives arrested Reed-Obafumi last week after he was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". This took place between April and June 2025 across multiple branches.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pgwhiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The Sheriff's Office further notes how he has been "booked" into the Marin County Jail and is currently facing 12 felony charges, including multiple counts of burglary and committing a felony while out on bail. It's further noted how libraries "must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy" as they are a pillar of the community.</p>
<p>According to GameSpot, the Marin County Library <a href="https://marinlibrary.bibliocommons.com/v2/search?query=Switch&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;f_FORMAT=VIDEO_GAME">reportedly has a catalog of over "200 Switch games available to borrow"</a>. It's not mentioned if any of the games have been recovered. This follows a story last week about more than 2,800 Switch 2 consoles being stolen from a semi-truck in Texas. You can find out more about this in our previous story.</p>

<figure><a title="Fox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b164f9c87126b/fox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Professional <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> player Joseph 'Mang0' Marquez has today been dropped by his main sponsor 'Cloud9' due to "<a href="https://x.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1936735705905909912">inappropriate conduct</a>" at a recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/rPTkt74KXgo">"Beerio Kart" tournament</a> hosted by streamer and internet personality Ludwig Aghren.</p>
<p>This 11-year sponsorship marks the end of "one of the longest partnerships" in esports history, as detailed by Sports Illustrated. According to the same source, Aghren banned Marquez from all of his future events for "multiple inappropriate actions towards other creators, including multiple women" while intoxicated.</p>
<p>Cloud9 followed this with an "internal evaluation" and has now released the following statement about how it maintains a "zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct" and would be immediately releasing Marquez.</p>

<p>Marquez responded to this acknowledging how he had "no one to blame" but himself, and never thought he could "hit this low" while apologising to "everyone". He also mentioned how this will "probably" get him banned from future tournaments, although there's no official update about this right now.</p>
<p>"Beerio Kart" is described as a drinking game where players drink alcohol and race in Mario Kart. Aghren's event was unofficial and was not endorsed by Nintendo.</p>
<p>Marquez has won multiple major Smash Bros. tournaments over the years and is considered to be one of the greatest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> players of all time after success with characters like Jigglypuff, Fox and Falco.</p>

In case you're not familiar with it, it's basically Mario Kart's take on the battle royale genre, where it's the last kart standing as racers are eliminated after each section of the course.</p>
<p>It's now almost been one month since the new entry hit the track and it's got us wondering how much success our community has had so far in this new mode. Have you won a race yet? Have you been on the cusp of greatness but denied by a blue shell at the last minute? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments below.</em></p>

<figure><a title="Deltarune" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/062dc13500b56/deltarune.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the many games to launch alongside the Switch 2 earlier this month was Toby Fox's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> game.</p>
<p>Although there's still more to come, a new patch update has now been rolled out for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 on Nintendo's new hardware. This also includes fixes for the Switch version. It's noted how this update "mostly includes fixes from PC hotfixes 1.01A and 1.01B.</p>
