<p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in February. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There’s no question that Nintendo makes some of the best video games in the world thanks to its incredibly skilled and passionate in-house and partner developers. But how often does the company let those developers speak freely about the games they make?</p>
<p>Last year we got the opportunity to chat with the legendary artist <strong>Takaya Imamura</strong>, famous for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, Captain Falcon and the many machines in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora’s Mask</a> itself. He was with Nintendo for over 30 years working on countless games until leaving the company in 2021 to pursue something different. So, naturally, we said 'Yes!' and flew thousands of miles to sit down with the man himself.</p>
<p>Imamura-san is now coming back to gaming with his new project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">OMEGA 6: The Triangle Stars</a>, an adventure inspired by his own manga. In this interview, we speak about the upcoming game, his days working on games like Zelda, and why he left Nintendo after all those years...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): Omega 6 looks a lot like a long-lost Super Famicom game. How long have you had the idea for this game in your head?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takaya Imamura:</strong> So it’s actually pretty new as a concept. It’s derived from the manga. The idea wasn’t there from the beginning. I wrote the manga, then the chance to create a game based on it came up.</p>

<p><strong>In that regard, what do you love about working outside of Nintendo and how is developing a game different now for you?</strong></p>
<p>Now I enjoy it. I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>Did we hear correctly that you’re a professor as well? How do you juggle all of that?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, as a professor I’m teaching students, they come to class at a certain time, there’s summer holidays and I know when I need to work and when I don’t. Like Indiana Jones. [makes whip-cracking sound]</p>
<p><strong>Are you a big Indiana Jones fan?</strong></p>
<p>Yea, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to play <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">The Great Circle</a> when that comes out?</strong></p>
<p>Ahh, of course!</p>
<p><strong>What has it been like being a teacher and a famous game developer? Do you have students that know of and are fans of your work?</strong></p>
<p>There are some like that, but the majority don’t really know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>Wow! That’s so interesting! I feel if you were a teacher in the US or the UK people would react differently to you being their teacher.</strong></p>
<p>Even students who really look up to me tend to hold back during class. It’s when we go out for a meal or drinks then they ask if I’ll sign or draw something!</p>
<p><strong>It’s nice that there’s a time and place for that sort of thing. To get back to Omega 6, what was your biggest inspiration for the art direction?</strong></p>
<p>Once I left Nintendo, I was thinking, 'How can I do something on my own as a creative?' The easiest and first thing that came to mind was to make a comic since I can draw. I really wasn’t thinking of how I could sell the comic and make money, I just really wanted to draw this comic. If I can put it digitally on Kindle and a few people buy it? Great!</p>
<p><strong>The game itself has a massive roster of characters, and I love how there’s a list of them all that you can flip through. Are you sharing design duties with anyone else or are they all created by you?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you! Basically it was all me except there are four characters in there that my students designed. I did the pixel art for those few characters but my students came up with the original designs.</p>

<p><strong>That’s amazing! You directed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/steel_diver">Steel Diver</a> and have worked on plenty of other games with Nintendo over your many years there, but when’s the last time you’ve gotten to express yourself in this way?</strong></p>
<p>It’s the first time I’ve been this free, because there’s nobody to tell me 'No', or to tell me when to stop. I just do what I want as much as I want.</p>
<p>When I was at Nintendo, or when you’re doing something in a professional environment and the project has milestones that people have to check off, you get senior people like the producers and managers that say, “Alright, you need to reel this one in,” or, “Let's not do this.” Ya know, I really never liked that. I think for pretty much anybody who is a professional game developer, this is something they’ll go through. Of course, you know, when you’re at a company, the company has to make money!</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember what it was that made you want to leave Nintendo? You’d been there for many years, but it’s a dream for many to work there.</strong></p>
<p>It’s actually pretty simple. I quit when I was 65. This is the same for anybody, but life is short. We’ve only got a number of years on this earth and there’s a limit to the amount of things you can do with that time. I was kind of mulling over that and at the same time I got an invitation from the university to come and teach and I thought, 'Whoa, this is an opportunity to change things.'</p>
<p><strong>This was three or four years ago, right?</strong></p>
<p>I left in 2021!</p>
<figure data-uuid="4424d263ea05b"><a title="Takaya Imamura outside Nintendo HQ in Kyoto" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4424d263ea05b/takaya-imamura-outside-nintendo-hq-in-kyoto.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1351786503815397376">Nintendo Life / @ima_1966</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What are a few things you miss working at Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p>For the first six months or so after leaving Nintendo, I kept dreaming I was still going to work. I’d start developing a game and then I’d wake up and go, “Oh, oh. Okay that’s weird.”</p>
<p>I actually met with Shigeru Miyamoto once after I left and I said, “Hey, long time no see!” But I actually didn’t feel like that was true since I was seeing him in my dreams all the time. He got a good laugh out of that.</p>
<p><strong>You were at Nintendo for such a long time, so were you pretty close with a lot of your colleagues?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I still keep in contact with all of them. For example, the director of Animal Crossing, Aya Kyogoku, is coming out to see me teach in the classroom in October.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, really?! Is she going to be speaking or just sitting in to observe?</strong></p>
<p>She’s just coming over for a chat! If I have her give a lecture or something like that, then she’s gotta ask Nintendo and it has to be approved.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel for you to be able to pass on all the things you’ve learned to a newer generation?</strong></p>
<p>It’s very difficult because if I was to host a speech, lots of people would come and listen, I think. When we turn it into a formal lecture, then there’s people who are like, “Ughhh, I don’t wanna be here.” People sleep in class, so it’s like any lecture in school.</p>

<p><strong>So I know you’re very famous for creating Tingle - was there anything specific that really inspired you to make him?</strong></p>
<p>The background and the lore of the character was decided beforehand and I was only responsible for the visuals. Basically, I found a guy on the team and drew a caricature and there was Tingle!</p>
<p><strong>That seems to be a running theme for you, taking members of your team and putting them in the game! You did this with Star Fox, Falco and Slippy too, yeah?</strong></p>
<p>I’m pretty good at caricatures. With Star Fox, it wasn’t a direct caricature but instead I was taking inspiration from different people. But yeah, that is one of the ways I do it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="652e38f36eafb"><a title="Star Wolf characters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/652e38f36eafb/star-wolf-characters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So you’re saying there’s a real-life Tingle roaming around in the world?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>We know there were a lot of character designs that were carried over from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to Majora’s Mask but did you design any other characters in that game?</strong></p>
<p>The only real NPC I made was Tingle, but I designed the Moon and Majora’s Mask and that was kind of iconic. I was the art director, so I wasn’t designing the actual characters, more setting the overall theme and direction for the art.</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember why you were tasked with designing Tingle then? Did someone on the team want you to do it?</strong></p>
<p>It was just a coincidence really. Everyone else was busy so someone asked me, “Hey, could you do this one?” and I said, "Sure!"</p>
<p><strong>Majora’s Mask was developed in a very short amount of time, which sounds like it could be really stressful, but when you think back to that time making that game, is there anything that stands out? A funny moment, maybe the way you bonded with a coworker, or a way you made yourself proud?</strong></p>
<p>It was a really short project compared to general Nintendo timelines, so everybody was really focused on getting it done. So there really wasn’t much room for fun, games, and hijinks. But, near the end of development, I had a homepage at the time and I was drawing caricatures on it just for fun and a TV company got in contact. There’s a program in Japan where they get people on and they compete by drawing caricatures and they’re judged and everything, and I got invited to go on that!</p>
<p>And I thought, 'Huh, okay!' It’s a pretty famous program in Japan, so I thought I’d ask Nintendo and they said, “Yeah, go ahead, why not!” Nintendo said okay, but I was planning to go on without making a big deal about the fact I worked for Nintendo. Then I heard the date the program was going to go live, and it was the release date for Majora’s Mask in Japan!</p>
<p>So I thought, 'Well, in that case, I’ll go on and say who I was!' Then the program ended up coming down to the studio and filmed us developing the game a little bit, and there was me at my desk drawing some pictures. It was such a happy coincidence.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b88936f5a41cc"><a title="Tingle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b88936f5a41cc/tingle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you know if that is available online to watch?</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t been able to find it actually.</p>
<p><strong>Oh really?! I would personally do so much to see that!</strong></p>
<p>The program was called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Champion">TV Champion</a></strong>. *<em>picks up phone and starts looking*</em> It’s a knockout competition and I made it through to the final!</p>
<p>By the way, are you a fan of Tingle?</p>
<p><strong>*shrugs and shakes head*</strong></p>
<p>[Laughs] I know there was a fan campaign to get rid of Tingle at one point, much like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars!</p>
<p><strong>I was quite young when the game came out, I think I played it when I was eight. I remember wanting to be Link when I was a kid, so when I saw Tingle, I was like, “Oooo, who is this guy?” He doesn’t fit in the suit, flying around on balloons, letting out a funny scream when you shoot him down. I’ve grown to love him now, but as a kid I always wanted to be the 'cool guy.'</strong></p>

<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161283/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stray Children launched on the Japanese eShop on 26th December 2024. We weren't able to review it back in October when it arrived in the West, but we've now managed to catch up with Onion Games' latest...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Your dad’s missing and some weird “uncle” is at the door, claiming to know you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stray_children">Stray Children</a> just chucks you straight into things with barely a title screen – but perhaps that sort of stylistic confidence is unsurprising coming from people behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/moon">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>. Yoshihiro Kimura and Onion Games have delivered a compact, auteur-driven project, heading off on adventures into emotional storytelling rather than into sophisticated mechanics. And it uncovers some impressive treasures on its quest.</p>
<p>The story we’re told is that of a dog-faced kid venturing into a fantasy world through the screen of a video game. That world is surreal, funny, and sometimes very dark. In contrast to this unsettling tone, the graphics present charming, cute pixels, with a colour palette stirring memories of the Game Boy Advance. That soft presentation is the lens to show rather strange and uncomfortable things: <strong>Lord of the Flies</strong> orphans in a prison, for example, or a stalking frog paparazzo.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161282/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game takes its unexplained opening and runs with it, shunning straightforward exposition and trading instead on feelings and vague impressions. Nonetheless, the gist of it is that you are trapped in a trippy, sinister world populated by children who are abandoned and lost.</p>
<p>It is the world of a video game, and its heroic knight has been destroyed – your task is to put it back together. The children, meanwhile, are lacking clear figures of authority, yet subject to judgement, labelled “bad” and punished. You explore from a top-down perspective in the 16-bit style, talking to myriad inhabitants of this endlessly off-kilter world.</p>
<p>The themes of parental authority and a child’s perspective are taken further by the enemies in the lands you explore. You will face random encounters with the “Olders” – creatures based on adults, themselves failing to cope with hang-ups and demons. They inflict suffering and strict expectations while wrestling their own internal frustrations.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161284/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In practice, this is represented by bullet-hell-style attacks dealt out in a turn-based structure. Kimura was reportedly inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>, which is no bad thing. The Olders can be defeated by attacking on your turn, which requires you to stop a spinning arrow on a segment of a circle. The size of the segment, its position, and the number of rotations you’re allowed before you have to press all get changed up. However, it’s not exactly the deepest mechanic – that’s just not what the game’s going for.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting, the Olders can instead be talked down from their fixations and freed, excluding them from further random encounters. This talking mechanic is a continuation of the inscrutable approach Onion Games has taken to the game. Various speech options need to be selected in the right order during combat, taking one turn per option, and resetting when mistakes are made.</p>
<p>Finding out the right order for your statements, however, is mysterious in the extreme. It’s very easy to miss out completely on freeing the Olders, and even the ones you get will still require some guesswork. Later, tougher bosses make trial and error pretty severe, too.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161280/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That experience of talking to the Olders is emblematic of the game’s general attitude to you as you play. There is plenty of friction here, but it’s so consistent from minute one that it’s clearly intentional. Experiencing the world as something confusing and unexplained — inexplicable perhaps — is alienating but childlike. This hammers home what the game’s about, but it doesn’t always feel good to engage with. There’s a tension between delivering on the theme and being fun to play, but that just makes the game interesting.</p>
<p>One thing that consistently delights, however, is the sound. The music sits perfectly with the game’s surreal world and its colours, which seem at once washed out and oversaturated. Eerie woodwinds, for example, make the perfect theme tune for tailing pigs along a train track, something like 2000s J-pop accompanies a lily pad gliding minigame, and a trilling harpsichord leads you around a grand palace.</p>
<p>The stand-out feature of the sound effects, meanwhile, has to be the character voices. These sit somewhere between the apparent sentences of Simlish and the one-dimensional jibber-jabber of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a>. They are clearly somehow composed from different languages, with some distinctly German snowmen being particularly memorable.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161277/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite some frustrating repetition (unskippable dialogue right between a save point and a boss fight? Check!), Stray Children is not overlong, clocking in at about 12-15 hours. A lot of my time was spent wandering, searching for hidden items in every nook and cranny, and talking to every character I saw – sometimes a requirement for progression.</p>
<p>Again, though, the game gets away with the friction: the disorientation and lack of comfort create a sense of vulnerability – of being a stray. No doubt some players will find this opacity all a bit much. But for those feeling patient and intrigued by the art style and storytelling, it’s a joyful thing to play overall.</p>
<p>While I was in the latter camp — loving the surreal world despite the challenges — I was definitely grateful for the pick-up-and-play nature of the Switch. The pixel art looks great on the small screen, too. The hybrid console is still the best way to play the right kind of games, and this is one of them.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stray Children is nothing if not opinionated. From its abrupt opening to its inscrutable mechanics, it outright refuses to hold your hand. This clarity of purpose builds a world that is totally captivating – <em>if</em> it gets its hooks into you.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the time and patience to explore and experiment while being labelled a “bad child”, this may not be for you. However, if you’re game for some surreal challenges, this is a memorable and ultimately optimistic adventure.</p></section>

<p>I suspect many of my fellow parents can relate to this, but when you have your first child, a whole bevvy of problems that never existed before are suddenly thrust upon you.</p>
<p><em>“Do we have enough nappies?”<br></em><em>“Oh God, she missed the potty again.”<br></em><em>“No, you can’t sit there Daddy, my Peppa Pig toy is sitting there.”</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="MjdXHwRDqMw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytMjdXHwRDqMw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3948b1jhsxlk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Granted, a lot of these aren’t necessarily ‘problems’ as such, rather minor inconveniences that, along with frequent moments of unbridled joy, make up the weird and wonderful world of parenthood. I do, however, have a bit of a bone to pick with Nintendo, specifically with its approach to game difficulty in the last mainline Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Before having a child, the idea of lowering a game’s difficulty had honestly never really entered my mind. If anything, I would crank the difficulty up wherever I could in the hope that it would both extend my overall playtime and provide a unique sense of accomplishment. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/halo">Halo</a> on Legendary? No problem. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> on Climax? Is that all you've got?</p>
<p>This all changed, however, when my daughter expressed interest in playing Mario Wonder. She watched the <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and became somewhat obsessed with the characters – especially Princess Peach. She’s only three, so I knew immediately that if I’m going to let her play, I’d need to make sure it was as approachable as possible, despite my own proclivities.</p>
<p>As you might know, however, Super Mario Bros. Wonder essentially locks its lower difficulty setting to specific characters: Nabbit and four Yoshis. So when the character select screen came up, I gently tried to explain this to my daughter, knowing full well how the conversation would go.</p>
<p><em>“Now listen, if you go for one of <strong>these</strong> characters, the game will be a bit easier for you and you’ll have a lot more fun.”<br></em><em>“I want to be Princess Peach thoooough!”<br></em><em>“That might be a bit trickier. If you go for the purple rabbit, it’ll be better.”<br></em><em>“No, Princess Peach!”</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="d3b1fe9bd18f7"><a title="SSMBW - Nabbit 02" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3b1fe9bd18f7/ssmbw-nabbit-02.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"You'll play as Nabbit and you'll LIKE IT!"</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Sigh.</em> Anyone who’s had the pleasure of raising a three-year-old knows that it’s borderline impossible to change their mind once their heart is set on something. In this case, Princess Peach is my daughter’s favourite character from the movie, so <em>of course</em> she’s going to want to play as her. This meant we'd have to do without the perks – including <em>invincibility</em> – that come with Yoshi or Nabbit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how did it go? Well, rather predictably, not well. The opening stage – Welcome to the Flower Kingdom – was doable, but it went rapidly downhill from there. I knew that changing to Yoshi or Nabbit wasn’t suddenly going to make the game a cakewalk; after all, while both characters boast unique abilities that would theoretically make most scenarios easier, there’s still the task of actually navigating the levels. Given my daughter’s age and inexperience, even that would no doubt prove quite the challenge.</p>
<p>Still, it seems baffling to me that Nintendo would create a game aimed at children and families and not offer any optional difficulty settings for the majority of its 12 playable characters. No offence to Nabbit, but no child wants to play him when the likes of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach are sitting right there; especially when the Illumination movie had such an immediate, profound influence on my daughter's perception and preferences.</p>
<p>And yes, I know Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options, in my eyes.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I managed to convince her so she could enjoy the game, but she was exceptionally stubborn in her desire to play as Peach. And honestly? I'm quite proud of that. It makes me think that perhaps, way off in the future, she'll be playing her games on higher difficulties just like me... Or she just loves Peach and wants to play as her – yeah, that's probably it. In the end, though, she gave up and went back to playing with her Peach plushie.</p>
<figure data-uuid="585a5d013f786"><a title="SMBW - Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/585a5d013f786/smbw-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yeah... She never got this far.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> have proven that even the most challenging of experiences can be accessible to almost anybody when it has the right options in place. Quite frankly, I think with invincibility turned on and unlimited stamina applied, my daughter could probably have more fun with Celeste than she did with Mario Wonder – and I consider the latter to be <em>much</em> easier on its default settings.</p>
<p>So come on, sort it out, Nintendo. You've made some strides with difficulty and accessibility options over the years, but you've clearly got a long way to go. Applying blanket difficulty settings to a tentpole Mario title seems like the most basic of tasks when your goal is to reach as many potential players as possible, but as ever, the company stubbornly does things its own way.</p>
<p>Forcing those who want a breezier time to play as a specific character, though..? Nah, that ain't it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work]]></content:encoded>

<h3>"a lot of stick" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Greedy Nintendo! Time and again we hear it, Nintendo are greedy! It is a line that gets repeated so often, I wonder if people actually consider what it means. Shareholders? Nintendo's dividend payments place them just behind Microsoft, as well as many other companies in the gaming sector like Koei Tecmo, Square Enix and Capcom. Executives? In 2024 Shuntaro Furukawa was paid just over a fifth of what Phil Spencer earns at Microsoft. But Nintendo charge too much, especially for older games! Maybe that is true, but they pay their staff quite well and have really high retention rates, they also seem to reinvest what they earn from their popular titles in more niche titles, so maybe the latest release of Super Mario Galaxy will pay fro a new Famicom Detective Club, Another Code or Advance Wars. I also don't think that Gameshare is a feature that screams greed. Nintendo are getting a lot of stick at the moment, and they do make some wrong headed decisions at times, but as far as massive corporations go, they seem ok. We've all gotten used to low prices in gaming, but low prices, high development costs and a fandom that is often reluctant to compromise on quality, is not a recipe for a sustainable industry.<br>
<strong><em>Andrew Mcleod</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't disagree that Nintendo, <em>generally</em>, seems to focus on the right things when it comes to experimenting with new ideas, respecting employees, and doing things that other companies wouldn't or couldn't do. That's why we're all here.</p>
<p>It would be great if everything were cheaper, but again, <em>generally</em> Nintendo does a decent job of threading the needle on pricing - although a $50 Kirby amiibo feels like a real ask. Welcome Tour should absolutely have been a pack-in, too, so I get the frustration, especially in this economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, I don't think the company needs us defending it from a little childish name-calling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sweaty"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there Nintendo Life!<br>
I wanted to shout out a franchise that I think doesn't get enough credit: Just Dance. I feel like Just Dance is often seen as just that one yearly Ubisoft release that nobody bats an eye at. But this year reestablished for me what a powerhouse it is for social and energetic fun.</p>
<p>This feeling came to me at Comic Con. There was a huge Just Dance setup and it was constantly packed with people. Joining these crowds for the first time was an experience. There's nothing quite like being in cosplay, standing in a crowd of other con-goers and cosplayers, and jumping around to Boney M.'s Rasputin or teaming up with a stranger for Lady Gaga's Abracadabra. No other game there generated the kind of loud and mass fun that Just Dance did, and that's an achievement.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Its appeal is nearly universal. I've enjoyed the game with all kinds of people and in all kinds of places, including in gamer spaces. There's this lovely gaming space I frequent, stacked with consoles and games, so we can play just about anything we want there. Yet a bit ago I booted up Just Dance, and it was a smash hit. We had a blast waving our arms and stepping around the room, with wide grins and loud cries of energetic joy. (Also, shoutout to the accessibility filter and accessible dance routines, so people that can't stand or jump could also join in.)</p>
<p>And speaking of moving around, that's another thing I have to praise Just Dance for. I don't exercise nearly enough: I find it very hard to push myself to do so and I feel deeply uncomfortable and unsafe at gyms. But Just Dance is fun, motivating and accessible enough for me to get up and move with it at least every couple of days. With Just Dance+ there's more than enough songs to keep things fresh, and trying to learn the difficult expert routines to songs like Dua Lipa's Houdini or Britney Spears's Circus and Toxic is genuinely a really fun challenge. I'm not going to act like it's a substitute for proper exercise, but it's a heck of a lot better than nothing and I guarantee you that some of these routines will get you sweaty. You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying, I'd love to see it.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Just Dance is a high quality game with lovely visuals, fun and varied choreo's, and appeal everyone including many hardcore gamers. I know it's not for everyone, nothing is, but in so many groups it's been a guaranteed good time for many years, and it deserves more credit for that. Love you Just Dance!<br>
<strong>Zander</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, it suffers from being the known-est of quantities in 2025, but Just Dance is decent and I've had fun with it over the years.</p>
<p>Honestly<em>,</em> "<em>You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying</em>" is prime bonus letter material, Zander. But we're staunch Boney M defenders in this household, and I wouldn't be able to embed this video in the bonus section. Wunderbar. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"throw my hat"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With all this talk about animal crossing I've seen a lot of debates about whether new leaf or new horizons is the best. I'd figured I would throw my hat in the ring. I grew up playing new leaf so I have a very strong emotional attachment to that game. I think neither is better than the other. When I play new horizons there are things I wish it had that new leaf, and when I play new leaf there are things I wish it had that new horizons had. For those at the NL towers who have played both what do y'all think?<br>
<strong>beltmenot</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wild World was my first, so the impact of anything afterwards is lessened - in my brain, WW is still peak. New Leaf and New Horizons are pretty much on a par. For all the improvements, NH has gotten unwieldy with items accessible in too many different places for my taste, and more to come in the January update. And I'd give anything for an icon that shows if you already own an item on sale in Nook's Cranny!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/poll-so-animal-crossing-new-leaf-or-new-horizons-which-do-you-like-best">We have discussed this before</a>, and most of the team are off on their hols now, but let me see who I can find ransacking the office fridge for party leftovers... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"NL is way better. Too much crafting in NH, it felt like a chore – NL was honed to near perfection." - <em>Ollie</em></li>
<li>"NL - <em>love</em> NH, but the fiddly island customisation, the more homogenous villager personalities, and the huge focus on decorating gets away from what I adored in NL. NL felt a lot more compact and impactful to me." <em>- Alana</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>"nothing substantial"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendo Life,<br>
been a while since I joined Your community.<br>
last time i wrote a fan letter i was a kid and wrote to power and games, an italian vg magazine, asking for SFII advice on how to beat m. bison at hard level.<br>
no reply.<br>
I'm 43 and I am writing to you now with nothing substantial to say except for congrats on your hard work.<br>
greetings from Genova, Italy.<br>
<strong>Skoffo</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Skoffo! Greetings to you from the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>I'll get back to you with the Bison tips. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"in lieu"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a Splatoon fan, and I know there are others hiding around here somewhere, so in lieu of any news whatsoever at all about Splatoon Raiders or an 11.0.0 update for Splatoon 3, I am here with a list of tiny paint-based games to suggest. Or rather, a tiny list of tiny games, because this genre is not huge, apparently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ink">INK</a> - This is legit my favorite platformer! It's got a such a fun gimmick, good difficulty, and is super satisfying to speedrun! I have nothing more to say, just go buy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a> - This is essentially a Mario Party minigame, yes, but it's super fun! If you've got kids, or nieces, or nephews, or other little ones in your life, this is a good time! (Plus it's being updated regularly, so if you ever have suggestions... send 'em in to Hey! Kookaburra and he'll probably implement them.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> - It's on NSO, and like... 67% of you probably have this, so give it a whirl!</p>
<p>OK, thank you for reading my tiny list of tiny games with ink-based aspects. Have a nice day, and stay fresh!<strong><br>
CaleBoi25</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't have NSO, I know a man who's got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">a few copies of Mario Paint</a>. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"There could be a Pokémon game collection with Gen 1, 2 and 3 with remakes included." - <strong>Your fan, Scottdevine48</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine how much greedy Nintendo would charge for that? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hello NintendoLife,<br>
Could you please publish PSA articles about NSO game trials? Not everyone is always online and they are easy to miss." - <strong><em>Morsel</em></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a rolling guide might be best. I'll see what we can do. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I got an NSO N64 controller and realised that it can be used to play Mario Kart 8. Do you know what other non-Nintendo Classics games it works with?" - <strong>OswaldTheLuckyGamer</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything that doesn't require a second stick? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I just want to say, I love nearly all of you." - <strong>Ed.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sus. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Feature: I Play This One Particular SNES Game Every Xmas As A Personal Tradition]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-play-this-one-particular-snes-game-every-xmas-as-a-personal-tradition</link>
            <guid>1392067</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It was the Christmas of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/svcznf9cxtY?si=XFI81dUw7IU_LgNC">Mr Blobby</a> was the funniest thing on television (according to your parents), and <a href="https://youtu.be/3JWTaaS7LdU?si=X88fExf5WKFM4q0D">Whitney Houston</a> had been tricked into singing a love song about everyone's favourite sentient cardigan, Kevin Costner (I feel like I'm having a war flashback now).</p>
<p>And me? Well, I was having a great time despite all of this, actually. Because Santa had done me a massive solid.</p>
<p>Now, two things. Firstly, Santa hadn't done a toilet in my lounge. That's not what I mean at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I was 14 years old in 1992, so I shouldn't have been asking my bewildered and frightened parents (Mr Blobby-loving fools) to send a rather bullish letter to the North Pole requesting — demanding — a Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<p>With the arrival of this tour-de-force into to the sitting room of my Dickensian home on 25th December 1992, I, for the first time ever, was experiencing graphical and gameplay parity (<a href="https://youtu.be/BiufDI8cBkU?si=8WK4Z9utZUC-3ee2">after a lot of trying on my beloved Commodore 64</a>) with the local arcade version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">The World Warrior</a>, where I had previously been spending all the money I could steal from my Mr Blobby-loving dad to feed my addiction to Eddie Honda's big shiny chest. (Don't worry, I never paid him back.)</p>

<p>This was my first Nintendo console! My first console of any kind that was mine, in fact, and as a result of this, and because it was the first game that really made me feel as though the home experience could indeed match the flashy side of the arcade one, Street Fighter 2 has — and always will have — a very special place in my heart. It was a bonus, really, that it was also phenomenal to play as well as to sit and stare at.</p>
<p>In a way that it's hard to convey today, when we're drowning in deep and meaningful gaming experiences, and when gamers have grown up with home consoles that give them the best of everything at their fingertips, Street Fighter 2 awakened me to the possibility that, for me, gaming might not, like a puppy for example, be just for Christmas.</p>
<p>And this is the serious bit, the 'science bit' if you will. Because I grew up in a time and place that happened entirely before the internet (and possibly before Jesus, but that's another Christmas story for another Christmastime), it was very easy to feel cut off and left behind in matters technologic. Such was life in rural '80s and '90s Ireland; lots of cow s**t, not so much of the latest high street cool s**t.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3cc5bfd3621c5"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3cc5bfd3621c5/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Street Fighter 2, though, with those fancy arcade-perfect graphics and noises and music, well, that was what everyone who knew anything was playing and talking about that particular year's end (in my young mind), and I was now playing and talking about it, too. Mostly to myself, but you can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>It seems like nothing, and it is! But that little glimmer of feeling as though I was involved was, for a wee guy who was yet to meet any other real-world gaming pals, and for someone who lived quite remotely, it was a big deal to be riding the latest wave of excitement. You couldn't just hit someone up in their DMs back then, y'know. Connections hit different.</p>
<p>And so, because I'm a legit saddo (as you'll now know and understand), every Christmas <em>to this very day</em> I still boot up the old Street Fighter 2 on my SNES (not my OG machine, unfortunately) and dig into one or two runs of its fabulous arcade mode. It's a game that's never aged in my mind; it looks as good as it ever did in its detailed pugilists, atmospheric environments and delightful little background animations. And complaints about the awful frame rate will get you banned from my Xmas party punch bowl, I'm afraid.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fcb98f3984af0"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fcb98f3984af0/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It ties a bow on my festive period, it drowns me in just right volume of intoxicating nostalgia, and it reminds me of more innocent times. All of that guff.</p>
<p>But it also marks a point where I remember vividly having shifted from loving games and playing games for what they were to wanting to keep them in my life as a thing that helped me connect and feel connected. And I guess that's what I'm still doing to this day.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to show my sons how red and trembly my face goes when I can't reliably pull off Vega's wall dive. Merry Christmas and that.</p>

Perhaps you're reading this with a Switch-related treat sitting under a nearby tree, or maybe you're all set already and are looking forward to a chilled day with a game or two. Sounds good!</p>
<p>Whatever your circumstances as the new year approaches, all of us here at Nintendo Life are with you in spirit and wish you the Merriest of Christmases and the Happiest of Holidays. We'll leave you lovely people with a British Christmas classic. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>
