<p>Announced earlier this year, 22nd July marks the second <strong>Pokémon Presents</strong> of 2025. While you're all jamming along to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsskPQsZRaE&amp;ab_channel=TheOfficialPok%C3%A9monYouTubechannel">DJ-ing Pikachu</a> out there, what do we think we're going to see today?</p>
<p>The stream kicks off at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 12am AET (Wednesday)</strong> and looks to be roughly around 25 minutes.</p>
<p>We're sure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is going to show up, and the usual slate of mobile updates will be coming, but we hope to hear more about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, and perhaps that pair of Pokémon GameCube games on Nintendo Switch 2's NSO service.</p>
<p>Well, no matter what's on the horizon, trainers can gather here and talk about everything we're about to see. We'll be bringing all of the news to you, so we might not be around for the chatter here. But still, grab a snack, some drinks, and your favourite plush — it's time to see what's in store for the franchise going forward.</p>

<p>Blames Star Wars for poor performance thus far...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot, has been answering questions during a recent general meeting about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has struggled thus far to live up to expectations, with rather poor sales figures overall.</p>
<p>Now, ask this writer and he'll tell you that Star Wars Outlaws is a genuinely cracking game, really and truly, and we're all very excited for its Switch 2 release here at Nintendo Life. Indeed, it's likely to prove the console's first 'impossible port' of sorts, especially if it manages to arrive in a decent state, so interest is high in this one, for sure, even for non-SW fans.</p>
<p>With regards to the game's current sales issues, and as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-blames-star-wars-outlaws-missed-sales-targets-on-star-wars-itself-being-in-choppy-waters-but-hopes-further-improvements-and-a-switch-2-launch-can-revive-the-open-world-game/">GamesRadar</a>, Guillemot says that he sees Star Wars itself as part of the problem, with fans perhaps feeling done in with constant TV shows which, in 2024 when the game was released, had sort of run out of steam a little. Yes, we didn't like The Acolyte either, Yves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game suffered from a number of items. First, it suffered from the fact that it was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters, said Guillemot, whilst also acknowledging that the game wasn't quite perfect at any rate, "The game had a few items that still needed to be polished...they were polished and debugged in the early weeks after release, but it did affect sales volumes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily for Switch 2 fans, then, it also seems that the version we'll get our hands on come September 4th will arrive with some added improvements, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We did heavily improve the game by troubleshooting and debugging. When it will be released on upcoming consoles such as the Switch 2 it will have a new version of the game. Improvements on the game are not finished."</p>

<p>Now, that's what I call a backlog</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="clair obscur actor Mario 64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb2cd6f669cba/clair-obscur-actor-mario-64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sandfall Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is one of those games that, even though it isn't available on any Nintendo consoles - well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-seems-open-to-a-switch-2-port">not yet anyway</a> - we've all likely heard plenty about it thanks to just how widely-acclaimed it's been since launch earlier in the year. And rightly so!</p>
<p>Indeed, this very writer gave the dazzling RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-seems-open-to-a-switch-2-port">a rather nice 10/10</a> over on our sister site Pure Xbox, so yeah, it's a proper all-timer. And therefore, it may come as something of a surprise to learn that Charlie Cox, who plays Gustave in Sandfall Interactive's epic, reckons he hasn't played a video game since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>...which is ages ago.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-charlie-cox-vows-to-finally-play-the-game-his-first-since-super-mario-64">as reported by Eurogamer</a>, Cox, who spent just four hours recording his lines for the game, and says he feels like a "fraud" as a result, has been chatting during a Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon over in New Orleans, as you can see from the following clip from the chat that's been shared on social media.</p>

<p>The British actor, who was most widely known for his roles in Daredevil and Stardust before his newfound Clair Obscur fame, said that <em>"I remember being in the studio and thinking, 'this is beautiful, the visuals are extraordinary...They've come a long way since Mario 64, which is probably the last computer game I played."</em></p>
<p>Now he's promising to pick up an actual console and play the game that's thrust him into the spotlight as a bonafide video game star, <em>"I wanna play the game,"</em> he remarked, <em>"I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game."</em></p>
<p>Maybe, once he's eased back into the pastime with some of his own game, he'll be ready to return to the likes of Mario, who, we think it's fair to say, has changed a little bit since the last time Mr Cox had a blast.</p>
