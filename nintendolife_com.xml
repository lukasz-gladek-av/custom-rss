<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/2026116124568641634">post on social media</a>, the team has revealed how "significant updates" for both the Switch 2 and Switch release have led to this delay. It doesn't go into any further details about this, but a new release date for Juliet's zombie-slaying adventure on Nintendo's latest hybrid platform will be announced when the team has completed its preparations.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8zilrgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the developer's notice in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Notice of Release Postponement]</p>
<p>LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP Nintendo Switch 2 Edition had been scheduled for release on March 26, 2026. However, due to the need for significant updates not only to the Nintendo Switch 2 version but also to the currently released Nintendo Switch version, we have made the difficult decision to postpone the release.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all fans who have been eagerly awaiting this title. We will announce the new release date as soon as preparations are complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Dragami's previous update in January, the "Upgrade Pack" for this title (at least in Japan) is set to be a paid release.</p>
<p>When the Switch 2 version does eventually arrive, it will apparently include graphical enhancements, as well as improvements to the performance. Joy-Con 2 mouse support has also been announced and will be featured in an exclusive arcade-style mode, where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret.</p>

<p>Following a surprise announcement at the end of last week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> from the Game Boy Advance generation are making a grand return on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of conversation online about the Switch eShop versions, which are priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each. Some trainers are ready for battle, but others are still questioning why Nintendo didn't make these classics available via the Switch Online service (or give fans both options).</p>
<p>Despite all this back-and-forth, it seems both titles are already making bank on the Switch eShop. Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-preloads-are-now-live">preorders going live last week</a>, we've now taken a look at the eShop, and at the time of writing, these GBA titles have already topped the Switch charts in the US, UK, Japan and Australia. <em>So, there's definitely some interest!</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fokzysq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As you may have already guessed, Pokémon FireRed (repping the Fire/Flying type Charizard) is leading the charge, with Pokémon LeafGreen in second place.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed these Switch versions of the games will contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">the same content as the original releases</a>, and you can expect some modern solutions for the connectivity features. Support for <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a></strong> has also been confirmed, and these titles can be played while using the GameChat feature.</p>
<p>Although these releases might be easy money for Nintendo, this doesn't necessarily guarantee we can expect to see other first-party retro titles on the eShop. According to an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">official FAQ</a>, this is a special case marking Pokémon's 30th anniversary, and there are seemingly no plans to revive "Virtual Console types of offerings".</p>
<p>Nintendo says it intends to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-seemingly-rules-out-virtual-console-revival-says-it-remains-focused-on-offering-classics-via-switch-online">remain focused on offering retro releases</a> for its Switch Online subscription service going forward.</p>

<p>April is the new March</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The noir-style cartoon detective FPS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a> was scheduled to arrive on Switch 2 next month, but it seems there's been a slight delay.</p>
<p>Instead of its 19th March 2026 release, this title will launch for Nintendo's new hybrid system (and other platforms) on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>. In a new <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/2026046752693092801">notice on social media</a>, Fumi Games &amp; PlaySide Studios says it wants to deliver the best game possible and just needs a few more weeks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As we approach the final stages of development, we want to ensure we are taking the extra time and care needed to make Mouse: P.I. for Hire an experience to remember. We remain unwavering in our goal to deliver you the best game we can, and that will take just an extra few weeks."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The same update mentions how the team is excited to share "more of the game" with followers in the lead-up to the release, so expect more updates soon! This isn't actually the first time Mouse: P.I. for Hire has been delayed. It also follows the announcement of the Switch 2 version in October last year.</p>
<p>You can find out a little more about this game in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/vintage-shooter-mouse-p-i-for-hire-blasts-onto-switch-2-in-march-2026">our previous story here on Nintendo Life</a> and an official developer "deep dive" documentary below. When it arrives, players can apparently expect "fast-paced FPS combat" and a thrilling single-player campaign with over 20 levels.</p>

<p>With this in mind, today it's added an absolute banger - it's the soundtrack for the 1992 Game Boy title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2 - 6 Golden Coins</a> starring Mario (and Wario). This album features tracks like "Mario Land" and "Star Course". It offers <strong>35 tracks</strong> and has a total runtime of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This soundtrack was composed by the one and only Kazumi Totaka, who is known for his famous song <a href="https://youtu.be/_cfBw8cnWgg">"Totaka's Song", which appears as an easter egg</a> in many Nintendo games. He has also voiced Nintendo characters such as Yoshi.</p>

<p>It's a more "challenging production process"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="675381b58be4e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/675381b58be4e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> to the Switch 2 in June 2026.</p>
<p>Compared to the first entry, part two is a significantly larger game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">small but intricately detailed open-world zones</a>. Despite this, the target goal apparently remains the same, according to the trilogy's director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/we-ask-final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-naoki-hamaguchi-about-the-switch-2-versions-hair-problem-why-does-it-happen-and-can-it-be-avoided/">Automaton</a> recently, he mentioned how the team's engineers are targeting 30fps "wherever possible". This will apply to not only Rebirth, but also the third installment in the trilogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> "We’re consistently aiming for 30fps wherever possible. For FFVII Rebirth and the third installment of the trilogy, our engineers are working hard on tuning to ensure stable performance at that level. I hope players will look forward to it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamaguchi adds how the team is working hard to optimise the game so it can maintain a "stable frame rate", while also improving the visual quality "as much as possible" at the same time.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a0b673b84fe83"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0b673b84fe83/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows some comments Hamaguchi made not long ago, when he acknowledged how the second game was a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">much more "challenging production process"</a> overall but was still confident his team of engineers would be "able to deliver".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has also confirmed both titles to follow the Remake will feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">"exactly the same" gameplay experience</a> as other platforms.</p>
<p>When Rebirth arrived on the PlayStation 5 in 2024, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> thought it was a "great" sequel, but did call out the "disappointing" performance mode on this platform at the time, which <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/03/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-getting-another-patch-to-improve-performance-mode">led to a post-launch update</a>. As for our time with Remake on Switch 2, we thought it was an excellent experience, even at 30fps and with "a few minor dips" in handheld.</p>
