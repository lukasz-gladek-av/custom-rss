<p>Fire Emblem is the first release of 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> was originally teased for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack's GameCube library last year, and it's now been added to the service in the first update of 2026.</p>
<p>This tactical role-playing game was originally released on the GameCube in 2005. We'll have a review up soon on Nintendo Life, so you'll be able to find out more about it soon. For now, here's some backstory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>All of Tellius is torn in a bloody war that has set the human empires against the nations of the shape-shifting laguz. A small band of mercenaries, led by the earnest but inexperienced Ike, possesses the means to end this war, but a hard path lies before them. Players must master strategy, steel and sorcery to restore order to the seven kingdoms."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As a bonus, Nintendo has also released the game's soundtrack on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>. You can check out the trailer for Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance in the video above.</p>
