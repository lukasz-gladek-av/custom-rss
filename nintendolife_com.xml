<figure data-uuid="fba9872ff7aaf"><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fba9872ff7aaf/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who witnessed its initial release, I’m delightfully baffled that Nintendo is resurrecting the Virtual Boy. We aren't just getting a passing mention or a trophy in a <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> game; we’re getting a full-blown revival, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">a dedicated NSO app</a>, a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">$100 authentic replica peripheral</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">$25 cardboard cutout</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo</a> diehards.</p>
<p>All this for the console that married Game Boy visuals with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/tags/vectrex">Vectrex</a>-style wireframes, stuffed them into a View-Master shell, and doused the whole package in a colour palette straight out of a 19th-century darkroom.</p>
<p>Yeah, <em>that</em> Virtual Boy.</p>
<p>For 30 years, Nintendo’s first rule of Virtual Boy was "You do not talk about Virtual Boy," yet here we are in 2026, and Nintendo is embracing the most eccentric chapter in their storied history. I’m dumbfounded, but honestly, I’m here for it.</p>
<h2><strong>1995: Rose-Coloured Glasses</strong></h2>
<p>For most, the Virtual Boy is more meme than memory - particularly for European gamers who missed it entirely. When it launched, I was a video game columnist for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County_Journal">Journal-American</a>, right in the heart of Nintendo of America's backyard: the Seattle Eastside. My journalistic credentials earned me an early look at the Virtual Boy, plus day one copies of the console and all four launch titles.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5cc0157273dc1"><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cc0157273dc1/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My August 18, 1995 article covered the launch, and I was surprisingly optimistic, as evidenced by my headline “Nintendo’s 3-D gaming system first step in the right direction”. I saw potential in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/marios_tennis">Mario’s Tennis</a> and the wireframe wonder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>, and I even theorised that if games kept coming out, the Virtual Boy would become as much of a household name as the Game Boy.</p>
<p>I was half right. It became a household name alright, just not for the reasons Nintendo’s marketing team had hoped.</p>
<h2><strong>A Silly Seven Months</strong></h2>
<p>By any measure, the Virtual Boy had a rough life. With only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?system=virtualboy&amp;sort=title">22 games worldwide</a> and fewer than 800,000 units sold, its owners belonged to one of the most exclusive clubs in gaming history.</p>
<p>The VB’s sales were so poor that in 1996, a little more than a year post-launch, my younger brother won an award at Sears for selling a single system. By that point, moving <em>one</em> unit was the retail equivalent of selling dirt to a desert dweller.</p>
<p>Frustration was palpable even within Nintendo’s inner circles. I remember visiting the offices of Golin/Harris, Nintendo’s marketing consultants, and hearing them complain that major magazines like Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) couldn’t be bothered to review Virtual Boy games.</p>
<p>EGM ignored it, but Nintendo’s Tripod made an appearance in my other writing gig at the time, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-2-1_Contact#Magazine">3-2-1 Contact</a> magazine. My colleague, Rusel, wrote reviews for the entire Virtual Boy launch lineup, while I had the more enviable task of reviewing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> on the SNES. I must’ve drawn the long straw that month.</p>

<h2><strong>The Trade I Won, and then Lost</strong></h2>
<p>The Virtual Boy came and went quickly, but I wound up with a complete set of Nintendo-published VB games. Apparently, Golin/Harris and the Big N were eager to partner with any journalist willing to peer into the red abyss.</p>
<p>Roughly a decade later, I traded my dusty VB collection for a sweet haul of SNES RPGs, including both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire">Breath of Fire</a><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire_ii">s</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/lufia_and_the_fortress_of_doom">Lufia 1</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/lufia_ii_rise_of_the_sinistrals">2</a>, and every Square Enix RPG I didn’t already own.</p>
<p>I felt great about the trade at the time, but looking at prices now, yeah, I probably lost out in the long run. I undoubtedly won in the gameplay department, but with complete-in-box Virtual Boys selling for almost $1000, I clearly missed an investment opportunity.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7033ec41895fe"><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7033ec41895fe/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Some old E3 press kits (which I sadly no longer have) with pages on unreleased VB games <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_High!">Bound High</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Hopper">Dragon Hopper</a></strong> — <em><span></span> Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>2026: Nintendo Owns the Meme</strong></h2>
<p>My personal journey with the VB concluded decades ago, but Nintendo seemed to exile their red spectacles for even longer. So, why the sudden comeback? And why now? I have two theories - one practical, and one cheeky.</p>
<p>First, it’s hard not to see this as a nod to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/3ds-virtual-boy-emulation-gives-you-3d-without-the-headaches">last year’s release of Red Viper</a>, the impressive fan-made Virtual Boy emulator for Nintendo 3DS. After the homebrew community showcased an appetite for VB emulation, Nintendo may have taken the old proverb to heart: the best time to plant a tree (or re-release a tripod-mounted console) was 20 years ago; the second-best time is today (or February 17th 2026).</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:152750 @ 1768065483 -->
<p>My second theory may be cheeky, but is perhaps more likely. This revival could simply be corporate self-deprecation. Nintendo is finally cool enough to celebrate a misstep failure while simultaneously revelling in the Switch’s success. It reminds me of <a href="https://ew.com/catwoman-halle-berry-razzies-speech-exclusive-8680946">Halle Berry personally accepting her Razzie</a> for <strong>Catwoman</strong>, holding an Oscar in one hand and the Razzie in the other, proudly declaring that if you can't be a good loser, you don't deserve to be a good winner.</p>

<h2><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h2>
<p>Whatever the reason, the 30-year era of Nintendo pretending the Virtual Boy didn't exist is officially over. Nintendo is actively marketing a library of games that the 1995 media complex avoided reviewing, and I’m not sure what to believe anymore.</p>
<p>If the Virtual Boy can rise from the grave in 2026, then seemingly nothing is off the table. Who knows? Perhaps an official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother 3</a> translation or a Zelda CDi All-Stars collection is right around the corner. At this point, nothing would surprise me.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Fire Emblem: Path Of Radiance (GameCube) - Aged & Easier Than You're Used To, But Still A Winner]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gamecube/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance</link>
            <guid>1402420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161433/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Did you know that the Japanese version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> has a 'Maniac' difficulty mode? You did? And did you know that this mode sort of fixes my biggest problem with the game? You did? Can I do the review anyway? Thanks.</p>
<p>Jumping back into Path of Radiance, the first home console FE, for the first time since all the way back at Christmas 2005 (I got <strong>Goblet of Fire</strong> underwear, thanks for asking), my one complaint from 20 years ago remains an issue: it's all a little bit too easy, most especially if you're a big fan who's been hoovering up the newer stuff and becoming a strategy master in the meantime. Veterans may find even the toughest of the three available difficulty options — appropriately titled 'Difficult' — too sedate for their tastes.</p>
<p>But let's park that one specific point for a moment, because as important as it may be, it doesn't manage to derail what's still a fantastic slice of vintage <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/fire_emblem">Fire Emblem</a> goodness. Path of Radiance tells one of the series' strongest stories, you see. In fact, it's a story so strong (no spoilers ahead, I promise) that, regardless of how the combat may have aged over two decades, no matter how much sharper, more detailed and intricate the newer games are, this one still delivers a lot to love.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161431/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Path of Radiance is one of two FE games (the 'Tellius Duology' if you're down with the lingo) set on the continent of Tellius, with the other being its immediate follow-up on Wii, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/fire_emblem_radiant_dawn">Radiant Dawn</a>. So, upon locking into this one, you're all set for a doubleheader of epic proportions to disappear into. Which, let's face it, is exactly what everyone could be doing with right about now. *points at now*</p>
<p>Taking control of Ike, a member of the Greil Mercenaries, your job in Tellius as you join the action is to defend the borders of Crimea, a region of humans, against attacks and incursions from neighbouring Gallia, which is full of monsters. Because of course it is. Before long, things go quite spectacularly south, with the Crimean capital falling to invaders, and Ike and company spiralling into an arduous journey of revenge and justice-seeking. That's where we come in.</p>
<p>I won't detail anything further in terms of the story but it's fairly clear that, as the first Fire Emblem to feature voice acting (and 3D character models, maps, and battle locations) they went all-in, and as a result we get a banging narrative to jump into alongside battles that, whilst absolutely a little slow and cumbersome looking back from further down the series line, still provide the goods that series stalwarts thirst for.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161438/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>This is, after all, an entry that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-fire-emblem-games-of-all-time?page=2">consistently ranks highly in best-of lists</a>, and once you dig in, regardless of all the time that's passed, you'll find it sinks its hooks in fast. It's one of those timeless, classic numbers you hear old people (me) banging on about. Furthermore, and it's an important detail in the grand scheme of things, once you've played through this wondrous thing, you're all set up, fully locked and loaded, to dive into Radiant Dawn, which is another cracker, though one which is unfortunately exclusive to Wii at the time of writing.</p>
<p>So, you've got a great story here (one that will likely lead you into playing the next part), it still looks and plays really nicely, and the combat? Even when a Fire Emblem game has got a little long in the tooth, that core turn-based strategy goodness sings.</p>
<p>The face-offs here stick to the series formula of a rock-paper-scissors weapons triangle at the heart of the action. So, axes over lances, swords over axes, lances over swords - you know the score. Path of Radiance then adds slick 3D battle sequences to the action. Okay, so they were slicker back in 2005, but luckily you can turn off these extended animations for clashes, making for quicker fights all around. Indeed, once you've switched these off, it's hard to tell the game is really that old at all, given how great the text menu avatars and scenery all look. Even the rumble support is on point.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161435/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Path of Radiance also brings Luguz enemies to the table - transforming, lycanthropic foes who will shape-shift throughout battles into other forms such as birds or even dragons. It makes for encounters which feel elevated from the run-of-the-mill stuff of the time. They still feel strategically whip-smart, and are then further enhanced by a cool Bonus XP system that rewards efficiency (in turn pushing you to up your game and engage with all of your options) and, of course, permadeath. Oh, sweet permadeath, how you infuse everything with a touch more excitement and meaning. And tears.</p>
<p>And, really, excitement and meaning (and tears) are what you're getting. Over the course of 40ish hours, this one still has the power to razzle-dazzle with its magical melding of strategy and a story that adds drama where it needs it, whilst also introducing a plethora of entertaining friends and foes.</p>
<p>It might not be the latest or greatest Fire Emblem, then, but Path of Radiance is certainly well up there, and now that we've got it so easily to hand via NSO on Switch 2, it's really hard to criticise its gentle ageing all that harshly. Get over the fact it's not quite as feature-complete as your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_engage">Engages</a> or your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Three Houses</a>, and you'll soon find yourself all wrapped up in an adventure that's sucked me in all over again.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161429/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Now. Where can I find a copy of Radiant Dawn that isn't more expensive than a holiday?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance still has the power to pleasantly surprise, bringing strategically satisfying battles in the signature series style, alongside a story that packs in plenty of fun characters and big moments across its running time. Yes, it's aged a bit, the 3D battle cutaways (which you can switch off) are a bit naff two decades on, and it's not as swish as the newer entries, but that's all to be expected.</p>
<p>Look past a little dust and time-weathered rough edges, and there's a wonderful time to be had here that leads you right into an equally excellent sequel.</p></section>

<p>Geralt might be returning sooner than you think</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9801de76cdc07"><a title="Witcher 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9801de76cdc07/witcher-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure><p>There are currently <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/03/cd-projekt-group-presentation-fy-2024.pdf">multiple Witcher projects in development</a> and it seems one of them might be new content for Geralt's third outing.</p>
<p>Over the past week, a rumour about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> getting a "surprise" DLC expansion popped up online after Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski mentioned how he was expecting a "paid add-on" for the game to be released as early as March 2026.</p>
<p>This was reportedly backed up by a Polish leaker known as 'Borys Nieśpielak', who claimed Fool's Theory (the Polish development team behind the upcoming remake of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2022/10/the-witcher-remake-announced-rebuilt-in-unreal-engine-5">first Witcher game</a>) was involved in this new content (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-3-is-reportedly-getting-a-surprise-new-expansion-this-year/">via VGC</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="U0vFWbkMXWk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytU0vFWbkMXWk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402be5jzgkoq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, in another development, <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw">IGN Poland has added fuel to the fire</a>, claiming it first heard about a new expansion for Witcher 3 years ago, but didn't publish anything as it was unable to corroborate this information. Here's what the Polish website was apparently told at the time, according to PC Gamer. Keep in mind there has been no official confirmation about a new expansion or what content it might include.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could successfully undergo the Trial of the Grasses"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other factor supposedly fueling this rumour is the news CD Projekt needs to generate around $277 million by the end of 2026 to achieve an "incentive program target". It's a goal one investor believes would be "extremely" tough without any new content this year (with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/witcher_4">Witcher 4</a> not expected to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/">release anytime soon</a>), so a DLC for the existing title could definitely help the company reach its target.</p>
<p>Chrzanowski also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">told Eurogamer</a> that CD Projekt Red was still short of its goal, with just "five quarters remaining", which "implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform".</p>
<p>We'll try not to get too ahead of ourselves here, but If this expansion is the real deal, it would no doubt be the prime opportunity for CD Projekt Red to consider a Switch 2 Edition of The Witcher 3. And it's already proven what it's capable of on Nintendo's new hybrid system with its excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> port.</p>

Luckily, we've got games to keep us busy, and we're going to go through which of the buggers we plan on playing this weekend.</p>
<p>In case you've missed the main headlines this week, let's take a peek at what's been going on in the world of Nintendo. First up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-with-another-game">released on the GameCube NSO app</a> for the Switch 2, so that's lovely. Fans of green and purple will also be pleased to know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">new Joy-Con colours</a> are being released in just a few short days.</p>
<p>We got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer-serves-up-a-host-of-fresh-features">new overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which is looking really solid so far, while more 'evidence' emerged to suggest that <strong>Call of Duty</strong> might <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-call-of-dutys-nintendo-release-is-apparently-on-target-for-2026">finally make its way to Nintendo platforms</a> this year.</p>
<p>And now, let's see what Team NL is up to this weekend, hm?</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a more-of-the-same week for me, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/expelled">Expelled</a> still occupying the left side of my Switch 2 home screen. The GameCube NSO app is there now, too, thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Path of Radiance</a> dropping, and I also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a> the other morning with my coffee.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'll be valiantly resisting the eShop sale. Gotta love that post-holidays quarterly tax bill. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I love Star Wars, but it's a franchise I really have to be in the mood for. As such, I often take lengthy breaks before diving back in. The good thing about this is that there's often a boatload of new content to enjoy when I do eventually sidle back into the fandom. With that in mind, I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_jedi_survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, both on the PS5.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is getting a bit of love, though. I'm currently making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and it really is quite remarkable. Ubisoft nailed it with this one; it's just so darn fun with a wonderful sense of place.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't remember the last time that my weekend gaming plans were dominated by free demos, but here we are! I haven’t had a chance to touch either <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>’s tasters yet, and I’m super excited to dive in. I’m not so excited by the prospect of falling madly in love with both of them and ending up with two meaty RPGs on my plate to start the year, but that’s the risky game I play.</p>
<p>Oh yes, I was also lucky enough to finally get Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 over the holidays, so I have been busy tinkering around with all of the side quests I intentionally left untouched once I heard it was coming to the hybrid. May the Force be with you, dear readers!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Being a Portuguese myself it never gets old listening to Portuguese NPCs speaking fluent Portuguese in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Really, they’re a bit everywhere in the game, I hope it all works out for them in the end (historical spoilers: It does not). I am not sure in exactly what percentage of the main story I have already completed, but there will surely be many hours spend this weekend in virtual 16th century Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> left me wanting more trooper based action so after a four year hiatus I have reinstalled <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on STEAM and resumed my single player campaign marathon where I had left it (two thirds into Halo 2). Having just completed (and loved) Halo 3 ODST, I am moving on to Halo 4.</p>
<p>Game of the week is actually a demo: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is just a very cosy JRPG that ticks all my boxes. I hope to compete said demo before the real villain shows up: Monday!</p>

<p>Fans of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> can apparently look forward to "free major updates" this month and next. There are no specific release dates just yet, but here's a rough translation (via RPG Site):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akihiro Hino:</strong> "This is the video published internally in Level-5 on the last working day of 2025. It was done in a rather interesting way, so I'm sharing it with everyone too. Once again, please support us in 2026 as well. Both Inazuma Eleven and Fantasy Life i will have free major updates in January and February. We'll also do an Inadai [stream] on January 13. Look forward to it!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rmzilq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

            <guid>1402279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="db4a5556cf705"><a title="Beast of Reincarnation" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db4a5556cf705/beast-of-reincarnation.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon developer Game Freak recently released the DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, so what's it up to beyond this? In case you missed it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/game-freaks-upcoming-action-rpg-looks-awesome-but-dont-expect-it-on-switch-2-yet">when it was revealed last year</a>, the studio has a new action RPG <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/beast_of_reincarnation"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong></a> in the pipeline.</p>
<p>In an update this week, it's now been revealed we'll be hearing more about it at Xbox's upcoming <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/xbox-developer-direct-2026-showcase-gets-official-date-alongside-three-confirmed-games">Developer Direct showcase</a>, taking place later this month on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. This latest broadcast from Xbox promises to give fans an "inside look at not just the games" but also "the studios working to bring them to life".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>We’ll also be taking a trip to Tokyo to visit the legendary Game Freak, offering a first in-depth look at</em> <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em><em>, which we revealed at Xbox Games Showcase last year."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while there may not necessarily be any Nintendo-related announcements here, we might at least get a look at the inner workings of Game Freak and how it goes about developing new projects.</p>
<p>For now, Beast of Reincarnation will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC and Game Pass. It was officially revealed in June 2025 (just days after the launch of the Switch 2) and is published by Fictions and directed by Kota Furushima - a Game Freak employee who has <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kota_Furushima">worked on the battle system and sound</a> in past Pokémon releases.</p>
<p>Beasts of Reincarnation is described as "an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat". Here's a slightly more detailed description and the trailer from last June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion. Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Game Freak has mostly focused on major Pokémon projects over the years, in between these releases, it has worked on its own unique titles. During the Switch generation, it released games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_town_hero">Little Town Hero</a> across multiple platforms and even revived <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pocket_card_jockey_ride_on">Pocket Card Jockey</a>.</p>
<p>As for its latest Pokémon DLC Mega Dimension, it's not bad, but like the base game it lacks the freedom of the core series.</p>
