<figure><a title="Yakuza 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45f84f9f16719/yakuza-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report from Chris Dring's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=4150086&amp;post_id=166316380&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=357pt4&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">The Game Business</a> highlights a few sales stats for launch games on the recently-released Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the article, "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers" at launch, with the vast majority of players understandably gravitating towards <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. As per data from NielsenIQ, 86% of physical Switch 2 game sales were first-party, including the MK World bundle. If we exclude the bundle, the result would be 48%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the US, Circana states that 68% of sales were for first-party, excluding the bundle. By comparison, launch sales for the Switch 1 were 89% first-party in the UK and 81% in the US. So yes, while these numbers have dropped, it's important to note that there are far more physical Switch 2 launch games than there were Switch 1 launch games.</p>
<p>The best-selling third-party game was, as most would probably expect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>. Meanwhile, Sega is the third biggest third-party publisher for the Switch 2 with launch titles including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a>.</p>
<p>However, one unnamed publisher described initial sales as "below our lowest estimates", despite remarkably strong hardware sales.</p>
<p>It's thought that there could be a few potential reasons behind this. The first is that, as mentioned earlier, most people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games, first and foremost. The second is that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, with many Switch 1 titles performing better on the new hardware, thus eliminating the immediate need to buy more new games.</p>
<p>The third is that most third-party games are indeed ports of older games that a lot of folks may have already played. Fourth, the vast majority of third-party titles are Game-Key Cards, which passionate fans have been against from the word go. This may have also contributed to Cyberpunk's higher sales, which notably includes the full game on the cartridge.</p>
<p>And finally, Nintendo's decision to hold back review units of the Switch 2 until the very last moment meant that consumers had no way to gauge just how viable the third-party games would be. Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination</a>, for example: a strong game to showcase the Switch 2 on paper, sure, but one that falls short with some pretty dismal frame rate issues.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on how sales shake out over the coming months, but with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> coming out this year from Nintendo, we suspect third-parties may continue to feel the sting for a little while longer.</p>

<p>That really is updating the world</p>

The game has sold over 1 million copies across all platforms, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 version in particular is absolutely fantastic</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the developer has <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">shared more details</a> about that upcoming free DLC, <strong>Update the World</strong>, and it really is updating the world, as Ginormosia will be transforming into a base for a roguelike, open world adventure (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-update-the-world-to-add-new-mode-roguelike-open-world">Gematsu</a>!). A date hasn't been announced, but Level-5 is aiming to bring it to fans "as soon as possible."</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179jymxiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Alongside this massive-sounding mode, more powerful gear, new equipment, new mounts, some strange new items, and additional emotes and hairstyles will be coming. But, most importantly, look at this fuzzy new character who will play an important role in the DLC. Is he good? Is he bad? We don't care — he's got a very fluffy mane!</p>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time DLC Character" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eae014d763176/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-dlc-character.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Level-5 promises that, for as big as the world sounds, the upcoming DLC will offer "engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." Well, the base game already does that, so Level-5 will be stealing more of our time in the near future.</p>
<p>We're delighted to see how successful and popular Fantasy Life i has become, and the Switch and Switch 2 versions are now totally up to date with other consoles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-scores-another-switch-1-and-2-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">as of today's free update</a>. Between this and Mario Kart World, we're never going to have time for anything else, are we?</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to this free DLC in the comments</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition-a-fantastic-little-upgrade.1223019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I absolutely adored the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fantasy_life">Fantasy Life</a> on the 3DS, and thankfully, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has proven to be a worthy successor, sinking its claws into me all over again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Kate Gray reviewed the Switch 1 version</a> and said, “It's beautiful, it's robust, it's got multiplayer, it's got three fully-fleshed-out areas to explore, it's got crafting and foraging and cooking and fishing and minigames and beautiful music and sidequests and more. And it's all really, really good.”</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182726 @ 1750344520 -->
<p>Well said, Kate, and I wholeheartedly agree. It's one of those wonderfully addictive games where there's so much to do, so much to see, and all the numbers go up and up making you feel really good about your progress. You could argue that it does little to meaningfully evolve the gameplay from the 3DS original, but when it's this good, I'm really not that fussed.</p>
<p>So it’s great news, then, that the Switch 2 version makes the overall experience even more enjoyable thanks to a small batch of noteworthy improvements to the presentation. We’re mainly talking about resolution and frame rate here, so don’t expect any fancy mouse controls or HD Rumble 2 or tie-ins to a mobile app.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i admittedly looked pretty nice and performed reasonably well on Switch 1 at around 30fps. That said, the significant bump up to 60fps on Switch 2 is very welcome and I can’t imagine going back now. It doesn’t <em>always</em> hit its target, particularly in the larger open-world environments, but I didn't get anything more serious than a few minor dips here and there.</p>
<p>Similarly, the visuals are much crisper than before, especially noticeable when playing in handheld mode. The blur effect is still in place around the edges of the screen, but it feels slightly toned down to allow the game’s world to shine brighter than ever. You can turn this off completely, if you wish, but I find the focus blur adds to the charm; kinda like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link’s Awakening</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>
<p>A small patch applied shortly after release also boosts shadow quality and the object render distance; a minor improvement, but one that further widens the gap between the versions. Load times were acceptable on Switch 1, averaging between 5 and 10 seconds, but this has been cut down significantly to 3 or 4 seconds for most scenarios.</p>
<p>Given how cheap the upgrade is for Switch 1 owners — you’re looking at £2.04 / $2.59 / €2.27 or your regional equivalent — the performance improvements for Fantasy Life i on Switch 2 are more than worth the price of admission. Other publishers have the gall to charge full price again (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">looking at you, Sega</a>), but this is an acceptable middle ground. If you’re keen on trying out Level-5’s long-awaited sequel, this is absolutely the best way to play on Nintendo systems.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
