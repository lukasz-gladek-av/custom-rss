<figure><a title="mig bans" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b279277ed479/mig-bans.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we reported <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-reportedly-banning-switch-2s-using-mig-cartridges">last week</a>, Nintendo has been banning <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles from using online services if it finds them to be using MiG carts, effectively 'bricking' the new consoles by denying them any online access whatsoever.</p>
<p>Nintendo has seemingly decided to come down tough on this issue for its new generation of system, with social media and internet forums slowly coming alive with users who've been faced with an “Error Code: 2124-4508” message. However, a potential knock-on effect is that the secondhand market for Switch 2 consoles may be becoming a bit of a dodgy death run for those seeking a cheaper option on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/used-nintendo-switch-2-bricked-3569050/">Android Authority</a>, at least one potential Switch 2 owner has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1lew6m5/found_one_didnt_end_well">shown up online</a> to report that their console, bought at a discount, was actually 'bricked' with the same error code message. Not ideal.</p>

<p>Piracy has been a scourge for Nintendo, particularly over the past few years with some high-profile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/watch-out-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-leaks-are-out-in-the-wild">pre-release leaks</a>. With carts such as the MiG providing a route to play ripped, pirated copies of games, it's perhaps inevitable that potential buyers are going to have to be extra careful going forward.</p>
<p>In the case above, where the console was bought at a Walmart, it was an easy case of returning the console for a refund without an issue. Start getting these problems with tech bought on the likes of eBay, Gumtree, or other sites, though, and forking out for a secondhand Switch 2 could end up being quite the sweat-inducing prospect.</p>
<p>Will potential Switch 2 owners need to work out some way of having proof provided by private sellers? If the online banning continues as it appears it has done in these early days, we'll be hearing more about this problem as a mountain of bricked hardware begins to pile up.</p>
<p>For stores, too, how do they verify that a console isn't 'bricked' before they accept a return? There's a lot of potential verification time to be spent on an extra layer of checks on returned goods.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be sure to keep you updated.</p>

<figure><a title="Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ad1f1337a4f7/masahiro-sakurai-on-creating-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qPqBilhEtI">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434">a Yahoo Japan interview</a> (geo-locked) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> lead and game dev extraordinaire Masahiro Sakurai has blown up in the West, with reports suggesting that the Kirby creator is advocating for generative AI. However, it seems the nuance of his comments have gotten a little lost in translation.</p>
<p>Translated quotes shared on social media suggested Sakurai saw AI as a solution to the issues facing developers of large-scale games, although prominent posters such as <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1936888173327433860">Stealth</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1936935928666501290">Genki</a> have since removed initial posts as more nuanced interpretations of his interview comments have been proposed.</p><p><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In the interview, when asked about the future of the games industry, Sakurai said he doesn't believe the current development model is sustainable due to the amount of time and work involved in producing the biggest games.</p>
<p>He followed this with comments on generative AI which were initially taken as endorsement, although as pointed out by others online, the tone is one of disappointment about the realities of AAA game dev and uncertainty about its future, not 'AI is the solution'. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">Jenny on Bluesky</a> sums it up like this:</p>
<figure><a title="jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬ Bluesky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9aaecc75c6c63/jenny-atmiinipah-subahibi-net-bluesky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For comparison and context around the blow-up, here's Google's stab at machine-translating the relevant section of the interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>While game development is becoming larger and more specialized and fragmented, the indie game market, which is made by one person or a small group of people, is also growing. What do you think about the future of the game market?</strong><br>
To be honest, it's impossible to tell what's going to happen in a moment. I think that if you try to make a large-scale game like the current one, it's too much work and it's not sustainable. I feel that we can't continue like this, but at the moment, the only effective solution I can think of is generative AI. I feel that we've reached a stage where we have to change the scheme, such as by using generative AI to improve work efficiency. And I think that we will enter an era where only companies that can respond well to this change will survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it looks like another example of machine-translated text not quite capturing the nuance of the comments or the context of the conversation. Given Sakurai's extensive dev experience (which he's channelled into his enormous and excellent video series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a>), having him suddenly extolling the virtues of AI-authored content would be something of a turn.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that he was just commenting on AI as a solution being proposed by some at a time when AAA game development is more costly and time-consuming than ever.</p>
<p>Sakurai is currently working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for Switch 2, the sequel to the GameCube racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, which is currently set to launch in '2025'.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Nintendo Racers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7725d4c79231/mario-kart-world-nintendo-racers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's no denying that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> packs a pretty impressive roster of racers (come on, 50 characters, <em>plus</em> costumes ain't bad), but we'd be foolish if we didn't pour one out for the familiar faces that were lost along the way. We're talking, of course, about the <del>Koopalings</del> wider Nintendo characters that got cosy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, but missed out on the starting line this time around.</p>
<p>Link, Isabelle, the Villagers and the Inklings no longer grace the character select screen in World, and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">Ouest-France</a>, producer Kosuke Yabuki explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>According to Yabuki-san, the Mario Kart World development team felt the line-up was already beefy enough, <em>without</em> Link and co. in tow. "As developers, it would have seemed incongruous to us to add characters from other games into this universe," he told the French outlet (via Google Translate), "And it didn't seem necessary to us, given everything we could already do with Mario".</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/this-is-it-nintendo-on-why-it-added-cow-into-mario-kart-world">Ask the Developer interview</a> gave us some insight into how excited the developers were to add the likes of Cow to the game, so it makes sense that the team would want to keep going with as many Mario regulars as possible. We'd be on that character select screen all day if they started adding lil guys from <em>every</em> Nintendo franchise, after all.</p>
<p>And, let's admit it, we've all gone crazy for some of these newbies, regardless of where they came from. "The reception has been so warm that it surprised even us," Yabuki-san told Ouest-France, "It definitely exceeded our expectations".</p>
<p>"We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this casting," Yabuki-san concluded, "But there are so many characters and so many costumes that every player is sure to find something to suit them".</p>
<p>Part of us assumed that Mario Kart would balloon into some sort of Smash-style 'Nintendo Kart' for the next entry, so it's actually pretty refreshing to see the Big N go in the opposite direction. And besides, who's choosing Link over Monty Mole?</p>
