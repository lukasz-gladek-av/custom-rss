<p>There was plenty of juicy news this week, as we saw <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/balatro">Balatro</a> arrive in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/balatros-back-to-steal-all-your-spare-time-in-new-switch-2-version">all-new Switch 2 version</a> (RIP our spare time), Nintendo continued to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/donkey-kong-bananza-has-been-updated-to-version-3-2-0">waves of updates</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/poll-whats-your-favourite-3ds-model">3DS turned 15</a>, and that's not to mention everything we heard in the annual <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-february-2026-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Pokémon Day Presents</a> showcase.</p>
<p>It was reviews that stole the show this time, however, as we shared our thoughts on a bunch of Resident Evils — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Village Gold Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Biohazard Gold Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">9/10</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">9/10</a>) — as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/caves-of-qud">8/10</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">The Disney Afternoon Collection</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-disney-afternoon-collection">8/10</a>).</p>
<p>Now then, what's everyone up to this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:198088,198072 @ 1772280127 -->
<h2>Alex Olney, Senior Video Producer</h2>
<p>As much as I'd like to say I'm planning on playing Resident Evil Requiem this weekend, I can't make that claim. That's because I've already completed it like the cheeky boy that I am. Instead, I'll be dipping my toes into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across The Unknown</a>, and probably spending 50% of that time allocated to Janeway's adventures in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> because I have a problem.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Apologies for the last two weeks of silence, haven’t had much time for video games due to “adulting”, but I'll make it up this week because not only is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Arcade Archives 2 Rave Racer</a> on the grid, but something else I have been quite looking forward to: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/raiden_fighters_remix_collection">Raiden Fighters Remix Collection</a>! Time to dust off my arcade stick. Oh, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron">FUR Squadron</a> sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron_phoenix">FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>, has been released without much fanfare and is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_fox_64">Star Fox 64</a> in all but name. Do a barrel roll… ish! Rounding it all off is a major update on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> that brings the new Tech Marine class to the table. Bless the Omnissiah and whatnot... but where is the Switch 2 port?</p>
<p>My game of the week is Resident Evil Requiem. It has been a very long time since I played a Resi game on release day (I believe <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a> 2019 remake was the last), and seeing the latest RE Engine entry in the series running this well on Switch 2 gives me great hope for future Capcom support on the system.</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>After playing the ever-so-lovely <strong>Resi</strong> games for the review on Monday, I think my nerves need a wee break with some cosy games. I've been playing even more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> (I'm obsessed now) and some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cast_n_chill">Cast n Chill</a>. I still intend on jumping back onto Resi 7 &amp; Village as I really enjoyed both of them. I'm determined to have nerves of steel by the end of the year!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still on my classic Pokémon kick with all the 'mon news in recent weeks and have been enjoying training up my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Emerald</a> squad after getting sufficiently <em>whooped</em> by Tate and Liza in Mossdeep's Psychic Gym. It really takes me back to the good old days, and I'm doing everything in my power to resist dropping 20 quid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed</a> this weekend to do it all over again on Switch.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This week is the Steam Next Fest, and though I usually abhor playing a demo (I'm too hungry to eat just a snack), I have been playing tons of demos on stream this week to entertain my friends! It's been a mixed bag, for sure, but some real gems in there, too. I'm going to be keeping an eye out for any of them coming to Switch, so I can say "aha! I knew it was good ages ago. I am very cool" and everyone will nod and respect me for my deep wisdoms. That's the plan, anyway.</p>

<p>Capcom has done it again</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has done a great job with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but if you're still debating about it and the PlayStation 5 release, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://youtu.be/8izgK3xQHWY">shared a side-by-side comparison</a> of the game running on the Switch 2 and the PS5 Pro, and as you can see, the wizards behind other Switch 2 ports such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> have done it again!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/dlss-is-the-game-changer-for-resident-evil-requiems-impressive-switch-2-port?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Digital Foundry</a> mentioned in its own technical analysis, the Switch 2 is running a low internal resolution in docked but this version and the PS5 release actually end up comparing "fairly equivocally", and it's all thanks to DLSS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Foundry:</strong> On paper, a 540p image blown up to 1080p on a modern flat panel display doesn't sound great. However, DLSS looks surprisingly competitive. Fine detail like wires and fences can actually appear more temporally stable on Switch 2, while PS5's spatial upscaling solution (likely FSR1 or similar) looks noisier and less refined in motion. PS5 still wins overall on clarity, aided by its higher internal resolution and 4K UI (Switch 2 uses a 1080p UI), but the gap is much narrower than raw pixel counts would suggest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of cutbacks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-analysis-of-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-capcom-deserves-kudos-for-this-port">as previously noted</a>, geometry is pared back in the Switch 2 version and there are lower-quality textures. Capcom has also taken a "different" approach to the character hair design on Nintendo's new hardware, but overall it's a solid effort.</p>

<p>Game Freak is moving on from the original Switch hardware</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="8367be104bdbb"><a title="Pokémon Winds And Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8367be104bdbb/pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 generation last year, certain first-party titles have received cross-platform releases. Trainers saw this with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but this won't be the case for the new mainline entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, The Pokémon Company has clearly stated in official press materials and the new webpage how these next-generation entries developed by Game Freak are "exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2". In other words, Nintendo's existing hybrid platform isn't part of the plans.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fixvuzo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a glance, this new generation is already looking quite promising, and Game Freak potentially has over a year to polish the experience, with the titles currently scheduled for a 2027 release.</p>
<p>So, this means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> and Legends: Z-A are likely the last "major" new entries that will be released on Nintendo's original Switch hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo previously said it would continue supporting the original Switch as long as there's an audience, but also understands "exclusive games are crucial when launching new hardware" and intends to shift support to its new hybrid system as the fan base grows.</p>

<p>Watch your language, trainers</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="27101ee173e6e"><a title="Pokémon FireRed Version" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27101ee173e6e/pokemon-firered-version.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the joys for many trainers during the earlier generations of Pokémon was giving the main character and their rival a rude or downright inappropriate name. In the Switch eShop versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a>, it seems there have been some updates to this.</p>
<p>As reported by Kotaku, you'll either have to get <em>really</em> creative now, or there's a good chance the game will override whatever you've input and instead give you a generic name. Here's a sample of some of the words that won't fly:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fixvuzo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Kotaku</em> has verified that some words, such as “d**k,” “p***y,” “s**t,” and even the f-slur are replaced by names like “Gary” or “Janne.” This doesn’t seem to extend to some milder words, however, as “hell” and “damn” were not replaced."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This update appears to impact Pokémon names as well. One theory suggests the update is to prevent users from flooding social media with screenshots and footage containing offensive language. It could also potentially be linked to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a>. Either way, some names wouldn't be the best look, as Pokémon is intended to be a friendly experience for all ages.</p>
<p>As many trainers have highlighted, this confirms these classic Game Boy Advance releases have actually been edited for this special release. There have also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-version-gives-you-the-mystic-ticket-and-aurora-ticket">some other updates...</a></p>
