<p>It's only two months away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Universal Pictures and Illumination have just dropped a brand new teaser for the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, which comes to cinemas across North America and Europe on 1st April 2026.</p>
<p>The Level Up teaser gives us another look at the mix of Mario worlds and inspirations, but there's a few more Galaxy nods in this trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-galaxy-movies-new-trailer-shares-a-first-look-at-yoshi">than the last</a>. Namely, you might notice Megaleg, an iconic boss from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Rosalina makes a brief appearance once again, while Bowser Jr. gets up to plenty of no good. Yoshi also gets plenty of time in the spotlight in the 19-second trailer, including the appearance of his trademark spotted eggs and that unique tongue of his.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is apparently going to get a commercial during this weekend's Super Bowl, so we'll probably be seeing more of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, and co. pretty soon. So keep an eye out for that.</p>

<p>Starting the Switch 2 Edition in style</p>

<figure data-uuid="f8804591966af"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8804591966af/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Team Cherry surprised us all with the shadow drop release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (at least, it would have been a surprise if its PEGI rating hadn't cropped up online before), and the studio snuck out a new update to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.5.12459 update isn't packed with game-changing additions, but it's always nice to see Team Cherry fine-tuning the experience. Alongside new screen resolution support for PC players, the patch also introduces "many under-the-hood improvements brought over from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> to the original game," Team Cherry said in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollowknightupgraded">blog post</a>. And yes, this update is available on both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared in an announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/526493182068785899">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Hollow Knight ver. 1.5.12459 (Released 5th Feb 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.<br>
- Game now pauses while in inventory menus.<br>
- Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)<br>
- Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.<br>
