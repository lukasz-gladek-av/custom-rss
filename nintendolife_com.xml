<figure><a title="switch 2 indie dev kits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/751a6dce7f060/switch-2-indie-dev-kits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we all know by now, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource#switch-2-overview-tldr">Switch 2</a> has been off to a rocket of a start in terms of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-has-already-overtaken-the-combined-lifetime-sales-of-the-entire-xbox-series-family-and-ps5-pro-in-japan">hardware sales</a>, however, with regards to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">its current games lineup</a> — and with a particular eye on its indie offerings — there's certainly been quite a bit of heavy-lifting done by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in these early days and weeks.</p>
<p>If you'd been expecting a few more Switch 2 indie offerings at this point, though, you aren't alone, and there's at least a reason for the relatively slow-going in these early days. Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/where-are-the-switch-2-indie-games">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, a bunch of indie devs have been explaining the pre-launch dev kit access situation, with some getting their hands on the necessary tech ages ago, whilst others are still waiting.</p>
<p>Tony Gowland, from Ant Workshop — the team behind the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/into_the_restless_ruins">Into the Restless Ruins</a> — says slow access to dev kits isn't a new thing, and that on Switch 2 Nintendo seems to be prioritising games that need the extra grunt. This tracks when we consider the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> (with Hello Games saying they'd been working on the Switch 2 port for a year when they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/no-mans-sky-is-landing-a-free-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-on-launch-day">announced the S2 version</a>), as it's a showy example of just how much better a game can be on the new console.</p>

<p>"In terms of dev kit availability, there has been a similar situation to the OG Switch, which was also like hen’s teeth for a good 6-7 months after launch" said Gowland, "The indie folks I know who have been successful in getting kits are working on games that are in need of the Switch 2’s extra oomph."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2</a>, which has gone down a treat on Switch 1 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">we gave it a big old 9/10</a>), is one game that <em>was</em> aiming for a Switch 2 launch, but according to its creator, Gareth Damien Martin, it wasn't possible. Chris Wright, founder and managing director of Fellow Traveller, publisher of Citizen Sleeper 2, stated that they still don't have dev kits but that this is fairly normal, even if it can be irksome for an indie dev's plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s understandable that dev kits are heavily restricted before a console launch and they usually remain restricted for a while afterwards … The Switch 2 has been very normal in this regard and we didn’t expect to have access to kits ahead of launch...We're really keen to use things like the mouse controls in particular...Games like Citizen Sleeper will benefit from having mouse controls on the console."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the likes of Citizen Sleeper 2 at least, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/11-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">as with a whole bunch of other games from the previous console</a>, there is good news in that the game, when booted up on Switch 2, has ended up running with super-smooth frame rates, but in terms of honing, adding to, or improving your game for a new console launch, the access to dev tools is still far from ideal.</p>
<p>Wright's message is clear, "What we would like to see in the short-term is communication and clarity to indies on what we can expect...We’re very keen to support the platform and knowing a timeline would allow us to plan for that.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, both Unity and Unreal, two of the leading game engines, have Switch 2 compatibility, so things should be easier once the ball gets rolling properly. GameMaker, the 2D-focused engine used to create <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, is also fully Switch 2 compatible. Although Russell Kay, GameMaker's senior product manager, had to deal with some tight security around the dev kits ("We had to have a locked room, things like that, and only certain people had access to the kit"), he also seems relaxed and confident about the coming year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wouldn't be too worried, because all Switch games effectively work on [Switch 2]...There's a large catalogue of games already coming to Switch 1. Nintendo have done probably the best thing that they can...This time next year, it won't be a worry at all for anybody."<em><br></em></p>

<p>Bricking it</p>

<figure><a title="mig bans" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b279277ed479/mig-bans.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we reported <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-reportedly-banning-switch-2s-using-mig-cartridges">last week</a>, Nintendo has been banning <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles from using online services if it finds them to be using MiG carts, effectively 'bricking' the new consoles by denying them any online access whatsoever.</p>
<p>Nintendo has seemingly decided to come down tough on this issue for its new generation of system, with social media and internet forums slowly coming alive with users who've been faced with an “Error Code: 2124-4508” message. However, a potential knock-on effect is that the secondhand market for Switch 2 consoles may be becoming a bit of a dodgy death run for those seeking a cheaper option on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/used-nintendo-switch-2-bricked-3569050/">Android Authority</a>, at least one potential Switch 2 owner has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1lew6m5/found_one_didnt_end_well">shown up online</a> to report that their console, bought at a discount, was actually 'bricked' with the same error code message. Not ideal.</p>

<p>Piracy has been a scourge for Nintendo, particularly over the past few years with some high-profile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/watch-out-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-leaks-are-out-in-the-wild">pre-release leaks</a>. With carts such as the MiG providing a route to play ripped, pirated copies of games, it's perhaps inevitable that potential buyers are going to have to be extra careful going forward.</p>
<p>In the case above, where the console was bought at a Walmart, it was an easy case of returning the console for a refund without an issue. Start getting these problems with tech bought on the likes of eBay, Gumtree, or other sites, though, and forking out for a secondhand Switch 2 could end up being quite the sweat-inducing prospect.</p>
<p>Will potential Switch 2 owners need to work out some way of having proof provided by private sellers? If the online banning continues as it appears it has done in these early days, we'll be hearing more about this problem as a mountain of bricked hardware begins to pile up.</p>
<p>For stores, too, how do they verify that a console isn't 'bricked' before they accept a return? There's a lot of potential verification time to be spent on an extra layer of checks on returned goods.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be sure to keep you updated.</p>
