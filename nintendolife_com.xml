<p>If you're wondering how development is tracking, the latest update is the Switch 2 title has just been rated by the classification board in Brazil.</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-now-been-rated-in-brazil/">Universo Nintendo (via My Nintendo News)</a>, with the outlet suggesting an update about this game could be coming very soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game here was rated "over 12 years old", despite Nintendo's request that it be classified as "over 10"."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> was rated 'T' for 'Teen' and contained fantasy violence along with in-game purchases.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, this follow-up is scheduled to arrive "this winter" although some official online pages currently list 'TBD'.</p>
<p>As previously revealed, this game will take place <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and is set to feature the classic 'Warriors' gameplay. Here's a bit extra about it from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>

The game features epic battles against hordes of enemies as it tells the untold story from Hyrule's distant past of the Imprisoning War that ultimately led to the events of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em><em>. Fans of the Legend of Zelda series and players of both</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda:</em> <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> can experience the thrill of battle and this canonical tale featuring Princess Zelda, King Rauru, and other familiar characters.
