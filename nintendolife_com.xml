<p>A 35-page appetiser</p>

<figure data-uuid="e815a0e39a52c"><a title="Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e815a0e39a52c/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo / Piggyback</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released a 35-page digital sample for its upcoming <strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong> book ahead of its official release on <strong>28th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The sample shows off some gorgeous concept art from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>. We get a glimpse at Samus' Phazon Suit, Dark Samus, Meta Ridley, Metroid Prime itself, and various enemies and environments from the trilogy.</p>
<p>Of course, the full book, created by Piggyback and retailing for <strong>£39.99 / $49.99 / C$69.99</strong>, contains a total of 212 pages, so this is merely an appetiser for the main course. It'll include an introduction from series producer Kensuke Tanabe, writing straight from Retro Studios to introduce each game, and a whole bunch of producer notes to give context to the visuals.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>If you want to check out the digital sample, head on over to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective-artbook-arrives-on-oct-28/">official Nintendo website</a> and click the relevant link – you won't miss it.</p>
<p>The art book's release comes ahead of two <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> amiibo on November 6th: 'Samus' and 'Samus &amp; Vi-O-La'. The third and final amiibo, 'Sylux', lands on 4th December alongside the game itself on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was announced over eight years ago (!) at E3 2017 before development was restarted from scratch in 2019. It was subsequently announced in 2024 with the subtitle 'Beyond' and its debut gameplay trailer.</p>

<p>It won't be updated "in time for the main game's release"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> got a Switch 2 demo a few weeks ago, and it's raised some concerns about the performance of the game on Nintendo's new hybrid platform, with players reporting all sorts of issues about the frame rate.</p>
<p>While the eShop showed the game operating at 30FPS, there were seemingly some frame rate hiccups. Fortunately, Atlus is aware, and it seems the experience will be improved in a "future patch" for the main game.</p>
<p>General producer Yoshihiro Komori acknowledged this during a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-have-absolutely-no-intention-of-neglecting-her-persona-3-reload-devs-on-femc-and-porting-to-switch-2">recent interview with Nintendo Life</a>, but also noted how it wouldn't be ready in time for the full game launch this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life:</strong> The demo that was recently released on the Switch 2 eShop shows the game running at 30FPS, but with some frame rate hiccups. Is the team hoping to have those problems worked out for the final release of the game?</p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> "We are currently taking steps to improve this. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game’s release but will be in future patches."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, these improvements won't happen overnight, but there will be an update for this in a future patch. Be on the lookout for our full review of this title later today. It also details the game's performance on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>And if you want to try out this demo for yourself, head on over to the Switch eShop and download it now. Save data will also carry over to the full version.</p>

<p>Ahead of the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> later this year, why not take a trip to the past with some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> jams?</p>
<p>This title originally made its debut on the Game Boy in 1991/92, and now the entire soundtrack is available to listen to on the Switch Online Nintendo Music app. As usual, you'll need to be an active subscriber if you want to listen to these songs on this app.</p>
<p>All up, there are a total of 19 tracks, with the entire album length apparently a 30-minute runtime.</p>

<p>This particular album joins existing Metroid titles on the Nintendo Music app service including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, and the original NES and Famicom Metroid albums.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sonic-team-takashi-iizuka-interview/">Polygon at the Brasil Game Show</a> recently, the series producer Takashi Iizuka mentioned how DLC could potentially stretch beyond a year. It all depends on how much attention the game is getting from fans and the feedback the team is receiving.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what he had to say, noting how Sonic Team is also open to requests - from characters to other in-game adjustments:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067glnkqm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People really like the game, which gives us the confidence to continue making more content...If enough people are coming in and playing it, there's conversations about the game. We have one year of DLC, we could do year two, we could do year three of DLC... Tell us what you want!.. These are the things we can do because it is an online game. We could add new gadgets, we could balance the game differently.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of things like new DLC, Sega has also today announced the next free character update for this title will be arriving this week on <strong>22nd October 2025</strong>. In case you missed it, it's Joker from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona</a> series, along with a new themed festival.</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is out now on the Switch and will arrive later this year on the Switch 2.</p>
