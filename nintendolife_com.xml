<p>Well, well, well</p>

<figure><a title="Lost in Cult Animal Well" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77fe1c1476def/lost-in-cult-animal-well.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Derek Yu / Lost In Cult</em></figcaption></figure><p>2024's hit puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_well">Animal Well</a> is getting a second physical edition, this time from Lost In Cult, and it's absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>After announcing an artbook earlier this year, Lost In Cult has lifted the lid on two lovely little physicals on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/toadsanime.lostincult.co.uk/post/3lv4lutgv3f2y">social media</a> — one standard edition, and one exclusive edition designed by <strong>UFO 50</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a> creator Derek Yu. Both versions cost <strong>£29.99</strong> and will be shipping in Q4 2025.</p>
<p>The physical version will come with all recent patches on the cartridge, including the brand new Switch 2 compatibility update.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4aGvRTLyifg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f17ajoywsr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGvRTLyifg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>We love the art for <em>both</em> versions, to be honest — the clay animal statues on the general release are adorable and creepy, while Derek Yu's artwork is charming and manages to capture the limited neon colourscape of the game.</p>
<p>This is the second physical release for Shared Memory's acclaimed game following <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/animal-well?srsltid=AfmBOop1jpU2PyPb2WWhCsw4kkSVya_J3Ij0rW6udD1NkJFrbsyRXAL6">Limited Run Games' release last year</a>. So, if you missed out on that one, well, this one looks a little more unique!</p>

<figure><a title="Pikachu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/90fb457680c71/pikachu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon Company has started rolling out a brand new app from competitive players, which will allow them to track events easily for the <strong>Pokémon Trading Card Game</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>, the mainline games, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Play! Pokémon Access</strong> is out now in parts of Europe and is coming to the US on 4th August (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1950220130535035189">Serebii</a>!) and allows fans to access news about events from the <a href="https://play.pokemon.com/en-us/">Play! Pokémon</a> website from their phone.</p>
<p>Not <em>only</em> that, but the app becomes a one-stop tracker for players who are taking part in these events. You can check into competitive events using a QR code, keep track of your record in-game, look for car images, and register your current TCG deck.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>You can also use it to search for events and earn badges in the app for competing.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the app from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/play-pok%C3%A9mon-access/id6738208583?platform=iphone">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokemon.play.access&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Play! Pokémon program brings Trainers of all skill levels together at their local Play! Pokémon Stores, where battles are fought, friendships are forged, prizes are won, and—most importantly—fun is had by all. Play! Pokémon Access makes it easier than ever for Trainers to stay connected.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a player, Professor, or parent, Play! Pokémon Access puts you on the path to discovering new events happening in your area. Plus, it provides tools to make starting your Pokémon journey a breeze—you can search for tournaments for the Pokémon video games, Pokémon Trading Card Game, and Pokémon GO."</p>

<p>Admittedly, we're a bit surprised this wasn't teased or announced during last week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Presents</a>, same with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">TCG Pocket</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week">expansion</a>; but hey, what do we know?</p>

<p>Launching as a Switch 2 exclusive in the West</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After revealing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/disgaea-7-complete-is-launching-exclusively-on-switch-2-in-the-west">Western Switch 2 exclusivity</a> last month, NIS America has today lifted the lid on the release date for the upcoming definitive edition: <strong>10th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This 'complete' package arrived in Japan last year on PS5, PS4 and Switch, but only Nintendo's latest will be treated to the Western release (albeit as a Game-Key Card if you opt for the physical version).</p>
<p>For those who have missed it up until now, Disgaea 7 Complete bundles up the 2023 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disgaea_7_vows_of_the_virtueless">Vows of the Virtueless</a> strategy RPG base game and all of its DLC packs, gameplay tweaks like a new Hell Mode, max stats and more, <em>and</em> new characters and storylines. You can see it all for yourself in the above release date trailer.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Vows of the Virtueless when it arrived on Switch 1 a couple of years ago, calling it "another enjoyable entry in the long-running series, offering up a more refined take on the famously in-depth gameplay systems" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/disgaea-7-vows-of-the-virtueless">our review</a>. The complete edition certainly seems like it'll be <em>the</em> way to play this one, and fortunately, we don't have too long to wait.</p>
