In fact, with another quarter under its belt, the OG hybrid is edging ever closer to the DS' lifetime sales.</p>
<p>At the latest count, the Switch 1 has sold <strong>153.10 million units</strong>, putting it within touching distance of the DS' <strong>154.02 million</strong> and the title of the best-selling Nintendo system of all time. It only managed 0.98 million sales in the last quarter (a 53.5% decrease on the same period last year), but there was always going to be a notable slowdown once Switch 2 hit the market.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067oznmuy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's how the sales break down across the three Switch models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Switch OLED - 520,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Switch Lite - 230,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Switch - 220,000</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While surpassing the DS would put the Switch on <em>Nintendo</em>'s podium of all-time sellers, it will still have some way to go if it is to ever overtake the PlayStation 2's 160+ million units sold — which, let's not forget, got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/as-switch-approaches-the-ps2s-lifetime-sales-sony-moves-the-goalposts">generous five million boost</a> from PlayStation's ex-CEO Jim Ryan last year.</p>
<p>The big 160 feels a long way off for the Switch 1 (Nintendo only forecasts an additional 4.5 million hardware sales for the system in FY 2026), but we'd be surprised if we're <em>not</em> looking at a new Nintendo gold medallist in the next one or two financial reports.</p>

<p>Now, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-reconfirms-release-windows-for-major-switch-2-games">last one of these</a> that we saw looked <em>super</em> stacked thanks to a bunch of Switch 2 launch titles falling in the quarter, and this one isn't quite as beefy.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00174cf7731d2/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest financial results are live, and the platform holder has confirmed Switch 2 hardware sales "exceeding 6 million units globally in the seven weeks after launch."</p>
<p>Switch 2 launched on 5th June and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">today's Q1 financial report</a> includes figures up to the end of that month. The stated figure of "more than 6 million" accounts for sales past that date, though, to approximately 24th July (seven weeks post-launch).</p>
<p>As of 30th June, Nintendo had sold 5.82 million Switch 2s (3.5 million <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">in the first four days</a>) along with 5.63 million copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, including the digital downloads included in the popular Mario Kart hardware bundle. Overall Switch 2 software sales totalled 8.67 million units.</p>
<p>For comparison, the original Switch managed to shift 0.98 million units in the same period, down from 2.1 million in the same quarter last year (-53.5%), bringing it to a lifetime total of 153.10 million units so far. Switch 1 software sales came in at 24.4 million, down from 30.64 million in Q1 last year (-20.4%).</p>
<p>Here's the regional breakdown for Switch 2 hardware sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan: 1.27 million</li>
<li>The Americas: 2.08 million</li>
<li>Europe: 1.34 million</li>
<li>Other: 1.13 million</li>
</ul>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33cb7f24bec8/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> launched to critical acclaim, but isn't included in today's results (it launched in July) — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you'd expect following a successful console launch, gross profit increased 21.4% year-on-year (to 185.1 billion yen), although the lower profit made on the newer hardware meant profit margins declined 29.5 points to 32.3%.</p>
<p>Nintendo's forecast to sell 15 million Switch 2 units this financial year remains unchanged from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">its May forecasts</a>. The company expects to sell 45 million software units in the same period.</p>
<p>The report states that demand for the new system is exceeding supply "in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers."</p>
<hr>
<p><em>tl;dr: Switch 2 sold like hotcakes, Mario Kart World has a crazy-good attach rate (as you'd expect), and Nintendo's new generation is off to a very solid, record-breaking start.</em></p>

<p>New listing says it's a "game on cart"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bd8dd6dd346c/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new wave of Game-Key Card titles have just been announced for the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">following Nintendo's Partner Showcase</a>. Although it seems this type of release won't be stopping any time soon, not every third-party title is necessarily taking this route.</p>
<p>According to a new listing, Digital Eclipse – which has made a name for itself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/atari-50-game-list-every-playable-game-in-the-anniversary-celebration-expanded-edition">reviving various retro game libraries</a> – will be offering the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> on a full game cartridge. This information was shared via the Canadian-based physical game seller and website, Video Games Plus.</p>
<p>The social page makes a special note about how the Nintendo Switch 2 release is on the card. The website also lists a deluxe edition of this physical release for $114.99 CAD, which will apparently contain a "steelbook and other exclusive items" that haven't been revealed just yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Video Games Plus: "Preorders are now live on Day 1 &amp; Deluxe Editions of Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Nintendo Switch, PS5, and NSW2 (Game on Cart)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pre-orders for the standard edition (priced at $79.99 CAD) and deluxe edition of this Legacy Kollection are now live on the same website, but there's no mention on these particular pages about the product being a "game on cart" release, so you might want to hold off until there's a more official confirmation.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of third-party Switch 2 titles have shipped with the entire game on the game card. One of these was CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, with the company even acknowledging the importance of physical media, and to not "underestimate the physical edition" of games.</p>

<p>To send off Nintendo's recent Partner Showcase, Square Enix announced some new projects, and one of them happened to be the brand new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>.</p>
<p>This is an action RPG where the combat will take place in real-time instead of the usual turn-based battles you might be used to in certain other titles. It's also developed by Team Asano (the developers behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default</a>).</p>
<p>In case you missed it, a demo is now available on the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms, and Square Enix has issued a reminder about this along with some information about what to expect if you haven't already played it:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067oznmuy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This ‘Debut Demo’ is designed to give you a sense of the exploration and action you’ll experience in the game, so expect plenty of crunchy combat, spooky caves and all kinds of secrets hidden around.</p>
<p>See a crackable wall? Blow it to smithereens with a bomb and you might discover a Secret Treasure Route- a small dungeon you can explore for valuable rewards.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find a Shrine of Life - these optional challenges put your combat and traversal skills to the test. Perhaps you’ll find valuable loot like magicite or money. Always remember - this is a game that rewards the curious.</p>
<p>Or, you could follow the quest markers and delve into a deadly swamp, and the Unexplored Ruins beneath. This multi-level dungeon is full of dangers - so be sure to use everything you’ve learned to find your way through.</p>
