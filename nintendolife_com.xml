<p>Now that's a shock</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, Nightdive Studios is bringing yet <em>another</em> game to the Switch later this year — and Switch 2 as well. This time around, the developer has revealed that it's porting its acclaimed 2023 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake to both consoles in 2025 with the full game on the cartridge.</p>
<p>The news dropped during the Indie Horror Showcase, and it makes for a rather nice surprise, especially as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> only just launched earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version of the game, which is a remake of one of the most-influential first-person RPG shooters of all time, will support mouse controls, and come with 1080p and 60fps out of the box. Both Switch 1 and 2 releases will also be fully playable with gyro.</p>
<p>Nightdive Studios have remained extremely faithful to the 1994 original, instead focusing on updated controls, updated interfaces, and updated music and sounds. But really, we're all here to face off against one of gaming's greatest villains in SHODAN, right?</p>

<p>Many absolutely loved the remake back when it launched on PC in 2023, with a console port following the year after. Over <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/system-shock">on Push Square</a>, however, they were a little more critical, citing that the game was "showing its age" a little. So be prepared for a bit of a blast from the past there!</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>As we approach the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, The Pokémon Company has lifted the lid on a brand new expansion that will be arriving in the app next week.</p>
<p>The "Mega Rising' expansion bursts onto the scene one week today, on <strong>30th October</strong>, and, as the name suggests, it'll bring a Mega Evolution twist to proceedings. Mega Gyarados, Mega Blaziken and Mega Altaria take to the covers of this new set, and all users will receive one of each on launch day <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>That's to celebrate the app's one-year anniversary, for which TPC has announced new Special Missions, and reissued Special Drop and Wonder Pick events. The "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">New and Updated</a>" app features that were teased earlier this month will also arrive on 30th October, so keep an eye out for improved Wonder Picks, a new share feature, and an expanded number of tradable cards.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at some of the chase cards from the new expansion:</p>


<p>While this writer wishes the new releases would slow down a little, we can't imagine that it'll happen any time soon. The Pokémon Company today announced that the app has surpassed 150 million downloads in its first year, which is a <em>crazy</em> number when you think about it. Expect the new expansions to keep on rolling out, we guess.</p>
