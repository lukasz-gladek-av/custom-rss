<p>Hmmm, we've heard this one before</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario RPG Kissing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4fe6194595fe8/super-mario-rpg-kissing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's official, folks — Mario and Peach are <em>not</em> in a relationship. Nintendo said it, so it <em>must</em> be true.</p>
<p>A few days ago, on the Nintendo Today! App, the Big N dropped this major bombshell on the world, revealing that the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the Italian plumber are simply "good friends". We missed the initial post, but thankfully, <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122">KirPinkFury</a> has us covered.</p>
<p>So, wait, is this despite the fact Peach has kissed Mario multiple times and baked multiple cakes for him? We know both of these acts <em>are</em> platonic (cheek kissing, baking), but... okay.</p>

<p>This all sounds a little familiar, right? Another darling Nintendo couple, Zelda and Link, are frequently under the microscope from fans. Are they in a relationship? Aren't they?</p>
<p>Zelda's voice actor, Patricia Summerset, once said "I know that [Link and Zelda] are in a relationship with each other" in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/patricia-summersett-interview-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">TheGamer</a> as part of a wider conversation about enjoying the ambiguity of their relationship, before putting out a <a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660696953712197635">statement a few days later saying</a> that her words do "not imply" that the duo are in love.</p>
<p>Really, though, all of this is up to fan interpretation. If Mario and Peach want some privacy, that's great. Nintendo can insist the pair aren't a couple — and maybe that's the case. To be fair, Peach <em>did</em> turn down Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Next thing Nintendo will be telling us is that Donkey Kong doesn't love bananas.</p>
