Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, but you'd be mistaken. Here to show even more in the gameplay department for both games is a brand new Nintendo Treehouse presentation.</p>
<p>The Treehouse is set to kick off shortly, promising 80 minutes of gameplay between the two titles. Remember, both Mario Wonder and Pokopia have already received overview trailers of their own, so we expect today's presentation to be more about the <em>vibe</em> of playing, hopefully giving us an even closer look at what's in store.</p>
<p>Here's the exact time that the presentation will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 2pm PST / 3pm MST / 4pm CST / 5pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 10pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 11pm CET / 12am (Wed) EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 7am (Wed) JST / 6am (Wed) AWST / 9am (Wed) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>The full Treehouse event is being livestreamed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8SyOGO_ubSo">YouTube</a>, but if you want to chat along with your fellow Nintendo Lifers while you watch, then we've got you covered with the stream below.</p>
<p>So, grab 80 minutes' worth of snacks and drinks, and let's get ready for some gameplay!</p>
