<p>It's no big deal, right? I'll be able to play just fine with the sound off, I told myself. Sure, I'd miss out on all of Pharloom's wonderful sound cues, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q6is6K8jbho?si=9KC0ivCNN6YtxW7D">Christopher Larkin's staggering score</a>, and arguably be at a disadvantage for just about every enemy encounter going forward, but it's not the end of the world...</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957zujwko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Reader, at the time, it was the end of the world.</p>
<p>I was on this plane on 5th September, a mere 24 hours after finally getting my hands on Silksong — one of my most-anticipated games <em>ever</em>. I had put maybe three hours into it the day before, but I was saving myself for the big flight because, well, I'm pretty terrified of air travel and there's nothing like a bit of bug depression to take your mind off being in a pressurised tin can, thousands of feet in the air.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that I decided to bravely soldier and play the damn game regardless. I knew how sound worked in Pharloom at this point, and I knew that it would probably hurt my exploration as a consequence of being without it. But my options were to plough on sans headphones, or read the safety information booklet for the eleventh time and do some breathing exercises.</p>
<p>I returned to my save file and prepared myself for four hours of non-ideal playtime. Three steps into the rainy streets of Greymoor, and all of my stresses dissipated. Why? Because Team Cherry knows how to rumble. HD Rumble, that is.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1bb206182b5d0"><a title="Silksong Rumble" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1bb206182b5d0/silksong-rumble.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As my beloved Hornet stepped out from the area's initial cover and into the downpour, I felt the faint pitter-patter of the drops rumbling in my Joy-Con. Of course, HD Rumble 2 itself is far from news to me — yeah, I paid attention in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> — but these raindrops immediately drew my attention to it in a way that I hadn't noticed it on the console so far.</p>
<p>It wasn't the big buzz I felt when getting punched by a Pilgrim Groveller or Binding that made me perk up and pay attention to the rumble, but these tiny, inconsequential raindrops. Why? Because I hadn't even noticed it was raining in the area.</p>
<p>Without the distraction of sound, I suddenly became acutely aware of how HD Rumble 2 was being used to tell me something I might have otherwise missed. It's easy to tell when a pesky Pharlid is going to pop up from underground once you learn the rumble that announces its arrival. Likewise, that one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/i-have-no-words-silksong-fans-are-losing-their-minds-over-one-bench">nasty trap bench</a> in Hunter's March is far easier avoided if you feel for the click of the spikes before they come swinging down.</p>
<p>Pleasantly pleased with my discovery, I started dashing around Pharloom, taking great joy in the initial <em>BZZT</em> and ensuing mini-<em>bzzts</em> that mark Hornet's initial boost and subsequent speedy steps. I might have been missing out on the odd map thanks to my inability to hear Shakra's singing, but I was exploring in a whole new way.</p>

<p>My tactile travels led me to the Chapel of the Beast in Hunters March, where a series of ever-growing vibrations signposted that something very big and very scary was stomping about inside. As all those who have ventured into this area can attest, there is indeed something very big and very scary inside, and I only wish that I had listened to the intensity of the rumble and taken it as a message to <em>steer clear</em>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I kept on playing in such a manner, guiding my movements via the rumble. The big boss at the end of Act 1 was a pain in the butt, but my soundless attempts would have taken me days was it not for the gradually-increasing rumble letting me know when an off-screen shock attack was heading my way.</p>
<p>Before I had a chance to feel even more like Aragorn tracking an army of Uruk-hai by placing my palm to the ground and feeling out the footsteps, the plane landed and I packed my Switch away.</p>
<p>I had a lovely holiday, thanks for asking. It was mainly spent reading books in the sun and trying to think about anything other than the dark depths of Pharloom. But, rest assured, I made a point to charge my headphones for the flight back.</p>
<p>There's no denying it; the Silksong soundscape is <em>fantastic</em>. Larkin's strings have damn near brought me to tears on several occasions, I grin like a fool whenever I hear Shakra's "Ooshka-ah-aah-ro, kai-lai-lai-lai, ooshka-ro", and the singe of heat or chill of cold comes with its own little aural pang that really sells the '<em>I need to move right now</em>'. I wouldn't want to play the game in its entirety without it, but good grief, it's <em>still</em> a wild ride for those brave enough to reach for the mute button.</p>
<p>So go on, take those headphones out, turn the volume down to zero, or otherwise plug your ears up for a second and take a quick tour around the rumbling roads of Pharloom. Trust me, it's not a feeling to be missed.</p>

<p>Developed by Newfangled Games, Paper Trail is a cute little puzzle game where all the solutions involve folding paper to create pathways and solutions. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paper-trail">We absolutely loved it</a> when it launched back in May 2024, and we're so glad to see it get a rather gorgeous limited edition.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the EDITION releases, Paper Trail will come with a custom collectible mailer box, a developer interview and essay booklet, slip case artwork from Moy Lee, a gorgeous poster, a colour-thematic inner slipcase, four art cards, an authenticity card, and a second poster with unique artwork and checklist on the back.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vkzrju&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>So far, EDITIONS has been on a roll with its wonderful physicals of hit indie titles.The most recent releases, prior to Paper Trail, were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arco">Arco</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Norco</a> (the latter isn't on Switch; one day, we hope!).

<p>Marketing Director at Lost in Cult Ryan Brown <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">has spoken with us about the issue</a>, and with yesterday's announcement, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/toadsanime.lostincult.co.uk/post/3lzohix27vn2h">reiterated the pledge</a> that "We test all of our Nintendo Switch physicals on the Switch 2, ensuring they also run fine on there, too" to ensure that no release requires the internet to start playing.</p>

<p>Consider this!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9cf8abecb51ea"><a title="kuukiYOMi 4 psa" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cf8abecb51ea/kuukiyomi-4-psa.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: G-Mode</em></figcaption></figure><p>I'm gonna put my hands up here. I'd never even heard of G-Mode's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kuukiyomi_consider_it">Kuukiyomi</a> series before - not once have I ever had it mentioned to me. <em>[Tsk tsk, PJ - you need to catch up on the lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">reader recommendations on nintendolife.com</a>! - Ed.]</em></p>
<p>And I'm puzzled, because judging by the official description of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kuukiyomi-4-consider-it-nintendo-switch-2-edition">KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It</a> — now that my attention has finally been drawn to it by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lznclu5nk222">Daan Koopman</a> and the positive social media reaction you can see below! — it seems like something I was destined to play. It's right up my silly little street, this stuff.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vkzrju&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>The premise here is that you assume the role of an innocent young child, reverting back to a state of mental purity, before being placed into situations where you need to make a call. The game puts it better, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Consider It with innocence while looking back on various events that everyone must have experienced in their childhood.<br>
The basic rule of deciding what to do in situations by moving the red object on the screen is the same. Please consider the situation and read the atmosphere according to the various scenes that will be asked.<br>
A total of 100 situations will be asked. After playing all the questions, your "ability to read the atmosphere” will be diagnosed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've always felt like I needed a diagnosis for that.</p>
<p>Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It then puts you in the sorts of uncomfortable situations that have me howling with laughter, whilst also having a great time making digs at Switch 2 for being hard to find in stores. As you can see in the video above, it specifically references the lottery system Nintendo is running in Japan: <em>"Can you put that console away? It's too blinding to someone like me, who didn't win one."</em></p>
<p>It also utilises the console's features (whilst talking about them in-game), so you get some new mouse and motion-controlled fun and some stuff that wasn't in the Switch 1 version, including five minigames that involve <em>two</em> Joy-Con in Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>Now, the science bit. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Kuukiyomi 4 currently has a 30% discount on the eShop, putting it at £8.04 (or whatever that equates to where you are). And if you bought the Switch 1 version, there's an upgrade pack available for that, also discounted to £3.59 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>So yeah, I'm 100% diving in this weekend to see just how funny it is!</p>
