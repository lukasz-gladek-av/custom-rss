<p>Difficulty levels and better checkpoints in the works</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> is a pretty good game; we should know, we gave it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">7/10 in our review</a>. But many folks have, understandably, criticised it for its often punishing difficulty and stingy checkpoint system.</p>
<p>So, to address this, Bandai Namco has announced update 1.1.0, an upcoming patch that looks to "redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy". It will focus primarily on three key areas: difficulty, movement when controlling PUCK, and the checkpoint system.</p>
<p>Here's what the full announcement entails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who played this game. Each and every one of your opinions is our greatest_asset and the driving force propelling us forward.<br>
<strong><br>
Reflections</strong></p>
<p>We developed Shadow Labyrinth aiming for a unique experience: “Wandering the labyrinth, devouring, and evolving.”</p>
<p>We sincerely acknowledge the many evaluations of the game we’ve received, along with the numerous opinions shared by our players.</p>
<p>Particularly:</p>
<p>- Inconvenience of saving / traveling<br>
- Mini-PUCK play control in MAZE sections<br>
- High difficulty</p>
<p>These were challenges felt by many players, and we strongly feel they are points the development team must sincerely address.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Version Update</strong></p>
<p>The upcoming version update is not merely a bug fix or adjustment. Its purpose is to redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy.</p>
<p>A flexible system allowing players to choose difficulty levels, and improved immersion through comfortable controls and appropriately placed checkpoints.</p>
<p>We will build the next update around those core elements. We hope you look forward to the updated version of Shadow Labyrinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we can't exactly say what "improved immersion through comfortable controls" means, the prospect of difficulty settings and more generous checkpoints will no doubt come as good news to fans.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep you up to date on when this new update is scheduled to drop on Switch and Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Acclaimed indie developer Simogo is celebrating its 15th birthday today, but it feels like we're the one getting presents. Fans of the Swedish studio are going to be thrilled with the projects the team has revealed, so buckle up.</p>
<p>First up (thanks, <a href="https://vgc.news/news/simogo-reveals-7-game-collection-for-switch-and-pc-confirms-sayonara-wild-hearts-for-switch-2/">VGC</a>!) are Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sayonara-wild-hearts-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, two of our favourite games on the Switch. Sharper visuals and frames are likely part of these packages, and we only have to wait until <strong>early next year</strong> to try them out. No upgrade path has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Second, we have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December 2025</strong>. This is a compilation of the studio's first seven titles <em>and</em> a whole host of bonus content which, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/simogo-legacy-collection-announced-for-switch-2-switch-and-pc">Gematsu</a> highlights, including an E-book, an audio drama podcast, unreleased music and art, and a handful of playable prototypes.</p>
<p>All the games in this collection were originally released on iOS, and while some did come to Wii U, most of these have never seen a console release. Simogo actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-dev-teases-switch-port-of-critically-acclaimed-text-adventure">teased one of these earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kosmo Spin</strong> (2010) - a circular arcade game where you're trying to save a planet full of breakfast cereal</li>
<li><strong>Bumpy Road</strong> (2011) - a road trip adventure where you control the road and not the car</li>
<li><strong>Beat Sneak Bandit</strong> (2012) - a rhythmic-based puzzler where you need to sneak inside the mansion to win</li>
<li><strong>Year Walk</strong> (2013) - a first-person adventure based on the Swedish tradition of årsgång, "year walking"</li>
<li><strong>DEVICE 6</strong> (2013) - a text-based puzzler where you guide a woman through an island who doesn't remember getting there</li>
<li><strong>The Sailor's Dream</strong> (2014) - a narrative adventure that changes based on the real-world clock</li>
<li><strong>SPL-T</strong> (2015) <em>-</em> a block-splitting puzzler</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, but by no means least, Simogo has teamed up with the lovely folks at Lost in Cult for <strong><a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">Heartbeats, Dreams and Laser Eyes: 15 Years of Simogo</a></strong>, a stunning book covering the studio's history, philosophy, and inspirations.</p>

<p>Essays from writers Holly Nielsen, Christian Donlan, Nadia Oxford and Aaron Riccio will dive deep into the studio's projects and games, and the book as a whole promises to "provide readers with a deeper understanding of one of the most consistently inventive studios in the business."</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition will be available for a limited time and it'll cost <strong>£69.99</strong> (the standard edition is much cheaper at <strong>£39.99</strong>) — the first 300 copies will come with a signed bookplate from co-founders Simon Flesser and Magnus 'Gordon' Gardebäck. Check out the <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">website for more details</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that's a darn good slate; every single game Simogo has released will be on Switch 1 <em>and</em> Switch 2 come early next year. Plus that book is tasty.</p>
<p>If you haven't played either Lorelei or Sayonara Wild Hearts, what are you <em>doing?</em> Okay, we get it, lots of games — check out our reviews for both (below) if you're curious.</p>
