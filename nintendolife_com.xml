<figure data-uuid="27deebf30322b"><a title="Persona 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27deebf30322b/persona-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/persona_5">Persona 5</a> originally released in Japan in September 2016, which means it's been nearly a <em>decade</em> since the latest mainline entry first hit shelves. Fans are exceptionally eager to see what <strong>'Persona 6'</strong> might look like, and according to a brief tease from the franchise's <a href="https://asia.sega.com/p30th/en/">30th anniversary website</a>, we might not be waiting too much longer to get our first glimpse.</p>
<p>As covered by our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/persona-anniversary-site-mentions-next-chapter-for-the-series">Push Square</a>, the Google link to the 30th Anniversary website includes a short snippet of information that reads: "Come celebrate the journey as we usher in the next chapter for the series."</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that this could be referring to the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> which, at the time of writing, has not yet been confirmed for the Switch 2. That seems a little odd though, right? To us, "the next chapter" is more likely a reference to the inevitable brand-new game which, unless something drastic happens, is likely to be called Persona 6.</p>
<p>But still, we're not going to get <em>too</em> excited for the time being. It's a really small piece of information and we think it would be a remarkable coincidence if a Google description was our first official indication of Persona 6.</p>
<p>Atlus will no doubt have much more to say as we work our way through 2026, so we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>But current memory prices are not an immediate concern</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8e1e52e2c736d"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8e1e52e2c736d/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been the subject of much debate since its launch last year, with many speculating that the current economy might necessitate a price increase for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a>, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa has remained coy on any potential product price increases, simply stating "I cannot comment on hypotheticals". Seems like a pretty understandable statement to make; Furukawa won't want to cause any panic by insinuating that prices may indeed go up.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Kyoto Shinbun article is locked behind a paid subscription model, so the kind folks at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w2yyporceaqxdbzfupn5lcbt/post/3mc5ut4rnmk2f">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> have highlighted some of the key points from the interview. In addition to Furukawa's comment on price rises, he also noted that the current memory prices – which are on the rise thanks to the huge requirement needed for AI chips – will have "no immediate impact on [Nintendo's] financial performance", but he will nevertheless monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>In slightly lighter news, Furukawa confirmed that Nintendo is working on both established franchises and completely new content, which probably won't come a a massive surprise. He also reaffirms Nintendo's desire to expand its work in the movie space, while noting that a potential venture into anime isn't completely ruled out.</p>
<p>We're not surprised to see such vague answers from Furukawa, since getting any sort of comment from Nintendo is like getting blood from a stone. Regardless, it's nice to get at least a <em>bit</em> of context as we head into the new year.</p>
