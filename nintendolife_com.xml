<p>The local release will be published by NIS America, but we don't have a release date just yet. On a more positive note, a Switch 2 version (and Game-Key Card physical release) has also been confirmed. It's arriving in Japan alongside the Switch, PlayStation and PC release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yvshni&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The Japanese release will include standard and premium physical options (with the fancier one including a copy of the game, a scale plastic kit and an acrylic stand set):</p>
<figure><a title="R-TYPE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c2b06b5f47ca/r-type.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>This title was previously targeting a 2025 launch, after it was delayed in September 2024. So hopefully the wait will finally be over early next year. If we hear any updates about the local release date or window, we'll let you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Remember how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_tactics_i_b_ii_cosmos"><strong>R-Type Tactics I • II Cosmos</strong></a> by Granzilla was meant to be coming to the Switch this year? Well, it's now been delayed (again).</p>
<p>In an update during a live stream, the developer announced the title would be arriving on Nintendo's hybrid system in <strong>2025</strong> instead of Fall 2024. No reason was attached to this delay, but the developer has apologised once again.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, this package will contain the turn-based strategy tactical RPG's <strong>R-Type Tactics</strong> (Command in the West) and <strong>R-Type Tactics II: Operation Bitter Chocolate</strong>. You can find out more about these releases in our existing coverage.</p>

<p>Super Mario's 40th anniversary is now underway and Nintendo's been promoting it with all sorts of announcements and reveals.</p>
<p>As part of the ongoing celebrations, next month <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is returning for Switch. Ahead of this, Nintendo has also announced a new wave of themed Switch Online icons. It features a bunch of characters from this particular universe such as Mario and Rosalina.</p>
<p>The first wave gets underway next week on 25th September, with the second wave following on 1st October and the final wave scheduled for 8th October. Each of these icons will set you back 10 Platinum Points, with borders and backgrounds priced at 5 Platinum Points each.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy icons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/65ea2fe64dc62/super-mario-galaxy-icons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This week also marks the final wave of Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World icons (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52976-final-wave-of-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-icons-now-available-for-switch-online">thanks, GoNintendo</a>).</p>
<p>Apart from these icons, Nintendo has also released a new seven-minute overview trailer for Galaxy + Galaxy 2, showcasing the gameplay and extra content in this title. Earlier this week the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app got a Galaxy 2 update as well, adding 70 tracks (with a run time of 2 hours and 9 minutes).</p>

<p>Going beyond the Mushroom Kingdom</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> games are back with not only a new movie but also an updated package for the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>If you're not sold on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> just yet, Nintendo has now released a new seven-minute overview trailer which outlines not only the gameplay but also the new content and updates. In case you did miss it, this includes enhanced resolution, improved UI, extra storybook chapters, the new assist mode, amiibo support, and more!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With enhanced resolution (1080p on Nintendo Switch/4K* on Nintendo Switch 2), improved UI, extra Storybook Chapters, a new Assist Mode, and more, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 are now out of this world!"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, this trailer has only been released in Japan, but there's still enough on display to get an idea of what's on the way. When an English version of the trailer is released (or a similar trailer is made available), we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>One other thing that's been spotted in this overview is two new storybook pages. Although it's all in Japanese, it seems <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52980-two-new-rosalina-s-storybook-pages-from-super-mario-galaxy-2-revealed">they've already been translated</a>. Nintendo will also be releasing a physical version of Rosalina's Storybook, but it's worth noting, the new chapters and pages <em>won't</em> be included.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the storybook and the updated versions of the Galaxy games in our previous coverage:</p>

<p>Two Namco games join 'Nintendo Classics'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be expanding its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service with two more games for the Game Boy Advance library.</p>
<p>They include the Namco titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mr_driller_2">Mr. Driller 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a>, and they'll be arriving next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>. The puzzle title Mr. Driller 2 started life in arcades and was then ported to the GBA for the system's Japanese launch.</p>
<p>The puzzle-platform title Klonoa: Empire of Dreams debuted on the GBA in 2001 and allows you take control of Klonoa as you take down enemies, solve puzzles and jump your way through 40 incredible stages. Here's Nintendo's official description these titles:</p>
<h3>KLONOA Empire of Dreams</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The ruler of a distant empire suffers from a serious case of sleepless nights. In his torment, Emperor Jillius passes a law forbidding his loyal subjects from ever dreaming again! One morning, our hero Klonoa and his friend Huepow find themselves in front of the emperor, charged with dreaming of<br>
adventure. As punishment for their crimes, they must defeat the four monsters that plague the lands.</p>
<p>Play as Klonoa and take down enemies with the ever-trusty Wind Bullet. Solve puzzles and collect helpful items like stars as you jump your way through 40 incredible stages! Help Klonoa in his journey to redeem himself and find out just why dreams have become so taboo...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Mr. Driller2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Join Susumu and Anna as a mysterious outbreak of Blocks threatens the world's existence once more. Armed with a mighty drill, dig deep through multicolored blocks until you reach safety. Not all blocks will be breakable, so be careful that the blocks you break don't cause others to fall on you or cut off your Air Supply! Scramble to grab air capsules for a recharge, and you'll be just fine to reach your goal. How deep can you dig underground? Drill to your heart's content in three modes: Mission Driller, Endless Driller, and Time Attack Driller!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Japan will receive the same two titles next week. And as usual, these games come with modern benefits such as the ability to save and load on the fly, and even rewind your gameplay.</p>
<p>The GBA app was also recently updated to Version 3.0.0 (alongside the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a> in Japan). It includes button remapping options and even 1080p support in handheld mode on the Switch 2. You can find out more about this update in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-onlines-gba-app-has-been-updated-version-3-0-0">our previous story</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be revisiting these GBA games on Nintendo's subscription service next week? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Coming to Switch platforms later this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of release, Dotemu and Tribute Games have slowly been revealing new playable characters. This week, a new trailer has dropped for Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider. An official description for both of these characters has also been shared:</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"King T’Challa, the Black Panther and stalwart leader of Wakanda, dashes into battle wielding his vibranium-enhanced suit and sonic daggers. With peerless martial arts skills and strength, he’ll pounce on any threat or foe foolish enough to challenge him!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Cosmic Ghost Rider</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, Cosmic Ghost Rider can’t let that go unpunished. Atop his Hell cycle, this wild incarnation of the Rider roars across the spaceways. Beware: this Spirit of Stellar Vengeance punishes by wielding both hellfire and the Power Cosmic!"</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/374ff05d60a66/marvel-cosmic-invasion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvel, Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the previous character reveals include heroes like Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill, with the rest of the roster made up of Marvel classics like Captain America, X-Men characters, and Spider-Man. Together they'll travel from "New York City to the depths of the Negative Zone" to fight for the future of the universe.</p>
