<p>Limited Run Games has dropped a patch today that fixes previous compatibility issues which prevented the game from working properly on the new console.</p>
<p>"The day has arrived, and GEX Trilogy's Switch 2 compatibility patch has finally been approved!" The company posted <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1937488404796604537">on social media</a>. All you have to do is download the update and you should be able to jump into Crystal Dynamics' classic gecko-starring trilogy.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxnwiy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>For anyone holding out for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/gex-trilogy-lands-june-release-special-edition-with-blow-up-doll-revealed">physical release</a> — which includes some special artwork from <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> artist Yoshitaka Amano, of all people — the patch will be included on the cartridge. Phew!</p>
<p>The physical games publisher has been having a number of issues with its Carbon Engine games on the Switch 2 since the console's launch. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">last week's firmware update</a> from Nintendo seems to have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpyclnj2s">fixed a bunch of them</a>, but problems with Gex did for LRG to ask Nintendo to pull the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's no need for that to happen now! We're meant to be getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gex-trilogy-adding-pal-versions-and-voices-in-its-next-update">the PAL versions in a future update</a>, alongside the iconic UK voice acting, too, so there's never been a better time to play Gex.</p>

<p>The news was confirmed via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app with an accompanying trailer (which we'll embed above as soon as it's available online).</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the game will be an eShop exclusive, so don't expect a physical release for this one.</p>
<p><em>Drag X Drive was originally announced during the big April Direct for the Switch 2 as a 3v3 multiplayer-focused experience in which players use the mouse controls in both Joy-Con to move 'vehicle'-bound characters and shoot hoops to score points.</em></p>
<p><em>We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-drag-x-drive-is-fantastic-but-is-it-destined-to-be-switch-2s-arms">hands-on with the game</a> shortly after its announcement and praised the mouse controls, saying "it seems like a great fit and is pretty darn responsive". There is, however, an undeniable concernt that the game may not provide long-term engagement thanks to its rather limited premise.</em> <em><br></em></p>

<p>Picking up where the 2023 Netflix movie '<strong>Dawn of the Nugget</strong>' left off, <strong>Chicken Run: Eggstraction</strong> (see what they did there?) will see you assisting a team of hens on their mission to infiltrate five nasty chicken farms and free their captives.</p>
<p>This is a top-down heist game, all about picking the right team for the job and using your recruits' special skills to bypass the farms' security measures.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154971/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It’s going on <em>seven years</em> since the first chapter of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_1">Deltarune</a> became available and after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_2">Chapter 2</a> in 2021, we’re now finally past the halfway mark of the story with the simultaneous release of Chapters 3 and 4. To mark the occasion, Toby Fox has decided to give the game an ‘official' paid release, including all chapters to this point, plus the final upcoming chapters whenever they complete development, and it feels like it was the right choice to do so now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> is an incomplete, but ultimately satisfying experience that already feels like a worthy successor to the legacy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>.</p>
<p>The story follows Kris, a quiet teenager living in a small town populated mostly with monsters, and their adventures in a mysterious Dark World they discover in the hall closet at their school with their friend, Susie. The two are told that they are prophesied heroes who will restore balance between the Light and Dark Worlds, and they soon learn that their main means of doing so is through finding and sealing various Dark Fountains that act as a sort of source of power for the Dark World. Joined by Ralsei, a native of the Dark World, the heroes set out to battle the forces defending the Dark Fountains and ultimately fulfil their destiny as the prophecy lays out.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156993/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It may sound like a rather clichéd premise, but Deltarune excels in defying expectations and keeping the player guessing. This is the kind of narrative that you quickly realise isn’t actually as simple as it initially appears, but answers about what’s <em>really</em> going on are trickled out slowly while new mysteries are continually introduced left and right.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, a sardonic and satirical sense of humour permeates the writing, keeping the tone lighthearted and airy until another sudden heel-turn where things get real <em>fast</em>. And while the jury’s still out on how this is all going to resolve, the latest chapters start building some welcome momentum as this narrative hurtles towards a conclusion.</p>
<p>Gameplay could be most closely described as that of a JRPG, but Deltarune bucks genre trends with some remarkably interesting and fresh gameplay ideas. For example, the turn-based battles you find yourself often drawn into not only include rhythm-based elements (like you’d find in something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a>) but also include creative bullet hell segments when your party is on the defensive. Here, you must manoeuvre a heart around a small box as enemy attacks come at it from all sides.</p>

<p>Then there’s the matter of how pacifism is still pitched as a legitimate response to enemy encounters—you can choose to spare your foes instead of killing them, and this can even have later implications for the story.</p>
<p>It may be borrowing a lot of its combat elements from Undertale, but Deltarune generally does a great job of giving you plenty of combat agency while keeping you on your toes in those bullet hell sections. This certainly isn’t the kind of RPG that you mostly do on autopilot, dealing with the same enemies in the same boring ways, and the dynamism in battles is what helps the experience stay interesting and innovative.</p>
<p>To keep things fresh, Chapter 3 also introduces some minigames that totally change up the gameplay. Here, you can do arcade-like activities like dishing out food to hungry customers, defending a statue from waves of attacking foes, or exploring a brief and weird version of a top-down Zelda game. Though Chapter 3 itself had some mild pacing issues, I really enjoyed the gameplay gimmicks that it explored and appreciated the variety that it injected into the overall loop.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156982/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, Deltarune employs a very basic, but charming art style that ultimately goes for a lot of sight gags that play into the comical nature of most of the writing. My particular favourite instance was Tenna, a game show host with a TV for a head introduced in Chapter 3. Not only do most of his sentences contain phrases written in WordArt and accompanied by goofy sounds, but the character himself is drawn and animated in a completely different style from the world around him that intentionally clashes with everything else. Deltarune doesn’t necessarily impress with its otherwise simple visuals, but there’s something about its rudimentary spritework that fits well with the script's often silly tone.</p>
<p>As for the soundtrack, Toby Fox proves himself yet again to be a master of creating atmosphere. Whether it be the eerie ambient sounds that play when exploring a desolate hallway in the dark world or the intense chiptune tracks that punctuate many of the battle sequences, this is an effective soundtrack that manages to be both deep and varied.</p>
<p>Though it now feels like Deltarune has finally begun to establish for itself a more distinct identity from its predecessor with the addition of Chapters 3 and 4, the biggest issue with it at the time of writing is simply that it clearly isn’t yet a finished game. It feels like the available content certainly justifies the sticker price now being charged, yet there’s a lingering feeling of dissatisfaction upon reaching the end of Chapter 4 and recognising that it’ll be who knows how long before the concluding chapter is finally completed.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156974/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I wouldn’t say this is reason enough to skip playing Deltarune now, but just keep in mind that it’ll probably be years before development finally reaches completion.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2 port itself, one of the key headlining features is a special room that allows you to utilize the new Mouse Mode for some cute mini-games. Here, you save a couple “Maice” from a cat statue, eventually leading to a battle with a cat in which you use both Joy-Con to move the pointers around to do things like dodge attacks or play a version of Simon Says.</p>
<p>It’s not particularly innovative or game-changing, but this special room is a fun little distraction and it gives the Switch 2 version a bit of distinctive content to differentiate it from other versions.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157006/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those of you who have played the earlier chapters on the original Switch will be pleased to note, too, that there’s a built-in save import feature for this full release of Deltarune. If your old save data is loaded on the same console as Deltarune when you first boot it up, this will be automatically detected and you’ll be given the option to carry over your save data for chapters three and four. Alternatively, you can simply start fresh and play any of the four available chapters in any order you want.</p>
<p>I appreciated that Toby Fox thought to include this feature, as it ensures the transition to new hardware and the ‘full’ release goes as smoothly as possible.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Deltarune is a game that can feel odd to recommend, as it’s both difficult to convey in words what makes this game feel special and… well, it still isn’t <em>done</em>. Its goofy and subversive narrative, innovative battle mechanics, and killer soundtrack all combine to make this one worth the purchase in its current state, even if it is unfinished and the visuals still feel a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>At any rate, I’d suggest you pick this one up; there’s no telling when the story will finally wrap up, but the release of the latest two chapters has done a lot to round out what once felt a little anaemic.</p></section>
