<p>The marketing campaign begins</p>

<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fb4f26fb073a/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're slowly learning more about the upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> movie, and following the reveal of the first cast members in July, it appears an official social media account has now been opened on the platform X (formerly known as Twitter).</p>
<p>It's tagged as <a href="https://x.com/The_Zelda_Movie">@The_Zelda_Movie</a> and in the bio mentions how the film is coming "exclusively to theatres in 2027". This follows the previous confirmation that the film would arrive on <strong>7th May 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>Notably, this account, which originally joined the platform in November 2023, has been verified as an affiliate of Sony Pictures (which is already following it back). This new page is also following the official PlayStation account. As you might recall, Sony is co-financing this project.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there have been no official news updates from the account just yet, but the page has reposted multiple stories about the cast announcements. While it's not following any Nintendo accounts just yet, it has reposted <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335">Miyamoto's recent update from the Nintendo account</a> about the actors.</p>

<p>As you can see, the social account page also has a simple banner with the title 'The Legend of Zelda' in the middle.</p>
<p>Again, this follows on from the actor reveals last month – confirming Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. You can find out more about this movie in our full guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Evil Marian and Super Anubis join the fight</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a> is the gift that keeps on giving, with Maximum Entertainment and developer Secret Base today adding two more playable characters to the beat 'em up as a free DLC update.</p>
<p>This time it's the "Evil Marian" and "Super Anubis" joining the fight. They follow on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/double-dragon-gaiden-doubles-the-fun-with-a-free-dlc-update-on-switch">Jeff and Abore</a> earlier this year in April. Here's the official rundown about each fighter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Evil Marian</strong> - Once a trusted ally, Marian is now under the grip of an unknown, malevolent force. Cold and distant, she floats above the ground, lashing out with psychic blasts and violent telekinesis. Her eyes are vacant, her voice devoid of emotion—something ancient has taken hold of her...and it’s not letting go.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Super Anubis</strong> - For years, whispers claimed Anubis was a fraud, a cult figure with no true power. But now, Super Anubis has emerged: levitating, glowing, and summoning dark forces beyond comprehension. The question lingers—was he a fake all along...or a prophet finally revealed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this release, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is currently on sale on Switch and Steam for 65% off. Since its original release in July 2023, this title has also received multiple other game updates, boosting the character roster and adding online play.</p>

<p>No "download required" banner in sight</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Grand Theft Auto Trilogy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8fa8bdfdd1f85/grand-theft-auto-trilogy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Rockstar Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">arrival of Game-Key Cards</a> on the Switch 2, there has been ongoing discussion about the future of third-party physical releases. Even during the Switch generation, certain hard copy releases didn't always live up to expectations, opting to include a download code instead of the actual game.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/story-of-seasons-publisher-says-physical-switch-2-releases-are-the-right-decision-for-us">some more welcome stories</a>, and with this in mind, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/51707-gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-sees-physical-release-with-no-download-required">there are reports today</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy</a> is now available as a proper physical release on the original Switch platform after all this time.</p>
<p>This information comes via an Amazon listing for North America, with the box art no longer including a small banner mentioning download requirements. According to the same page, the release of this version was last month, and the page for the Switch release requiring a download is still live (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-release/">thanks for the heads up, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>You can see the 'before' and 'after' shots in the social post below, which asks who will "take one for the team" and find out if this is actually the real deal by ordering a copy. Notably, it's also cheaper than the existing version that requires a download.</p>

<p>Although this is just a single listing, it's already got quite a lot of attention from Switch owners who have wanted a physical version with no downloads required to play. If it is accurate, hopefully, it comes with the more recent updates <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/rockstar-games-announces-acquisition-of-dev-behind-gta-trilogy-upgrades">by the developer 'Video Games Deluxe'</a>, who took over from the 'Grove Street Games' port team.</p>

<p>Chibi-Robo returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> to the Switch 2's GameCube library next week on <strong>21st August, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This title was one of the many games confirmed alongside the reveal of the GameCube library for the Switch Online service. It originally made its debut on the GameCube in 2005/06 and was developed by the team at Skip.</p>
<p>Here's some official PR about what to expect from this title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little robot who wants to bring happiness to all!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube™ system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To play Chibi-Robo on Switch 2, you'll need to have an active subscription to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service.</p>
<p>Some of the other GameCube titles confirmed for the Switch Online's GameCube service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>. This next update follows on from last month's release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>.</p>
