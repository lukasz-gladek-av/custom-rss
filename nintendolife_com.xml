<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f75f64ff116d8/magical-quest-3-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Looking back at last week, we checked out Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the N64, pitting North America and Europe against Japan. It wasn't even close either, with the western design winning with a resounding 89% of the vote. 89%! We quite like the Japanese design too...</p>
<p>This week, we're looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/disneys_magical_quest_3_starring_mickey_and_donald">Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey And Donald</a> for the GBA. Why? Because that's the one I found first, okay? Released in 2005, it was a port of the original 1995 SNES version and received fairly middling reviews, with most finding it to be a lesser game than its predecessors.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fkzpoqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But let's cut to the chase. It's a full blown brawl this week with three combatants. So let's get cracking!</p>
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9399360f08982/magical-quest-3-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe and Japan share similarities this week, but it's North America that went down a different route with its approach. It's still got Mickey and Donald front and centre, but they're chilling out in a forest area, and Mickey is all kitted out in his knight's armour. Rad.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0d9879bc381f/magical-quest-3-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design seems slightly more action-packed, and Donald's wearing a different costume here too. Both characters are punching and whacking enemies, while the logo design itself is similar to North America's albeit with a dark shadow surrounding the letters.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e8c60871b7bf/magical-quest-3-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's design uses the same artworks as Europe's, but you can see a bit more of it this time. We love the logo design here too, but we must admit that the yellow background is kinda gross.</p>

<p>And why some classics didn't return</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> rolled out on multiple platforms this week, and while it's a fantastic throwback to the glory days of the series, there are obviously some differences. Apart from the changes to THPS4, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">the soundtrack</a> is missing some notable classics.</p>
<p>The Birdman himself <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">already explained to fans months ago</a> how he wanted to include "some different songs" – including different songs by some of the same artists.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://youtu.be/W_PvXRze24U">recent interview with BBC News</a>, he reiterated how this decision was not only about introducing players to new music they might not have heard before, but also reminding fans he's not the only one who makes the call about the game's soundtrack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tony Hawk:</strong> "These days, just what I think fits, and what I'm interested in – I'm not the only decider in these soundtracks, but I did manage to throw a couple of bands in... I also picked songs by artists that were already in the game, but a different song, and not everyone agreed with that decision, but I feel like 'let's keep it fresh' and also 'here's help discovering other music', and I think in the beginning that's what people expected of it – once the soundtrack was a prominent part of the game, people were like 'ok' what are you going to throw at us now?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His latest comments about the game's soundtrack also respond to a question about why <a href="https://youtu.be/-NPLYBIwjjg">Alien Ant Farm's song 'Wish'</a> was excluded from the latest release – with the reason once again tied to the concept of making room for "new acts and new songs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wasn't zeroing in on them per say, it was more we're trying to make room for new acts and new songs as well, and not everything makes the cut, it's nothing personal, and I appreciate that people have a fondness for that song [Wish], especially in relation to our game, so you know, just fire it up on your streaming service if you're so inclined."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70c87ee8ffe45/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-plus-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The previous release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> adopted a similar approach with the soundtrack, and <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/au/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-new-skaters">the character roster in the latest game</a> follows the same format (like the previous game) – mixing legends and new pro talent. Tony touched on this in the same interview, along with the selection process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was trying to keep it modern obviously, whilst still respecting the legends that we had in the previous games, and also it was a matter of who was still actively skating, who was still in the scene. It's a delicate balance, but I'm really excited to have people like Chloe Covell, to have Rayssa from Brazil, and Andy Anderson."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skater and Jackass star <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/bam-margera-officially-confirmed-for-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Bam Magera also made it in at the late stages</a> of development, and so Tony "immediately hit up Activision" asking it to include him.

<p>Cracking down on piracy</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38585bf10eedc/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, a major Switch ROM site known as 'nsw2u' was seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>Now, we've got an official statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, highlighting the other sites seized. Here it is in full (via the official FBI website):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FBI Atlanta Seizes Major Video Game Piracy Websites</strong></p>
<div><p>The FBI's Atlanta Field Office announced today the seizure of several online criminal marketplaces providing pirated versions of popular video games.</p><p>

In addition to the seizure, the FBI has dismantled the infrastructure of these websites.</p><p>

For more than four years, the websites contained pirated copies of highly anticipated video games days or weeks before their official release date.</p><p>

Between February 28, 2025, and May 28, 2025, records indicate a total of 3.2 million downloads occurred on these sites from the most used download service. These actions resulting in an estimated loss of $170 million.</p><p>

As part of the actions announced today, the FBI has obtained authorization to seize the domain of multiple sites, to include nsw2u.com, nswdl.com, game-2u.com, bigngame.com, ps4pkg.com, ps4pkg.net, and mgnetu.com. These domains hosted and facilitated access to the pirated video games. Anyone visiting these sites will now view a seizure banner that notifies them the domain has been seized by federal authorities.</p></div></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yisunq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"We're aware that performance may drop"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f9ec0e258b23/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is shaping up to be an excellent outing for DK, but the recent previews did highlight some performance concerns.</p>
<p>The game's director Kazuya Takahashi has now reportedly acknowledged these issues in a chat with the <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Spanish outlet Lavanguardia</a> – seemingly confirming these frame rate drops will be in the final build during more destructive moments of the game. For Nintendo, it was instead apparently about prioritising "fun and playability".</p>
<p>Here's Takahashi's full response (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-frame-rate-drops-director/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8owjulr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There are several factors to consider. First, we intentionally used effects like hit-stop and slow motion to emphasize impacts. Second, because we use voxel technology, there are times when there are major changes and destruction in the environment. We’re aware that performance may drop slightly at these times. However, as you say, overall the game is smooth, and at points where large-scale changes occur, we prioritized fun and playability.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there will be some slight drops, as Takahashi mentions, the "overall" experience is still smooth.</p>
<p>In our recent preview of Donkey Kong Bananza, we noted how the experience in this new release felt a bit like a "TOTK situation" where the performance might not be perfect, but you forgive it for its ambition. So, if you're jumping into DK's new adventure on release and encounter changes in performance, don't be surprised.</p>
<p>We'll deliver our full review for Donkey Kong Bananza next week, so you can find out then how the final build performs.</p>

<p>Latency, performance and resolution investigated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>GameCube has joined the Switch 2's library of classic games, and it was recently updated with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. While the service's experience has been fun so far, there have also been some reports of underlying issues with the emulation.</p>
<p>Now, Digital Foundry has tested GameCube emulation and backward compatibility – investigating latency, analogue stick issues, frame drop issues on Switch 2, and resolution and performance improvements. The verdict is "certain details clearly need attending to by Nintendo".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For arcade-perfect accuracy in the likes of F-Zero GX, the extra input latency on Switch 2 should ideally be addressed, and likewise the sensitivity of those analogue sticks, the pattern of single frame drops in all games is also an obvious blemish but fundamentally the four games released on the GameCube classics page so far are faithfully represented."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows a video from game developer and YouTuber Modern Vintage Gamer about GameCube games on the Switch 2 – summing up the initial experience as "very good" but also having some "obvious" differences from the real experience.</p>
<p>To access this latest Switch Classics library, you'll need to have access to a Switch 2 and an active Expansion membership.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/efa52e229e64b/super-mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's looking like it'll be a hot one this weekend, and while gaming may not be the first thing that comes to mind, you know we're all going to need some time chilling in the shade at some point.</p>
<p>Before we get into this week's What Are You Playing, let's recap the major news from the past seven days. The biggie was a tasty slice of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> info from a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">IGN</a> interview, where we learnt the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">director and producer</a>, its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-like-mario-kart-world-was-initially-planned-for-switch-1">Switch 1 origins</a>, and how the team got its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dk-bananza-devs-needed-to-know-more-about-donkey-kong-so-they-went-to-miyamoto">DK inspiration</a>. Only one week to go!</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was revealed that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">Switch Game Voucher scheme</a> will be wrapping up next year, we interrogated everyone's experiences with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-how-are-your-download-speeds-on-switch-2">Switch 2 download speeds</a>, shared our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/three-laps-two-players-one-vegas-jumpsuit-10-things-wed-love-to-see-added-to-mario-kart-world">wishes</a>, and witnessed the birth of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/crocs-launching-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing-out-next-month">Animal Crossing X Crocs collaboration</a> (insert cheers/boos here).</p>
<p>We also found time to review <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/misc-a-tiny-tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-air-combat-221">Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/missile-command-delta">Missile Command Delta</a>. <em>Phew</em>, we need a lie down after that.</p>
<p>Now then, let's have a look at what everyone's up to this weekend.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:184756,184745 @ 1752396764 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>It’s all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> this weekend. A few caveats aside, playing this collection was like that moment when Anton Ego tastes the ratatouille and is mentally transported back to his childhood. Wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>I’m keen to play a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>. Most of the time, when I’m done reviewing a game, it kinda just gets left on the dusty, digital shelf never to be played again, but there’s something about this game that keeps bringing me back. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm on a retro buzz this weekend. I've still got the Wii set up after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a> bender I went on a few months back, and I've been meaning to blast through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/batman_the_brave_and_the_bold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a> with the kids. With the DC vibes in the air at the moment, it seems like a perfect time. I also want to show them GameCube <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_jungle_beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> with the bongos, and once they're in bed, I've got half a mind to fire up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/sin_and_punishment_star_successor">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a>, a game I picked up in the last few years but didn't get around to playing properly.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>By the time you're reading this, folks, I'll be trekking up through the gorgeous hills and paths of the Isle of Skye. Not the most relaxing holiday, but maybe the most beautiful? I'll report back in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So, not much game time! But on the train rides from London, Edinburgh, and back to the south, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> is my trusty friend. Will I ever play anything else again? Well... you know what's coming next week. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Felix Sanchez, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This weekend, I intend to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trials_and_tribulations">Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations</a>! I'm at the last case, so I'm excited to see how it all wraps up after some brilliant cases in this third game.</p>
<p>I'm also probably gonna be playing some Mario Kart World, and practising some of the courses in time trials with my brother. And if I'm really feeling it, I'll free roam a bit around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which has piqued my interest with the Switch 2 edition.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still cracking on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, polishing off a few more Moons before my mind goes bananas next week, and it is <em>still</em> wonderful. It's been eight years, but I still have a little giggle every time I see Mario take control of a photo-realistic dinosaur, and I don't think I'll ever stop.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd like to squeeze in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon</a> to relive some of my PSP days and remind myself why it's taken me the best part of 20 years to get those damn chants out of my head.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Kamurochō is on fire as I step into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> Chapter 13. However, I made the silly mistake of making an avatar for the 30 fps World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. I was not expecting to be so hooked on this mode and will continue Chapter 8 as a mix-and-match of special moves and clothing accessories. The throwback lore of the series is delicious, I’ve even found a Final Fight arcade in an alley and fought Retsu from the original Street Fighter!</p>
<p>Super happy to be wrong about the western eShop availability of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_super_dimension_fortress_macross_ii">Arcade Archives Super Dimension Fortress MACROSS II</a>, which will ensure my arcade stick will see action over the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> is also super fun! I'll make sure to make some progress on that front as well, before everything inevitably goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> next week.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wilmot_works_it_out">Wilmot Works It Out</a>. I do like it when I have one VERY DRAMATIC game with EXTREMELY HIGH STAKES and another one that's more like "this frog needs to make a cup of tea!" Wilmot Works It Out was fantastic for calming my nerves on a plane journey after one cancellation and three delays, whereas Hundred Line is the second-slowest burn game I've played (after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_in_fata_morgana_dreams_of_the_revenants_edition">House in Fata Morgana</a>). It has a lot of lulls in-between story beats. But that's okay! I think it's about to blow up big time, anyway...</p>

<p>Launching in Japan this month</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef273953df9f5/ys-x-proud-nordics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nihon Falcom, NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2's packing a lot more horsepower than the original system, and as a result, a lot of games and series can now ship with higher resolutions and improved performance. With this in mind, the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> will apparently support up to 120fps on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>This information comes from Japanese outlet <a href="https://s.inside-games.jp/article/2025/07/11/169368.html">Inside Games (via RPG Site)</a>, with the source reporting there'll be a special mode to prioritise performance, where players can apparently experience "smoother movements" thanks to the higher frame rate. The default performance is said to be 60fps.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is scheduled to launch on the Switch in Japan at the end of this month and is an "upgraded version" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> including new story, settings and more. If we hear any significant updates or anything about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This follows the release of Ys X: Nordics locally last October on the Switch, with a demo also available on the eShop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it!</p>
<p>Bash through just about anything with the raw power of Donkey Kong! Crash through walls, carve tunnels with your fists, punch straight down into the ground, and even tear off chunks of terrain to swing around and throw in groundbreaking exploration—the more you smash, the more areas open up for you to move through.</p>
<p>Join DK and his companion, Pauline, as they delve deep underground—and discover that this subterranean world is a lot more than it seems on the surface. Uncover a variety of environments such as arid canyons, lush forests, and frigid tundra as you peel back the world’s layers!</p>
