<figure><a title="The Plucky Squire - Challenge Update" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e585a0ce5fce0/the-plucky-squire-challenge-update.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Devolver Digital</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're sure that many of you will have played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plucky_squire">The Plucky Squire</a> when it arrived on Switch last year, but did you find the whole thing a little... easy? Well, the next free update from developer All Possible Futures sounds particularly designed for you (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-too-easy-for-you-the-developer-heard-you-and-said-challenge-accepted">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>The fittingly-named 'Challenge Update' arrived on Steam last week, and will be coming to consoles "soon". As you might expect, this one is all about upping the difficulty, and it throws in two new game modes to ensure it does so. 'Challenge Mode' introduces tougher enemies and a greater level of challenge, while 'Iron Squire' leaves poor Jot with just one life and no second chances — <em>eesh</em>.</p>
<p>On top of that, the new update will add new enemy types, and make some tweaks to the retro-inspired minigames for an extra slice of, you guessed it, <em>challenge</em>.</p>
<p>All Possible Futures announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thepluckysquire.bsky.social/post/3lsjn2npg4c2d">BlueSky</a> that these additions come alongside "several other features and tweaks" in the update, including select page layout changes and the chance to fast-forward through dialogue scenes.</p>
<p>We had a perfectly pleasant time with The Plucky Squire last year, but felt that its performance let it down. From our tests, things are running substantially better on Switch 2, though some hiccups remain. Hey, the Challenge Update could be the perfect opportunity to dive back in, whenever it comes our way.</p>

<p>It leaves Early Access in August</p>

<figure><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b7b4f535aa56/the-rogue-prince-of-persia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft and Evil Empire's roguelike take on Prince of Persia may well be coming to Switch, if a new rating in Australia is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Spotted by Gematsu and shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lssklr5nbk2d">on Bluesky</a>, <strong>The Rogue Prince of Persia</strong> was rated for Switch (and other consoles) on 27th June 2025, which you can see on the <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rogue-prince-persia">Australian Government website</a>.</p>
<p>Developed by Evil Empire, best known for co-developing the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a>, The Rogue Prince of Persia was announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/prince-of-persia-roguelite-from-dead-cells-dev-revealed-switch-not-confirmed">back in April 2024</a> as an Early Access title, and it arrived on 14th May. It's received a number of updates over the past 14 months, and the full release is due in August 2025 for Steam.</p>

<p>Perhaps those console versions could come at the same time? Of course, we can't be certain until Ubisoft itself makes that announcement, but it seems likely.</p>
<p>The 1.0 update will add more biomes, enemies, bosses, interactions, and the final third of the story. Meanwhile, the most recent update only landed last month, and brought more powerful builds and tweaks to the combat an traversal. You can have a look at it in motion below.</p>

<p>Another console port first</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hamster, known for its suite of retro <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> ports, has revealed its next Switch 2 game as part of the Arcade Archives 2 series. And, just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, it's another polygonal arcade-to-home port. This time around, it's <strong>Air Combat 22</strong>, which is coming to both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Switch 1</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_2_air_combat_22">Switch 2</a> on <strong>3rd July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/06/namcos-air-combat-22-is-coming-to-arcade-archives-on-ps4-ps5-switch-and-xbox">Time Extension</a> (via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/46058">Famitsu</a>), Air Combat 22 is an arcade game from 1995 and a spin-off of the original 1993 <strong>Air Combat</strong> arcade game. These games would eventually become part of what we know as the <strong>Ace Combat</strong> series, which actually celebrates its 30th anniversary <em>today</em> (for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/air_combat">console port of the original</a>, at least).</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version comes in at <strong>$14.99</strong>, with the Switch 2 one priced at <strong>$16.99</strong>. And, those of you who don't have a Switch 2 yet, you'll be able to buy an upgrade pack when you eventually upsize for <strong>$2.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Both versions of the game come with "Original Mode", "High Score Mode", and "Caravan Mode", but the Arcade Archives 2 version (for Switch 2) will also get a resolution bump and additional modes such as "Time Attack" (not Network Mode though, as this is a single player game).</p>

<p>Air Combat 22 was a step-up in nearly every way to its predecessor. Named for running on the Super System 22 hardware, the game let you choose form one of three aircrafts — Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Sukhoi Su-27 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor</p>
<p>Notably, this is the first time that Air Combat 22 has ever received a console port, so it's fantastic that we're finally getting it in a more-accessible format. And if the Ridge Racer Switch 2 version is anything to go by, you're in for a treat.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get more Ace Combat love on Switch 2, especially after the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7</a> port.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Until Then (Switch) - A Relatable Yet Ethereal Narrative Adventure]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/until-then</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Glitch in the Matrix</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a> is a visual novel that tells the story of Mark Borja, a high school student who grapples with the usual day-to-day of teenage life while trying to figure out why he’s experiencing weird cases of déjà vu. It’s a slow burn; one that relishes in the quieter, mundane aspects of life that many TV shows and movies would rather you believe didn’t exist.</p>
<p>With beautiful pixel art visuals at its heart, Until Then feels a lot more ‘alive’ than a lot of visual novels, with dialogue and actions taking place entirely within the scene; so in other words, no ‘talking head’ sequences where static characters are nattering to one another from across the screen.</p>
<p>There is a supernatural element that slowly reveals itself, but it’s best if I keep this under wraps here. This is a game that works best with as little prior knowledge as possible, and its story will definitely tug at your heartstrings on more than one occasion through its 10-15 hour runtime.</p>
<p>Gameplay is understandably pretty limited, and you’ll spend most of your time simply pressing ‘A’ to advance the dialogue. Occasionally, you’ll be able to move left or right through the environment, and developer Polychroma Games has also seen fit to include a bunch of fun little minigames. Again, these all fit into the narrative wonderfully, so one moment you might be trying to jam a stick into some floating fishballs, and the next you’ll be playing a tune on the piano. They're really cool and help to break up the experience nicely.</p>
<p>I have to give a massive shoutout to the sound design, too. A lot of the music is composed of slow, gentle melodies no doubt designed to heighten moments of emotion, but the true star of the show is the diegetic sound. Almost all of the public scenes are bolstered by background noises of folks just going about their day; it gives a wonderful sense of place, but also a weird, ethereal feeling to the bizarre events that play out.</p>
<p>While I do appreciate a slow burn, there were definitely a few scenes that outstayed their welcome. One in particular sees Mark simply trying to keep himself entertained at home: he watches TV, plays games, and even chats to random strangers on his phone. It demonstrates his boredom and loneliness well, but I think the same goal could have been accomplished a bit quicker. Mark's bored, but that doesn’t mean I need to be.</p>
<p>This is a minor gripe, though. Until Then is a wonderful story that manages to feel both strange and relatable, and it’s well worth playing. One quick note on the Switch 2, however: the game hasn’t been optimised for the new console yet, so after a certain point early on, it simply didn’t work for me. Stick to the Switch 1 for now.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/until-then]]></content:encoded>
