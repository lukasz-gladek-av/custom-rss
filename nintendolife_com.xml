<p>It was announced as a "fall 2025" release</p>

<p>In September, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone lifted the lid on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/stardew-valley-to-dig-up-mouse-controls-on-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of his farming and life sim. During the Nintendo Direct reveal, it was noted how this version would be <a href="https://youtu.be/8ac2-LRIAeU">arriving in "Fall 2025"</a>. We're now just weeks out from the end of the year, so what's the status of it?</p>
<p>If you have been wondering where the Switch 2 version is (and the free upgrade for existing Switch players), apparently, there is going to be <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001155907833753682">"something" announced "very soon"</a>. Barone also apologised to fans for the wait – here's what he had to say on social media:</p><div><figure data-videoid="r3KMxc-vq0o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr3KMxc-vq0o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed35e359kglrjo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eric Barone:</strong> "I'll announce something very soon sorry about the long wait"</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="35d513d3163de"><a title="Stardew Valley" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35d513d3163de/stardew-valley.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ConcernedApe, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the game's anticipated 1.7 update, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409">the creator has now shared</a> details about some of the content fans can expect, and there's "lots more" planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed the original announcement, the Switch 2 Edition of Stardew Valley will come packed with mouse controls, four-player split-screen and eight-player online multiplayer. There'll also be GameShare support, so Switch and Switch 2 users without a copy of the game can join in on the fun.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, developers have been rolling out all sorts of upgrades for existing titles. With this in mind, the latest one announced is for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyblade_x_evobattle">Beyblade X: Evobattle</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/beyblade-x-evobattle-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Beyblade X: Evobattle - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> arrives in Japan today on <strong>18th December 2025</strong>. It is a 1,000 yen paid upgrade for existing Switch owners who purchase the "Upgrade Pack". Local pricing hasn't been announced just yet.</p>
<p>Like other Switch 2 Editions, this upgrade comes with higher resolution graphics and a higher frame rate. There'll also be faster load times (thanks, Gematsu).</p>
<p>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE was launched on the Switch eShop last month. Here's a bit more about it from the Nintendo website:</p>
<blockquote>

Experience thrilling high-speed Battles that demand skill and precision! Challenge Bladers around the world in online matches!</p>
<p>Evolution 2: EVOSTORY<br>
New allies await—compete, grow, and chase your dreams together in the ultimate BEY BATTLE ROYALE (BBR)!</p>
<p>Evolution 3: EVOCUSTOMIZE<br>
Customization reaches new heights! Collect materials to coat your Beys in your favorite colors, enhance your favorite parts, and choose X Skills to create the perfect Beys for your Battle style!</p>
