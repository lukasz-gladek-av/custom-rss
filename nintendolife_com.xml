<p>I HAVE THE POWER!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Limited Run Games and Mattel are teaming up with Bitmap Bureau to bring us a brand new pixel art side-scrolling He-Man game in 2026 on Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/he-man_and_the_masters_of_the_universe_dragon_pearl_of_destruction">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction</a> will feature 12 stages from the iconic toy line and cartoon where you'll be able to play as He-Man, Teela, Man-At-Arms, and a range of other favourites. Skeletor is the one you'll be taking on — eventually. Oh, and of course you can ride Battle Cat.</p>
<p>So, Bitmap, we have to ask — what's it like handling <em>two</em> iconic '80s icons with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D</a> and now He-Man?</p>

<p>The Masters of the Universe return to the gaming scene in 2026; physical and digital pre-orders will be coming early next year.</p>
<p><em>Are you looking forward to a new He-Man game? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>Frog wizard? We're in</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, and Supamonks have dropped a brand new trailer for their stunning beat 'em up roguelike mash-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/absolum">Absolum</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, the game is launching on Switch on <strong>9th October 2025</strong>. The news dropped during Gamescom's Opening Night Live pre-show, and the trailer has us desperate to play as the frog wizard. Give him to us!</p>
<p>Brome is his name, and he's the game's fourth playable character — a humanoid frog born with magical powers. he can use his staff in melee combat while using magic to attack groups of foes from afar. And... he can glide? Okay, sure.</p>
<p>In case you've missed anything and everything about Absolum, you'll be playing as one of four rebels who are attempting to stop the Sun King Azra from conquering the world after a cataclysmic event.</p>
<p>It's a side-scrolling action game with hand-drawn-esque visuals and plenty of combat options, and with every death, you get to start a new run over and over.</p>
<p>Intrigued? Check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-absolum-dead-cells-meets-streets-of-rage-4-in-an-effortlessly-stylish-rogue-em-up">our hands-on with the from earlier in the year</a>. And let us know if you plan on picking the game up on 9th October 2025.</p>
