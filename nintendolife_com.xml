<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f313d46b13da/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>It would come as no surprise to hear that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> is one of the most successful indie games of all time, right? An immensely popular Switch launch (a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/06/hollow_knight_sold_over_a_quarter_of_a_million_copies_on_switch_in_two_weeks">quarter of a million sales</a> in its first two weeks) and six years of waiting for one of the most hyped-up sequels ever is bound to do that. But it turns out that the melancholic metroidvania has sold even better than we expected.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellan stated that Hollow Knight has sold around <em>15 million copies</em> since it launched back in 2017. 2.8 million of these sales came before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> was announced in 2019, and an additional 12 million have come in the years since, the devs stated.</p>
<p>For reference, that puts Hollow Knight's sales numbers roughly in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> (which had amassed 14.83 million units sold by the last official count in 2023). Of course, not all of Hollow Knight's purchases will have come from Switch, but still, it's in line with a <em>Pokémon game</em>.</p>
<p>According to the Bloomberg feature, the game's continued success has meant that the team has been able to continue to work on Silksong without having to worry about finances. “We’re very lucky in that regard,” Gibson told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, “I don’t ever really think about it that much. Maybe that’s the privilege of it”.</p>
<p>Compare that to the development of Hollow Knight, where the team was reportedly living off leftover office sandwiches and the odd $20 top-up from parents, and it's plain to see just how far the studio has come between games.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed it, Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th September</strong>.</p>

<p>While the Switch 1 version goes MIA</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Amazon Games and Glowmade have announced that their hack-and-slash co-op party platformer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/king_of_meat">King of Meat</a>, will be heading to Switch 2 in "<strong>early 2026</strong>".</p>
<p>This one was initially announced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-every-nintendo-switch-game-reveal-and-trailer">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, and it even popped up in this year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">March Nintendo Direct</a> with a 2025 Switch 1 release window. That date wasn't meant to be, clearly, and it looks like the console might not have been either. While the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series have landed 7th October release dates, and the Switch 2 has been given a rough window, we've been told that there's no more information on a Switch 1 release for the moment. So, keep holding out hope for that one... we guess.</p>
<p>But enough pessimism — a Switch 2 release is good news! King of Meat is all about silliness, tasking you and a group of three other pals to make your way through a series of developer- and community-created dungeons in the hopes of racking up fame in front of a live studio audience.</p>
<p>There's a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque energy to the puzzle platforming, and a decent arsenal of weapons and upgrades to make the hacky, slashy combat feel nice to pull off.</p>

<p>Amazon Games has announced that a King of Meat Technical Test will be taking place on PS5, Xbox Series and Steam from 23rd-24th August at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST / 7pm CET, to check that everything is running as it should and open the floor to player feedback. This won't be available on Switch 2, but it hopefully means that things should be in tip-top condition by the time that it comes our way.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-king-of-meat-fun-and-foolish-hack-and-slash-with-a-side-of-mario-maker">hands-on</a> with the PC build of King of Meat last year and had a perfectly fun time with it — despite our worries that the Switch 1 wouldn't be able to keep up with everything happening on screen. Assuming that the Switch 2 fares a little better, this could provide some pleasant party platforming next year.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cff408fab2636/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Team Cherry has finally lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">release date</a>. It's <strong>4th September</strong>, if you missed it, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier has sat down with the devs to find out why it has taken so long to make.</p>
<p>The short answer, as detailed in Schreier's feature (paywalled), is that the team has simply been having a nice time making it. The ideas kept piling up, and a pesky little global pandemic pushed things back somewhat, but it sounds like Team Cherry has been maintaining a healthy attitude to the whole thing for the past seven years — which, in the grand scheme of high-profile development stories, is rather lovely to hear.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067muiyon&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Despite spending this much time with the massively-hyped sequel, it seems that Team Cherry already has ideas for <em>more</em> content to add to the game. "Launching it is obviously quite exciting," the studio's co-founder William Pellen told Bloomberg, “What comes after for us is equally as exciting”.</p>
<p>"The most interesting thing now is what we can add to it next," Team Cherry's other co-founder, Ari Gibson, agreed, even teasing that the team has "got a plan" for what these additions might look like. "Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well," Gibson continued, "but hopefully we can achieve some of it”.</p>

<p>And it sounds like the team could have kept going for many more years than the six it's been since Silksong was announced. "It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping," Pellen commented, "We could have kept going”. Gibson even stated that he "had to stop sketching" at some point, to avoid a situation where that game takes "15 years to finish". Heh, it makes six years of waiting sound like child's play, no?</p>
<p>The devs also shared with Bloomberg why their updates have been so few and far between in recent years, with Gibson stating that “We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing, because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it’”. Pellen sang to the same tune, affirming, “Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game” — not that they expected things to take this long, of course.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg feature</a> is full of other details about the game's development besides those mentioned above, and is well worth a read if, like us, you've been wondering what's been happening over at Team Cherry in recent years.</p>
<p>There are just two weeks to go now until we all finally get our hands on Hollow Knight: Silksong, and based on our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/video-at-last-weve-played-hollow-knight-silksong-on-switch-2">Gamescom hands-on preview</a>, it's looking extremely promising.</p>
