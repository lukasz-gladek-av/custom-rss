            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="61ffe6b0cd8e7"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61ffe6b0cd8e7/nintendo-switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the introduction of the OLED model, there's been an Ethernet port built into the dock of Nintendo's flagship Switch, and that continued this year with Switch 2. If you're after the fastest download speeds or you play competitive online games while docked to your TV, you may benefit from wiring up your dock to your router directly.</p>
<p>However, since launch back in June, we've seen reports of players having issues with wired internet connections. Some point to the Realtek port as the culprit, others think it's a specific firmware or software glitch, or a USB-C-related handshake issue where something periodically goes awry. But whatever the reason, there seems to be a group for whom Switch 2's Ethernet port just isn't functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Asking around the NL office, it's blank faces, (un)fortunately. Either a wireless connection is sufficient and we haven't ever bothered wiring up the dock, or we just haven't experienced any issues.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/ethernet_port_on_switch_2_docks_failing_for_many_people">our forums</a> and <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/some-switch-2-ethernet-docks-are-malfunctioning.14103/">the wider internet</a> are filled with people who have had issues. Some have sent their docks back to Nintendo with varying degrees of success; others have found that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l6q47u/comment/n1rse3p">connecting their phones via a USB cable</a> somehow resets the chip and managed to get their Ethernet back up and running, if only temporarily.</p>

<p>Naturally, Nintendo has its error codes and <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68592">related pages</a>, but assuming that using a different Ethernet cable doesn't solve your problem, opening up a report ticket with Nintendo is the only option they're offering.</p>
<p>Obviously, this issue will be frustrating if it impacts you, but we're keen to get a sense of just how many people this is affecting. As with any electronic device, there'll be a percentage of failures or manufacturing faults that crop up that'll need attention, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">10.36 million people</a> (and counting) picking up a Switch 2 in the first few months, there are bound to be some malfunctioning units - but how widespread is the problem?</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll below if you've experienced any issues with a wired internet connection - and if / how you've solved the problem.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1752ef6450e0d"><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1752ef6450e0d/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you can turn your attention away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> for one moment, it seems we might have the very first leak from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>The Legend of Zelda Movie</strong></a> set.</p>
<p>While very little has been revealed about the film so far, it was confirmed earlier this month that the live-action is officially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">"in production" in New Zealand</a>. Now, in an update this week, footage has supposedly emerged of the production, including some clips featuring cast members and the film crew.</p>
<p>This is where this rumour possibly enters <strong>spoiler territory</strong>, so if you don't want any surprises ahead of official updates, navigate away from this page now. Right, with the spoiler warning out of the way, the first video that's been uploaded on Instagram shows two characters in a forest, surrounded by horses (with one horse equipped with some gear featuring what looks to be the Hylian Crest).</p>

<p>The first actor is believed to be Bo Bragason as Zelda, who is dressed in an outfit that looks similar to her clothing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, and the second actor (who we haven't heard about up until now) is apparently the Aussie and Tibetan actress Dichen Lachman, known for her current role in the Apple TV+ exclusive, Severance. She's also previously worked with director Wes Ball on Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.</p>
<p>As for who she is playing? Based on the footage, fans are already convinced she'll be Impa. Long-time Zelda players will know Impa is a recurring character in the Zelda series, who has been depicted as the bodyguard and mentor of the Princess.</p>
<p>The second scene doing the rounds looks to feature an older version of the series' protagonist Link in his green tunic, which he has appeared in across multiple games, including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess</a>. The footage in this upload even shows him putting on a cloak, and some fans think his horse Epona is also on display in the other clip.</p>

<p>We'd be surprised if the original clips stay up if they are the real deal. Of course, for now, it's probably best to treat this supposed leak as a rumour, but we will say the footage certainly looks the part, and casting someone from across the ditch (<em>aka Australia</em>) would check out, given the location of the production.</p>
<p>Apart from Zelda's casting, the only other actor officially confirmed for the Legend of Zelda Movie is Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. As for the story, some basic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">descriptions have popped up online</a>, but that's about it. This live-action film is currently scheduled to arrive in cinemas in <strong>May 2027</strong>, and you can find out more about it in our guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>After 60 hours, I am still maining BALL x PIT. I had a peek into the leaderboards, and have got dragged into those! 😆 Am in the top 30 for the first two levels. It is fun watching the chaos as you get stronger and stronger, and I would like to see how far things can be pushed. So Absolum and Trails In The Sky will have to wait for now! Have a great weekend, guys, and please take great care of yourselves out there!</p></section>

<p>I finally beat Star Wars Outlaws during the week! I still have a ton of side content to explore, but after pouring in 60-70 hours into it, I feel like I can break from it for now. I really enjoyed this on the Switch 2, which means I'm in the market for a new Switch 2 game! Trying to wait for the holiday season to see if Cyberpunk goes on sale, or any other games I have on my wishlist.</p><p>In the meantime, I started Paper Mario TTYD, wish I never played previously. Actually, its my first Paper Mario game. Ive been enjoying it so far, and could be primer for my eventual playthrough of Xenoblade Chronicles X.</p><p>No ROG Ally X games at the moment that have hooked me. Played a little bit of Kingdom Hearts, but there seems to be some game issues specific to the ROG, so I bounced off of that, and I played a little Quantum Break, which I enjoyed a bit more, but I didn't feel in the mood for a game like that right now.</p></section>

<p>I'm a few hours into Lunar 1 and will try to beat it before Octopath Traveler 0 releases in december. Played through the prologue demo and i'm really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Last couple of days i finally got hooked into Hades 2. Played it every once in a while since it released but put it on the side for other games. Things are opening up and incantations brewing.</p>
<p>Currently transfering games to my PS2 HDD so i might also play some Chulip or Conflict Desert Storm</p>

<p>That's funny, last week I actually started replaying <strong>Resident Evil 5</strong> as well, for the first time since I played it back on the PS3 around when the Gold edition released. This time however I'm playing it on online co-op with a friend, the co-op experience is making the game so much better. We're already in the tribal area, hopefully we can get some more game time this weekend.</p>
<p>For my main solo playthrough I'm replaying <strong>Fire Emblem Fates Conquest</strong>, I have my share of issues with the game but I'm quite enjoying the intricately designed maps and trying out some characters which I never really gave the time of day to, most notably Odin who I understand has redeemed himself in a big way in the game's later years, the simple act of getting him a Nosferatu tome turns him from a low damage liability into a tank. I've made it through into the midgame, just got Xander in the last map and the main characters have for the most part been rounded up, next up should be the absolute nightmare that is the Ninja dungeon chapter, I'm both looking and not looking forward to that.</p>

<p>I have been playing Oracle of Ages for the first time, through NSO, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I've needed some help with a couple of dungeon puzzles, as my puzzle solving abilities have waned, as has my patience for them, but that's alright. In the past I'd be annoyed at myself for using guides, not any more... I'm looking forward to playing Seasons next. I have read that's more combat focused.</p>
<p>The classic filter for the GB/ GBC games looks very nice. Has that recently been improved as I don't remember it looking as nice as that before?</p>

<p>On Switch:</p>
<p><strong><u>The Legend of Zelda</u></strong><br>
Completed the sixth dungeon. Currently at 14 hearts.</p>
<hr>
<p>On other platforms:</p>
<p><strong><u>1000xRESIST</u></strong><br>
Completed Chapter 2.</p>
<p><strong><u>Assassin's Creed Shadows</u></strong><br>
Just assassinated the second Onryo with Naoe and completed Amagasaki Castle. Currently level 9. I'm usually a massive AC fan but not feeling it with Shadows just yet. The inability to control the day/night cycle is also annoying AF.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Eduard_Brenton" data-username="Eduard_Brenton" rel="nofollow">@Eduard_Brenton</a> Which Shinobi, the Sega Ages version? Love it, I've spent far more hours with that than one would expect to spend with the original Shinobi. I like playing for a high score, trying to get through a stage without using Shurikens for the bonus points at the end. It's rock hard to do though.</p></section>

<p>I just played through RE5 last month on Switch 1. It performed well enough there but I tried out Mercenaries mode on Switch 2 and wow... MUCH smoother! I am now playing RE6. The framerate really tanks on Switch 1 so I am playing this one exclusively on Switch 2. It runs like a dream there.</p></section>

<p>This weekend feels like a turning point in my gaming year. I finally closed the book on my playthrough of Hogwarts Legacy, ending at 96% completion and 145 hours. It was the right place to stop. I didn’t want to burn out on a world I had come to love so deeply. And Professor Weasley’s “well done, indeed” upon reviewing my Field Guide progress was all the validation I needed. A marvelous journey, start to finish. Here’s hoping for the eventual release of the planned sequel on Switch 2 in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>In happier surprises, Hello Kitty Island Adventure dropped its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade without warning, and I bought the $9.99 upgrade instantly. The game looks noticeably crisper and runs more smoothly on the newer hardware, even if the occasional stutter still intrudes. Mostly I’m thrilled that the Hello Kitty rug in Dear Daniel’s apartment has finally stopped flickering in and out of the astral plane. A blessing.</p><p>I’m heading to Miami Beach for the next several days, so my gaming will match the setting. I plan to revisit Donkey Kong Bananza and give it another chance, now that I’m in the right mindset for something tropical and energetic. The same thing happened with me and Super Mario Odyssey years ago. I bounced off at first, came back later, realized how brilliant it was, and chased down every Power Moon in sight (and not in sight). I’m hoping Bananza will click in the same way.</p><p>Happy gaming, everyone!</p></section>

<p>This weekend has brought a few more hybrid ports backlog boosters to consider in terms of storage juggling and session inclusions, from No Place Like Home, Necrosmith and Spells &amp; Secrets to Loop8, Dragon: Marked for Death and Trinity Trigger... wait, scratch that, it was <strong>supposed</strong> to bring all these before eShop seemingly went south with payment processing last night, registering free grabs like the new Azuma/SoS DLC as usual but yielding error messages upon any attempt to add funds or even try changing the long saved payment card - which, incidentally, has led to bloat- er, boosting my Deck backlog with Ys 1/2 and Planet Centauri instead as a test of the same card's general functionality and potential bank hijinks. Seeing as two spare accounts on both sides of the pond (hailing way back to when I still used that approach for region-exclusive games instead of adjusting the main acc's country) are also failing to add the card info, I can narrow this nuisance down to the Ninty side but all the dedicated help pages and social media posts offer nothing more tangible than "keep trying your luck later".🙄😆</p>
<p>What's a nerd to do during the allocatable gaming time, then? Sink into the already amassed stuff that was always in the cards besides anything new, of course. Xillia and Graces, Yumia and Marie, Persona 4 and 5, Xenoblades and Castlevanias galore, aforementioned Azuma and other sim RPGs like Portia/Deadcraft/Harvestella, recently initiated playthroughs like Ball x Pit, Tinkertown or Railgrade and the long ongoing ones like Puyo Puyo Tetris, Saints Row 4 or Borderlands 2... all of that with possible intermissions on other platforms, be it Cyberpunk and Chibi-Robo on NS2, Payback and Fallout 3 on Deck (I'll have to see of I can cram Planet Centauri in, but Adol will certainly have to wait until I'm done with Ys Origin), Gravity Rush and Valentia on the handheld consoles, Phantom X and Resonance Solstice on the phone... so, not counting the aforelamented but hopefully fleeting FWPs, business as usual.</p>

<p>TOTK. It didn’t appeal to me at all when it first came out; the assembly mechanic, the massive open world, it just seemed too much game and I wanted something more contained. For no particular reason, a couple of months ago I changed my tune and jumped in, and boy oh boy, I’m glad I did. What a masterpiece. I know I’m preaching to the choir here, but in case there’s one more human being out there who needs convincing, this is an experience not to be missed.</p></section>

<p>Think I’m close to finishing Tiny Lands 2 which has been excellent, hoping this will receive DLC like the first game. Next up I’m aiming to try the Octopath Traveler 0 demo which may lead me to the full game and another time sponge… Happy gaming all!</p></section>

<p>I’m going to be playing move furniture back into my living room and my daughter’s room after finishing painting and installing floors. I threw my sofa away, so when I do hook my consoles back up… I have nowhere to sit. I will be playing “search for a new sofa” after that. I’d like to say I’ll be settling down to play Yotei, but I don’t quite know if I’ll have time. All I can guarantee is that, in the absence of having my console games to play while I move stuff, Balatro on my phone will say hi.</p></section>

<p>Before I get to what I'll be playing this weekend, I have to mention that after putting Silksong down for a month due to The Last Judge, I came back to it on my day off to myself and I FINALLY beat it. I just needed a couple of important tools to do it (if anyone is struggling, get the Tacks and the Threepin. They work wonders, so you can mostly focus on fighting without the use of them adding too much to think about. I just threw all my tacks on the ground and spammed my pins at the end. Combined with poison, and they saved my soul on this fight). It felt SO good to take down after all of that time. The thought of thay fight haunted me for a month while I switched to playing Crow Country and Steamworld Heist II instead.</p><p>With that in mind, I think Silksong will be something I pick at on the side while I play a main game. Right now, I'm on episode 4 of Heretic (from the Heretic + Hexen pack). I never got to try this one out, and even though its very similar to Doom (just with magic spells instead of weapons), I'm having a blast with it. I might even try starting up Ninja Gaiden Ragebound this weekend, since I'll be wrapping up Heretic soon.</p></section>

<p>This weekend my time is spent obsessing on <strong>Hades 2</strong>. I played this quite a bit when it released on the Switch, but I got burned out during the 20-hour mark and took a lengthy break. I’m now 50+ hours deep and won’t be pausing any time soon.</p>
<p>It may sound embarrassing, but I have yet to complete a single run, but I’m okay with that due to its rich story strong narrative and characters. It’s truly astonishing that this game can have so much content. I’ve yet to encounter a single repeated line of dialogue between character interactions, and each person is fully developed, with excellent voice acting to provide an extra layer of immersion.</p>
<p>To simply put, Hades 2 is easily going into my pantheon of exceptional games, possibly in the top five. I’m not sure how Supergiant exceeded expectations, but they are a master of their craft. Every game they make is top tier, and better than the last. I can’t wait to see their next project. Until then, welcome to the GoTY discussion my indie darling.</p>
<p>And I’m now patiently waiting for one of my most anticipated games in years: <strong>Demonschool</strong>. Only a few more days to go.</p>

<p>I'm just continuing to be fascinated and amazed playing stuff at 300fps. I decided to try out my old laptop with this cheap new 300hz monitor I bought and was amazed that it can run Lossless Scaling perfectly. I've been having endless trouble getting LS to work on my new laptop. I wonder if it's Windows 11 vs 10. I've never allowed the "upgrade" on my old laptop, and now I'm planning to protect it from any updates at all. I don't want to lose this ability to get emulation, videos, and all games up to 300fps with perfect frame pacing!! People talk about diminishing returns on higher frame rates, and they're right, but at the same time I'm amazed and enthralled by higher and higher fps. Playing Utopia Must Fall at 300fps and getting the triple shot for the first time, and realizing I can widen or narrow the triple shot with the triggers, well it just looks like a beyond perfect light show! I've gotten up to 16 days survived and something like 210,000 high score. I Love Utopia Must Fall.<br>I'm also playing Dirt Rally at 300fps. Once I destroy all the settings and lower the resolution to 720p (probably my favorite resolution!) it can run at 300 to 400fps, and it looks gorgeous!<br>Also playing Lonely Mountains Downhill (such an amazing and relaxing game), Pru the Pigeon, wipeout 2097 phantom edition (I'll always want to play this at 300fps!), Retro Endurance 8 bit (so grateful the dev programmed this to run at 300, or whatever you've got!), Rush Rally Origins, Classic Mario World 3 the finale, Super Mario World Redone 40 Years of Mario!, Zelda's Adventure DX, and Rocket League.<br>Oh, and I'm super excited to get a Gabecube, Steam Controller, and Frame! I love that the Gabecube can output very high frame rates via Display Port — I'll be using that feature!!<br>And I've enjoyed all the content online. Linus' love struck face cracks me up! I'm excited for the coming expansion of the "open ecosystem"!<br>I also liked Alana Pearce's reporting on Saudi and Kushner investments in EA and games in general (Nintendo too!).<br>I wish everyone well, and happy gaming!</p></section>

<p>This week we’ve moved from playing on the Switch 2 to SteamOS. I installed it on my Mini PC (Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT) after the Steam Box announcement. Running SteamOS is a better gaming TV experience with the only drawback being using the shop on controller can be awful.</p><p>We were sick of our Switch 2 crashing while playing Vampire Survivors. Some folks report no issues on Switch 2 but we’ve had multiple crashes a day and performance after 20 mins in a run is pathetic. It’s sad to see new hardware performance so badly.</p><p>As for Vampire Survivors, we’ve done everything but the adventure modes now.</p></section>

<p>As its mid November, going back to Batman: Arkham Origins on PS3, I think I preferred his one to Knight despite it not being part of the 'trilogy'. The Christmas setting in the city still has great atmosphere, even on PS3 I still think it looks good. Also as I'm using the console, have to play some classic Daytona USA.</p>
<p>Even more retro wise, I picked up the new DLC for Atari 50 on Switch, playing 2600 Dig Dug after all these years is still fun, and very nostalgic.</p>

<p>Probably fire up the Gamecube and give F-Zero GX and Star Fox Adventures a whirl. Might also start a fresh playthrough of Odallus on Switch, dont remember actually finishing it a few years ago. Enjoy your weekend everyone!</p></section>

<p>Traveling to Japan, and was thinking of bringing the Switch to continue Dragon Quest II, but in a stroke of brilliance I dusted off my 2DS XL and Dragon Quest VIII for the flight.</p>
<p>Very curious to see how Street Pass fares in 2025.</p>

<p>Outside of my twice a year "test older game systems and see if they still work" session today - which usually involves firing up a game or two from each system library if the machine functions - I'm still working on <strong>Pokemon Scarlet</strong> with an occasional side order of <strong>Hades</strong> on Switch. I've reached Area Zero in the former and LOVE the group dynamic, character development, and increasing unease in this area. And the <em>music</em>....The area theme is hands down my favorite track in the game. I'm still doing the occasional run through the Underworld in the latter, but I'll admit the game is starting to feel more repetitive. I've at least cleared the final boss once but would like to finish the main story. Which means more escape attempts.</p>
<p>There's a last hurrah of sunny mid 70 degrees F/~25 degrees C weather both yesterday and today in my corner of the US, so I might get outside for a bit too. It was glorious on my lunch trail speed walk yesterday.</p>
<p>Happy gaming!</p>

<p>Happy weekend and gaming everyone. This week I have been playing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure"><strong>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</strong></a> - I caved in and got the Switch 2 edition upgrade for $10. The game looked sharper for a few minutes but then my brain adjusted and I can no longer tell the difference. 😝 Not worth the upgrade, but oh well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kirbys_dream_buffet"><strong>Kirby's Dream Buffet</strong></a> - The recent Nintendo Music release reminded me that I hadn't unlocked everything in this game so I have been playing again. Such a fun little game. I wish multiplayer was active, but it's still fun to play around against the bots now and then.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/klonoa_phantasy_reverie_series"><strong>KLONOA Phantasy Reverie Series</strong></a> - The recent Switch 2 OS update finally fixed this game! I'm restarting the first game in the collection. It looks really good on Switch 2 now that it doesn't instantly crash!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition"><strong>NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</strong></a> - I got this game for a few dollars earlier this year and was waiting for it to be fixed on Switch 2 to play it. I decided to just start. If it breaks I'll swap to Switch 1 😅</li>

<p>I’ve got limited time to play this weekend because the Spearess and I need to be awake at 2 a.m. Monday to fly to the happy island of Aruba. Still a lot of prep to do before that.</p><p>For those keeping score at home, I easily won my <strong>Civ VI</strong> run as Tsar Peter of Russia very early last weekend, gaining victory by making our founded religion — Rastafari, of course — the dominant religion in every other civilization, the highlight being when Babylon was converted. Jah bless.</p><p>I promised myself I wouldn’t start another run because I didn’t want it occupying my mind while I was on vacation, but then I went ahead and began a run anyway as Pericles leading Greece. I stepped up in difficulty, and it has been a struggle. So, I will indeed have that on my mind next week!</p><p>And … happy gaming, everyone!</p></section>

<p>I'll be playing Pokemon Legends ZA and La Pucelle. Been playing these for the past few weeks. I'm loving how Legends ZA makes things much simpler to do in shiny hunting and training up Pokemon stats making you have more fun actually playing the game than doing time consuming tasks.</p></section>

<p>Been playing some Distance on the PS5. It’s a sort of racing game with a slight horror edge to it. Real fun. On Switch 2 I just wrapped up Chicken Police: Into the Hive so that opens up for more Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment.</p></section>

<p>Finished Kirby and the Forgotten Land. There are fun great moments but then there are some stages that tend to be overly long but the gameplay is too repetitive for that, so it tends to drag. It's also kinda too easy, only the true final boss poses any real challenge. But abilities are awesome, and it has a variety of neat little things to do which I like. And it managed to sate my hunger for a platformer lol</p><p>And I also started up Tales of Graces F. Been wanting to play this one forever and it does not disappoint. Absolutely love the characters and the dialogue. Story starts off pretty troupey but there's never a dull moment yet at least. And the style of the game is gorgeous</p></section>

<p>I'm a broken record as of late. My gaming time has been way less lately than I'd like. Damn personal life. In-laws are in the stage where they need more and more help with errands like grocery shopping, doctor appointments and whatever odds &amp; ends throughout the week (and especially any days off). Taking up more and more of the wife and mine's time.</p><p>Anyways, back on topic when I can game I'll just keep the tunnel vision on <strong>Hades 2</strong> (Switch 2) and <strong>Snowrunner</strong> (Switch 2). Between those two I have no time to squeeze anything else in at the moment.</p></section>

<p>I just rolled through the <span title="Warning: Spoiler!">Olympian family reunion</span> after over a hundred runs with <strong>Hades</strong>. My max heat level was 11 with the blade, although I think I'm fine giving it a bit of a rest for now. <strong>Hades II</strong> being released was the swift kick to the rear I needed to finally go tackle that.</p>
<p>Still very early in <strong>Star Ocean: Second Story R</strong>,, which looks a lot nice in motion that it does in stills. I've also got some <strong>Cities: Skylines</strong> planned out. Lots of school this weekend. And I may yet sleep!</p>
<p>Happy gaming everyone!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Ganner" data-username="Ganner" rel="nofollow">@Ganner</a> Hey, Ganner, I feel you. I've been using a lot of my days off to help the folks with doctors' visits. But the way I look at it, when I was a kid my dad spent so many days off dealing with Little League and other activities for me, so I'm just paying it back. And my dad was a firefighter, so I'm sure he needed the days off much more than I need them now. (It's tough, though, when these games have their claws in you, right?)</p>

<p>Speaking of Resident Evil, the new Switch 2 update breaks progression in the game, making it unplayable on Switch 2. Basically camera will crash and start vibrating in place, with no way to unlock it. You xan still hear what's going on, but you won't see what's happening, because the frames don't advance to the next action. This happens at many points in the game, so no matter where you are in the story, it will eventually stop you from progressing.</p></section>

Vexx level 39.</li><li>The King of Fighters XIII Global Match (Switch): Completed Arcade Mode with the Psycho Soldier Team and the Women Fighters Team. Also, completed 3 Combo Trials with Goro.</li><li>Fate Stay Night Remastered (Switch): Reached Day I-After school/Daily life (I).</li><li>Witch on the Holy Night (Switch): Reached Chapter 5 Night of the Witches 1.</li></ul><p>Happy weekend &amp; gaming everyone!</p></section>
