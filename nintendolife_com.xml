<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eaea1e2008977/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all waited a whopping seven years to get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and what has been <em>the</em> talking point in the weeks following its release? The difficulty.</p>
<p>With tricky bosses, perilous platforming and some meaty runbacks, many have found Silksong to be a touch too tricky at launch — even after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-upcoming-patch-will-nerf-the-difficulty-in-certain-areas">swift update</a> sought to lessen the blow of select early encounters — and now, Team Cherry has addressed the hot topic in a recent discussion at an ACMI Game Worlds exhibition in Australia (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zmolit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
<p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>834k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>"Silksong has moments of steep difficulty," Team Cherry's Ari Gibson told the exhibition's co-creator Jini Maxwell, "but part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you're going and what you're doing".</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson continued. "One player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes".</p>
<p>This approach makes a lot of sense. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, there <em>is</em> help to be found with Silksong's trickier moments, if you know where to look. If a boss battle or particular platforming challenge isn't working out for you, then the best idea is probably to get back to exploring for a while.</p>
<p>The goal is to prevent players "getting stonewalled" by a particular challenge, Gibson stated, so the team ensured that "[players] have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely".</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6837e9297f134/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't to say that all challenges can be overcome by mere exploration alone, mind you. "Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight," Gibson said of the core changes in the sequel, "so even the base enemies had to be more complicated, more intelligent".</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of these core enemies borrowed from the original Hollow Knight to really sell the step up in challenge. "The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss," revealed Team Cherry's William Pellen, "in contrast to the Knight's enemies, Hornet's enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away".</p>
<p>It's brutal and punishing at times, but that didn't stop us from having a <em>wonderful</em> time with Silksong. We called the long-awaited sequel "a mesmeric blend of balletic combat and movement with persistence, joy, and an incredibly invigorating map at the centre" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 10/10 review</a>, which you can read in full below.</p>

<p>If we build them, they will run</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Asobism's tower defence/roguelite/factory sim title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shapehero-factory">ShapeHero Factory</a>, releases on Switch 2 (and 1) today. Hooray!</p>
<p>For anyone unfamiliar, this one sees you create an army of robots from a bunch of magical shapes within a factory setting, making for a sweat-inducing puzzle of sorts as you work to get your automation processes up and running before battle.</p>
<p>The twist? You don't actually get to control the robots you make in the ensuing fight here. Nope, it's all about the factory, levelling up through artefacts and creating more and more powerful units to keep on, er, powering through.</p>
<p>Here's some further — and much more official — details and screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mass-Produce Heroes<br></strong>Transport basic shapes from the scroll to assemble your heroes with different combinations. Circles with triangles will make soldiers, while circles and squares make sprites. Add squares to soldiers to give them shields. Perhaps you could create stronger heroes by combining soldiers together…</p>
<p><strong>Hold the Gates<br></strong>The Great Calamity lies deep within the Book of Magic. To bar your heroes from invading, his forces will come to demolish your gates. Maintain the defense while you forge ever deeper into the book. The servants of The Great Calamity each has its own method of attack, so you must choose the right hero for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Factory-Building and Roguelite Elements Make For Endless Possibilities<br></strong>Obtain rewards from a randomly generated list of options after winning battles.<br>
Will you unlock new artifacts (facilities), or upgrade your existing ones?<br>
As you continue making these tricky decisions, you will create a wholly unique factory!<br>
The choices that each author (playable character) will face as well as the types of heroes that they can create are different, so you need to challenge a different “factory-building” each time you play.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to Grow Stronger<br></strong>The enemies are powerful. With the experience points gained at the end of the game, players can use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to grow permanently stronger. This means that the more you play the game, the stronger you will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game left Early Access and went live with version 1.0 just yesterday over on Steam, where it's got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2389040/ShapeHero_Factory/">688 "Very Positive" reviews</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>ShapeHero Factory is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shapehero-factory-switch/">available from the Nintendo eShop for $23.99</a>, or whatever that equates to where you are. It's out on Switch 1, too, for the same price. According to Nintendo's game page, there's no specific upgrade pass for the Switch 1 version (and saves aren't transferable between them). HOWEVER:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the release date, players who own the Nintendo Switch version of this title will be able to obtain the Nintendo Switch 2 version free of charge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to argue with that! We're having trouble finding specific details on what the Switch 2 version does above and beyond Switch 1 - better frame rate and resolution, you'd imagine, especially as the game page suggests a ~400MB file size increase on Switch 2. We'll update you with any details we find out.</p>
