<figure data-uuid="0f68a75aaf501"><a title="Yuji Horii Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f68a75aaf501/yuji-horii-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=mare07-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Shogakukan</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Masahiro Sakurai's game knowledge was extended to yet another medium when the game developer extraordinaire's life was translated into a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sakurai-is-getting-his-very-own-manga-biography">manga biography</a>. Why do we bring this up now, you might ask? Well, because <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> creator Yuji Horii will soon get the same treatment (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/manga-detailing-the-life-of-dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-in-educational-rpg-style-to-release-on-february-24/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Unofficially titled '<strong>Dragon Quest Creator Yuji Horii: New Educational Manga Biography</strong>' (translated by Automaton), the manga is supposedly a semi-dramatised retelling of the developer's life, predominantly focusing on his Dragon Quest work — no surprises there, then. Its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=nlife0b-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon listing</a> even suggests that it'll frame the story as an RPG itself, with Horii-san recruiting people to his 'party' and 'levelling up' with new skills.</p>
<p>The manga is being published by Shogakukan, with illustrations by Iori Makoto, and it'll feature an interview with Horii-san himself at the end. While no official English translation has been announced at the time of writing, the book is set to launch in Japan on <strong>24th February</strong> for 1,210 yen (roughly £6/$8).</p>
<p>We can't take a peek at the manga's contents just yet, but here's a closer look at the cover art:</p>
<figure data-uuid="dc61910ccbb0e"><a title="Yuji Horii Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc61910ccbb0e/yuji-horii-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=mare07-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Shogakukan</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This will be the latest game developer to join Shogakukan's biography series. Back in 2018, the publisher released a similar deep dive on Pokémon's Satoshi Tajiri, all about the founding of <em>another</em> hugely popular RPG series. Who will be next, we wonder?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I’d like to talk about Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>It has received high ratings, scoring over 80 on Metascore at “Metacritic” and earning an "Overwhelmingly Positive*1" rating on Steam's customer reviews. We recently announced that worldwide cumulative sales have surpassed 1 million units. However, initial performance did not meet our expectations, and we are aiming to sell approximately another 1 million units within this fiscal year. We aim to sustain long-term sales by encouraging players to enjoy the game over time through the continued support of the title including ongoing release of additional downloadable content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega notes that its overall performance in the first half of the current fiscal year has been somewhat disappointing, citing lower-than-expected sales in the gaming division along with Rovio's performance in the entertainment sector.</p>
<p>The presentation highlights <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</a> as a major full game release for the fiscal year, but we suspect it will probably want a few more big-hitters as the wider industry grapples with uncertain economies and price hikes across the board.</p>
