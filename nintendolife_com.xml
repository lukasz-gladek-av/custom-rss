            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nitrome's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> made a bit of a splash when it was revealed back around the Switch 2's launch, looking very much, as it does, a sort of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/snipperclips_plus_cut_it_out_together">Snipperclips</a> for Switch 2 that utilises the console's neat mouse mode function.</p>
<p>Now, Nitrome has released a second trailer for their mouse-mode-centric effort, alongside a bunch of new info about the ins and outs of what you'll be doing as you play- when you do actually get to play, that is.</p>
<p>The new trailer takes us through three job types, and shows off the game's Job Centre. The jobs detailed are Hairdresser, Archer and Tour Guide, so this is definitely already a much more interesting job centre than the ones this writer remembers being harrowed by during the late 1990s.</p>

<p>We'll let Nitrome's press release fill you in on a little more of the finer points:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In Hairdresser, you’ll work against the clock to give your hirsute customers the trim of their dreams. Click with your scissors to cut away at their hair, or use the razor to give them a close shave - and we couldn’t not add tweezers, right?</p><p>

Next up is Archer, where your aim will be put to the test. Hit all the targets as they fly past (quack), and don’t miss any, or else you’ll lose a life! Be sure not to hit your coworkers, too...</p></div>
<p>Tour Guide takes a fresh spin on a Nitrome classic - Hot Air! Propel your tourist through the stage to reach the goal, but be sure to visit landmarks along the way to take in the view and earn your tip. We’ve worked hard to ensure Tour Guide stays true to its roots (it was even programmed by one of the Hot Air series’ developers!)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
You can check out the trailer above for yourself, it's certainly looking like a whole bunch of fun, and this new glimpse also makes sure to highlight some important changes to the game's multiplayer.</p>
<p>"In Cargo Hauler, some crates will simply be too heavy to lift by a single mouse, or in IT Support, some popups will trap a player inside them - you’ll need a colleague to come over and close that popup before you can escape!"</p>
<p>Now, and on a slightly frustrating note, Nitrome, whilst fully ready to release by the looks and sounds of it, will have to wait to announce a release date for all this mouse-drive mayhem, as they have yet to receive a Switch 2 dev kit from the Big N.</p>
<div><p>As we reported on a while back, it seems that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">this is par for the course at this stage of a new console launch</a>, with indies that require extra grunt perhaps getting kits first. It still feels a bit odd that Nintendo aren't keen to make sure these sorts of titles, which big-up the new features of a new console, are first in line for kits, mind.</p><p>

As Nitrome puts it:</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Mouse Work’s release is dependant on Nitrome acquiring dev kits for Switch 2 which we do not yet have. That being said, we are working away to get Mouse Work as ready as possible so that when we do have one, we can release as soon as we can!<em><br></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll leave you with some fresh screenshots!</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to getting some new job experience when Mouse Work manages to release? Like the look of what you've seen of the game thus far? Make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91bf859864489/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already know the Switch 2 has broken sales records in the US — just last month, Nintendo's upgraded hybrid console reportedly hit an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">"all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware"</a>. And now, Circana's Mat Piscatella has more data to back up that info.</p>
<p>Sharing the stats on Bluesky, not only is the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in the US <em>ever</em>, but the launch also helped boost video game spending in the US to an all-time June high.</p>
<p>Spending on industry products increased by 22% in June 2025 compared to last year, which is a huge boost. And while the year's overall spending is still slightly behind 2024's (just by 2%), things are looking up thanks to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Originally, we knew the console had sold 1.1 million units in its opening week, but by the month's end, that climbed to 1.6 million units. As a reminder, we know the console has sold over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days</a>, so with the extra 5 million, console sales are already over 4 million.</p>
<p>Hardware spending has increased by 249% compared to last June — to $978 million — another record-setting month for sales, surpassing the previous record of $608 million in June 2008.</p>

<p>In terms of game sales, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was the third best-selling game of the month, right behind Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Elden Ring: Nightreign. However, Nintendo doesn't include digital sales in this data, so if we had to guess, Mario Kart World is <em>possibly</em> number one. Digital sales have boomed in recent years, after all.</p>
<p>In terms of Nintendo games, the Switch 2's line-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a> all made the top ten, with other titles that got free Switch 2 upgrades or paid Switch 2 Editions also making up most of the rest of the list.</p>
<p>There's no stopping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, though!</p>

<p>So, the Switch 2 is doing incredibly well, then! We'll likely hear more on sales figures at Nintendo's next financial briefing, which is due in August.</p>
