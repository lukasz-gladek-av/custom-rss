<p>NIS anchors another Game-Key Card release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>NIS America is bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> to Switch 2 in the West in <strong>early 2026</strong>, the publisher has announced. But, like its other Switch 2 releases in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, it'll be a Game-Key Card (as per the <a href="https://eustore.nisaeurope.com/products/ys-x-proud-nordics-deluxe-edition-nintendo-switch-2">store listing</a>).</p>
<p>Now, if you're confused and thinking that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X</a> is already out on Switch, you're not wrong — this is an expanded version of the 2023 (2024 in the West) action RPG. Proud Nordics has been out in Japan since 25th July, so we won't have to wait too long.</p>
<p>As well as being a Switch 2 release, meaning there will be a bump in performance and visuals, Proud Nordics adds additional quality-of-life improvements, new mechanics, and new challenges.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw is Öland Island, a brand new map that "seamlessly" adds in new story elements to the game. So it's a much more expanded rerelease than just a 'bump', from the sounds of it.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game from NIS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience Adol and Karja's unforgettable journey across Obelia Gulf with new quality of life improvements, then discover the new story centering around Öland Island, and the mysterious newcomers Canute and Astrid. And once you're ready, challenge yourself in the devious, time-trial dungeon of Muspelheim, where every second counts. Your new adventure awaits!</p>
<p>As the definitive edition of this critically acclaimed entry in the <em>Ys</em> series, <em>Ys X: Proud Nordics</em> offers all of the fast-paced combat and enthralling narrative of the original release, with new mechanics, a high-difficulty dungeon, and a brand-new storyline seamlessly integrated throughout the game.</p>
<p>After a tense encounter at sea, the young red-haired adventurer Adol and the proud Norman Karja find themselves bound together by shackles of Mana, and by the looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr, who seek to pillage the vibrant Obelia Gulf. Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ys-x-nordics">were fans of the original Switch version</a>, despite some issues with the sailing — and we've seen online from those who've played the Japanese release that the boat mechanics have been tweaked in Proud Nordics. So if you haven't yet picked up the game on Switch, maybe hold out for this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Turtle beach airline fit review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb5e60739e4cb/turtle-beach-airline-fit-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Between everyone at Nintendo Life, we've already got quite the heady (thanks) collection of gaming headsets for Switch 2 since the new console launched. You can find our in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-gaming-headsets">Best Nintendo Switch 2 Gaming Headsets</a> guide.</p>
<p>However, one thing that we don't have a whole lot of choice on, and especially if you're looking for any sort of reasonable level of quality, is a decent budget offering. Until now!</p>
<p>Turtle Beach, who I'm certain you're all familiar with, has just launched its <a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/airlite-fit-wired-gaming-headset-nintendo-switch-2?Color=Charcoal+Black">Turtle Beach Airlite Fit</a> for Switch 2, a headset that's priced at <strong>£19.99 / $27.99</strong> (although I've already seen it out and about and selling for brand new at £15 on the UK high street, so keep your eyes peeled for bargains if you're interested).</p>
<p>So it's about as budget as you'd really expect, or want, to go with this sort of gear, but does it work well? Is it worth a punt or not? Well, yes. Yes it is. It isn't going to blow your socks off, or your eardrums, which is fair enough at this price, but it is well-made, stylish, <em>and</em> fully officially licensed and branded. I would say it's a really nice shout for kids also. My eight-year-old can wear it comfortably, and so can I. Sorted.</p>
<p>In terms of build quality, the design, as you can see from our pics, is robust and does a good job of making the whole thing feel sturdy and comfortable on your head. There are no thin or easily breakable parts, it's all housed in one solid unit, and the foam strip under the headband keeps things comfy whilst the actual ear-pads are decent. I'm not a huge fan of fully-enclosed headsets like this by default, as they get too warm for me with my big old ears stuffed into those foamy cups, but these ones are fine for the most part; comfy, with no surprises — and the jersey-knit covering feels soft but durable.</p>
<p>To adjust the size, you can move the headband through several satisfying clicks on the appropriately-coloured left and right sides, and again this all feels much more robust than you might expect. The mic is surrounded by a soft rubber cover, and can be adjusted to sit as you like it on its little multi-directional wand. And, for the price, the sound quality of the mic is perfectly adequate.</p>

<p>And "adequate" is how I'd describe the entire aural experience, to be honest. You don't have all the latest tech and modes and fancy stuff here, but the 40mm speakers ensure bass is decent, holding its own in gunfights and explosions without getting muffled or distorted (my usual issue with cheap headsets), and the overall sound levels out of the box (no you can't adjust anything outside of what the Switch 2 console already allows itself), do just fine across the board.</p>
<p>It follows that there are no fancy ways to connect here, either. It's wired via audio-jack or bust, but that's fine. I expect all of this at this price point.</p>
<p>My only major gripe with this headset is that its volume doesn't turn up loud enough. Of course, this is going to vary based on how loud you like things, but maxing out the audio dial on the headset left me wanting more. To be clear, it's nowhere near too low, we don't have that issue at all, but it lacks punch and the top-out volume for me is about 25% too low for what I prefer.</p>

<p>And to make that volume change, there's just the one big chunky dial to consider, and to mute your mic you simply lift it up until it clicks into place. Again, nothing fancy, but this makes for a clean design, as there aren't buttons and lights and things to accidentally press everywhere. Silver linings! At 228g it's super light on the head, too.</p>
<p>All that said, Turtle Beach has given us a very sturdy, tidy and nicely designed budget headset. It 100% isn't going to set the world alight, but that's not its point, as the sound here gets the job done. Where it elevates itself beyond other budget sets for me is in its official branding and stylish shaping, which really does give off the air of a more expensive set of cans. It's also a really good option for kids, as the robustness ensures they won't break it after just ten minutes.</p>
<p>Judged purely on its sound quality and features, this is a very solid headset that gets done what's needed. Throw in the better-than-expected design, and that budget-price point and, for folks looking a bargain buy, the Airlite Fit for Switch 2 creep up into highly recommended territory.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f313d46b13da/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>It would come as no surprise to hear that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> is one of the most successful indie games of all time, right? An immensely popular Switch launch (a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/06/hollow_knight_sold_over_a_quarter_of_a_million_copies_on_switch_in_two_weeks">quarter of a million sales</a> in its first two weeks) and six years of waiting for one of the most hyped-up sequels ever is bound to do that. But it turns out that the melancholic metroidvania has sold even better than we expected.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellan stated that Hollow Knight has sold around <em>15 million copies</em> since it launched back in 2017. 2.8 million of these sales came before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> was announced in 2019, and an additional 12 million have come in the years since, the devs stated.</p>
<p>For reference, that puts Hollow Knight's sales numbers roughly in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> (which had amassed 14.83 million units sold by the last official count in 2023). Of course, not all of Hollow Knight's purchases will have come from Switch, but still, it's in line with a <em>Pokémon game</em>.</p>
<p>According to the Bloomberg feature, the game's continued success has meant that the team has been able to continue to work on Silksong without having to worry about finances. “We’re very lucky in that regard,” Gibson told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, “I don’t ever really think about it that much. Maybe that’s the privilege of it”.</p>
<p>Compare that to the development of Hollow Knight, where the team was reportedly living off leftover office sandwiches and the odd $20 top-up from parents, and it's plain to see just how far the studio has come between games.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed it, Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th September</strong>.</p>
