            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've seen our fair share of Pikachu plushies over the years (it's only one of the most recognisable faces in media <em>ever</em>, after all), but few have been quite as lifelike as this.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wow! Stuff and RealFX unveiled their latest creation: the Pikachu Puppetronic. As that name suggests, this is a puppet with a traditional hand-controlled design, combined with a fair amount of electronics for even more movement and expression.</p>
<p>We're talking dual-motion ears, blinking eyes, light-up cheeks, a moving mouth, and sensors all over its head, body and neck, so it can react to your touch. Throw in "over 120 sounds and actions", and this is probably as close as you can come to having ol' anime Pika in your home.</p>
<p>Naturally, it doesn't come cheap. The first wave of pre-orders went up on <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/72-11257-101/pikachu-puppetronic-by-real-fx">the Pokémon Center UK website</a> yesterday for <strong>£89.99</strong> and almost immediately sold out. Admittedly, there may have been a rush on these thanks to the inclusion of a special "First Edition" badge and certificate to up the FOMO, but we wouldn't be surprised to see folks clamouring for these for a while yet.</p>

<p>It's all very sweet, but there's a bit of us that finds the puppet a little... freaky. There's something about the blinking eyes, the vacant expression, and the promise that it can move on its own that pushes things closer to the uncanny valley than we'd like. A cute plushie, we can deal with, but one that might open its mouth and blurt out a "Pika Pi" in the middle of the night? *<em>gulp</em>*</p>
<p>The puppetronic is expected to ship in mid-spring 2026, so keep an eye out for restocks in the coming months, if this looks up your street.</p>

<p>"We have nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles"</p>

<figure data-uuid="015b8a88187d1"><a title="Pokemon LeafGreen GBA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/015b8a88187d1/pokemon-leafgreen-gba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The news that the GBA Gen 1 refreshes, Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen, are coming to Switch next week has gotten us excited this morning, but it's also raised some questions with fans.</p>
<p>How come these games aren't coming to Nintendo Switch Online like the other GBA games in the Expansion Pack? Will I be able to trade? Will we be seeing more Virtual Console-style releases like this?</p>
<p>Well, preempting all those questions, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71365/#s1q4">Nintendo of America has put out a FAQ</a> answering all those and more.</p>
<p>On the question of why these GBA games are being handled differently from others available on NSO, the article says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also addressed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>"</em><em>Online play is not supported."</em></strong></li>
<li><em><strong>"The games will not receive physical releases"</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>"We have nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles"</strong></em> (re. whether Red, Blue, or other Pokémon games may come to NSO in the future)</li>
<li><em><strong>"We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online"</strong></em> (re. whether further standalone retro releases are planned)</li>
<li><em><strong>"We thought users will appreciate the ultimate versions of those original adventures"</strong></em> (re. why these aren't the OG Game Boy versions)</li>
</ul>
<p>On other pages beyond this FAQ, <strong>support for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a> is confirmed</strong> to be on the way, and <strong>these games won't work with NSO Save Data Cloud backup</strong>. <em>[Update: The mentions of upcoming Home compatibility seem to have been removed from the game listings (thanks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/serebii.bsky.social/post/3mfc2n5errk2e">Serebii</a>). We've reached out to TPC for comment.]</em></p>
<p>We'll reproduce the entire FAQ below for your perusal:</p>

</ul>
<hr>

<p>So, it seems NOA tried to head the big questions off at the pass.</p>
<p>With the games priced at £16.99 / $19.99 each, and with all those separately listed language variants opening further possibilities for confusion, it seems wise to answer the biggest head-scratchers before a barrage of clarification requests from press and fans alike. The language version thing, in particular, seems more complicated than necessary, but hey, we'd expect no less.</p>
<p><em>Has NOA answered your main questions here? Let us know below if you're looking forward to a return trip to Kanto on Switch next week.</em></p>

It's a cause for celebration, of course, but there's a part of us that can't help but feel a pang of envy after realising that Japan is getting treated to a '<a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/switch-frlg/lineup/">Special Edition</a>' physical release, too.</p>
<p>We use "physical" hesitantly there, because it seems that this boxed release is still reliant on its included download code if you actually want to, you know, play the game. That said, it's a beauty.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fyqgwrl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The Special Edition includes two reproductions of the original Japanese GBA cases, and a rather swanky trio of laser-engraved glass balls with Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle inside. Putting these balls on their respective stand in the included display case, lets them light up in a fitting green/red/blue hue. <em>Oof</em>.</p>


<p>This release will be available from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html">Japanese Pokémon Center online store</a> from <strong>Saturday, 28th February</strong>. Both the FireRed and LeafGreen versions (the only difference being the contents of the download code) will set you back <strong>19,800 yen</strong> — which is roughly <strong>£95 / $127</strong>, <em>gulp</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this is a Japan-only release, with TPC saying that it <em>might</em> be available at physical Pokémon Centers at a later date. So... still Japan-only. Hey, let's keep those fingers crossed for a Western launch at some point down the line, eh?</p>
