<p>Confirmed in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/29/3122984/0/en/Atari-enters-into-an-agreement-to-invest-in-Thunderful-Group-AB.html">press release</a>, Atari will become the majority owner of the company, which was founded in 2017 and was essentially a merger between Image &amp; Form, Zoink, and Rising Star Games. It will acquire around 82% of the outstanding shares at approximately €4.5 million.</p>
<p>The Swedish Securities Council has granted Atari an exception to complete the transaction without needing to bid for the remaining shares.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This news comes just after <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update">Thunderful Group announced</a> that it would be restructuring the company to "improve operative cash flow", as the company is operating at a deficit.</p>
<p>Its most-recent release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random_the_eternal_die">Lost In Random: The Eternal Die</a> — which only launched last month — has "shown weaker sales than expected". CEO Martin Walfisz <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-martin-walfisz-to-leave-the-role-as-ceo-of-thunderful-group-ab">will also be stepping down from his role</a> by the end of the calendar year.</p>

<p>Thunderful went through a restructuring twice in 2024, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/thunderful-announces-its-second-restructuring-program-in-one-year">second as recently as November 2024</a>. Its newest SteamWorld game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_heist_ii">SteamWorld Heist II</a>, reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/new-steamworld-game-sales-fell-slightly-short-of-thunderfuls-expectations">fell slightly short of expectations</a>. Thunderful just announced it was bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> to Switch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/acclaimed-puzzler-viewfinder-bends-reality-on-switch-this-winter">later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Atari has made a number of fruitful acquisitions over the past few years, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/atari-enters-agreement-to-acquire-night-dive-studios">Nightdive Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/atari-acquires-retro-specialist-digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a>. With Thunderful's woes over the past few years, <em>hopefully</em> this will turn out as well as these two seem to have.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/nintendo-eshop-planned-maintenance-leads-to-further-imminent-direct-hype-1579413/">Gamereactor</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_GB/index.html">Nintendo's Japanese website</a> has flagged eShop maintenance later this week — between 7:00 and 8:30am UK time — during which Switch 2 and Switch network services may be affected.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what it says on the webpage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future maintenance schedule<br></strong>[Affected Products/Services]<br>
Switch 2<br>
Switch<br>
<strong>Network Services<br></strong>Acquisition of stage information, etc.</p>

<p>Date and time From (approx.) Thursday, 31 July 2025 7:00 to Thursday, 31 July 2025 8:30.</p>

<p>This is fairly standard practice for the platform holder, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumours of a Nintendo Direct before the end of July</a> suggest there may be a link between this particular maintenance window and a yet-to-be-announced Direct broadcast.</p>
<p>The most recent maintenance occurred just this morning, coinciding with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-3-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">system updates</a> for Switch 1 and 2 and the addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to NSO - along with more blessed stability for the platforms. As we found out during the 3DS era, you can never have enough stability, right?</p>
<p>As ever, we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for announcements today and tomorrow. By most accounts, there's plenty of fodder out there for a Direct, whether it's a Partner Direct featuring the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-reportedly-announce-more-game-ports-for-other-platforms-soon">apparent Microsoft Switch 2 ports</a> that we've yet to get official word on, something involving the upcoming 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, or something more specialised and game-specific - a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> Direct anyone?...</p>
<p>Anyone?? Look, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-drag-x-drive-is-fantastic-but-is-it-destined-to-be-switch-2s-arms">we really liked what we played of it!</a></p>
