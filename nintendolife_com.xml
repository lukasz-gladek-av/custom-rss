<p>"Power up your holidays"</p>

<figure data-uuid="c61e3eec308ea"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c61e3eec308ea/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two new unlisted Switch 2 lifestyle commercials for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> have been spotted on Nintendo's official YouTube page. They're titled "Power Up Your Holidays", so we'll seemingly be seeing them in the lead up to the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Although these new trailers are only around 16 seconds each and spend a lot of that time focused on the player, they apparently include some <strong>spoilers</strong> about Samus' new adventure – so we would advise you navigate away from this page right now if you don't want to ruin any surprises for yourself.</p>
<p>Right, with this warning out of the way, you can see two bosses. One is called Xelios (a new "spherical" boss) and the other is known as Carvex (a "plant" boss which you might have already seen). We've taken screen captures, just in case Nintendo's trailers end up disappearing. You can see them at the bottom of these videos:</p>



<p>Nintendo has also ramped up its coverage of all-things Metroid this week with a bunch of <em>other</em> Metroid-related announcements. This includes the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II</a> soundtrack on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>, and also some promotion of the upcoming Metroid Prime 1-3 art book. Nintendo has added a new Metroid reward to the My Nintendo Store, too.</p>

<p>If you haven't been keeping a close eye on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales Of</a> series, Bandai Namco is reviving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia</a> as a remaster next week. So, what about <strong>Tales of Xillia 2</strong>?</p>
<p>According to a new Famitsu interview, series director Yusuke Tomizawa has mentioned how a remaster of the sequel is "still in progress" – it just hasn't been formally announced yet, and he promises to share more information as soon as possible (translations via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’re following an ‘announce and release what’s ready quickly’ approach. In that vein, <em>Xillia 2</em> [Remastered] is still in progress, which is why it hasn’t been announced. We will do our best to deliver updates as quickly as possible."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qjvoms&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the "next remastered title" in the fantasy role-playing series, the team can't "provide the specifics" just yet, but the announcement is planned to take place "relatively soon". It's also mentioned how there are "more than two titles" currently in progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The pace of releases depends on the planning and development status—it could speed up or slow down. But even so, we’re hoping to deliver the fans as many titles as possible, as quickly as possible.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tales of Xillia Remastered launches for Switch on 31st October 2025, and you can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tales-of-xillia-remastered-coming-this-october-confirmed-30fps-for-switch">find out more in the announcement post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> lands on the Switch 2 and Switch this December, and ahead of the long-awaited release, Nintendo is celebrating the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> series in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>It's now offering a special <strong>Metroid Desktop Metal Display</strong>, based on the original NES release. It's exclusive to Switch Online members in the US right now, will set you back 1000 Platinum Points (shipping fees apply) and is "available while supplies last". Here's the official rundown and product dimensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elevate your desk with the classic Metroid™ metal display—only for Nintendo Switch Online members!</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Display your passion for the iconic Metroid™ game with this exclusive metal desktop display, available to anyone with a paid Nintendo Switch Online membership. Featuring the classic original NES™ package art on a metal panel, this piece rests on a sleek black acrylic base etched with the My Nintendo logo. It's a stylish and nostalgic tribute for any fan or collector who's ventured through Zebes and faced the Space Pirates.</p>
<p>This product comes with a protective film on both sides. If you find the film is old or stubborn, gently warm it with a hair dryer to loosen the adhesive, then carefully peel it off. Please avoid overheating the metal surface. Also, be aware that the panel edges may be sharp—handle with care.</p>
<p>Panel: 5 in x 7.125 in<br>
Thickness: 1 mm<br>
