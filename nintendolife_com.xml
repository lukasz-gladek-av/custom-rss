Here's The Chance To Make Your Voice Heard 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af10206becfb1/what-are-the-100-best-nintendo-games-heres-the-chance-to-make-your-voice-heard-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been in this business for a <em>long</em> time, so when you're attempting to decide on what the 100 best games released on its consoles and handhelds are, it's little wonder that it's <em>quite</em> the challenge.</p>
<p>However, we've teamed up with our friends over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/">IGN</a> to do just that – and we're in the process of concocting a list of the best games ever released on Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>You may wonder how this list differs from the one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/top-100-best-nintendo-games-of-all-time">already on this site</a>, but the remit here is somewhat different; this collaborative ranking will include third-party games that are either Nintendo hardware exclusives or are synonymous with Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>"IGN and Nintendo Life have come together to build the definitive list of The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">says IGN's Simon Cardy</a>. "We'll be rolling that ranking out from Monday, November 10 to Friday, November 14, revealing 20 picks a day until one game is crowned Number One."</p>
<p>Be sure to check out IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">Nintendo Voice Chat</a> for a rundown of the selected games. Who knows? You might even spot a familiar face...</p>
<p>Before the final list is published, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">IGN is running a face-off campaign</a> that allows you to cast your votes and shape a separate, reader-curated list.</p>
<p>Ahead of the final list going live, why don't you make your voice heard by heading over to IGN and helping to determine the running order for this in a user-generated ranking – you might help get your favourite game to the top of the tree!</p>
