<figure data-uuid="58446a9d9d94d"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/58446a9d9d94d/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the introduction to <strong>Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun</strong>, Keza MacDonald makes a simple promise: over the course of the next 12 chapters, you'll read something you didn't already know.</p>
<p>It's the kind of gauntlet-laying that would have any self-respecting Nintendo fan click their knuckles and close their <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a> tab in a 'challenge accepted' kind of way. And yet, 250 pages later, I can honestly say that it rang true.</p>
<p>'Super Nintendo', to bring it down from its proper title, is the story of the company that we all know and love; it's also the story of us, humans, and how we play. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keza-macdonald">The Guardian</a>'s Video Games Editor and former Editor-in-Chief at <a href="https://kotaku.com/">Kotaku UK</a> compiles interviews with just about every Nintendo creative you can think of (and the ones you can't) to explain how some of the industry's most iconic series came to be, while also reflecting on why these series are important in wider culture.</p>
<p>It's comprehensive but never too dense, informative but approachable, and packed with an unwavering passion for Nintendo that I'd wager even the company's biggest detractors would find infectious. In short, if you want to learn about Nintendo, this is the book to do it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0cb0be378867c"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0cb0be378867c/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn't a chronological walkthrough from A to B. It starts with the toy manufacturing of the 1960s and '70s and ends with the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a>, but each game-focused chapter in between serves as a jumping-off point to explain something larger about the company as a whole.</p>
<p>A chapter on <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> delves into the early design processes of a little-known artist called Shigeru Miyamoto. A <strong>Metroid</strong> section also serves to dissect gender representation in both Nintendo games and the wider industry. <strong>Animal Crossing</strong> acts as a prime case study demonstrating Nintendo's habit of sticking with an idea until its audience finds it.</p>
<p>Be it the story of smash-hit successes like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>, or the company's more off-the-wall moments like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_01_variety_kit">LABO</a> (no, LABO wasn't just a fever dream), the book presents the House of Mario not as a company that's out of touch with competitors, but one that's always looking to what's next — even if 'next' is a cardboard piano.</p>
<p>The Nintendo fanboy in me always likes viewing the company in relation to the larger industry, and MacDonald does a nice job of balancing the micro details of game development with the bigger picture. There are plenty of places that you can look for deep dives into specific titles and their development, but Super Nintendo really shines in showcasing the personal touches.</p>
<figure data-uuid="801977e687d0a"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/801977e687d0a/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take the chapter on <strong>Kirby</strong>, which is used as a way into discussing the much-missed Satoru Iwata. It's a poignant and heartfelt tribute shining the light as much on Iwata the man as Iwata the designer — the corporate president, computer programmer, <em>and</em> gamer, to paraphrase his iconic introductory quote. By compiling words from Miyamoto, Itoi and others close to him (mainly from Hobonichi's wonderful book, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/book_review_ask_iwata_words_of_wisdom_from_satoru_iwata_nintendos_legendary_ceo">Ask Iwata</a>), MacDonald balances Iwata's commercial and personal impacts. It's fitting that the chapter ends on Miyamoto's memories of their late-night meals and shared sweets rather than impressive sales figures for Wii and DS.</p>
<p>The book is built on one of the most comprehensive collections of interviews that I've seen in a long time, many from MacDonald herself. The veteran journalist throws out tidbits from her chats with Miyamoto, Aonuma, Tezuka, and others, pulling from other works when she didn't have a chance to sit down with the creative in question. Super Nintendo threads each perspective together into a cohesive whole, and it feels like you're getting a peek behind the wizard's curtain, catching a glimpse of all the old developers turning wheels and flipping switches while the end result looks like magic from the outside.</p>
<p>There are lots of little inner-working nuggets peppered throughout the book, and I don't want to spoil them here, but it's exciting to hear some of the company's longest-serving designers talk anecdotally about their perceptions of select products long before they launched. Shinya Takahashi has a list of production credits as long as your arm, so reading about his pre-launch worries about the Switch, about how he wasn't fully on board with the appeal of the design until the first time he moved a prototype from docked to handheld, is fascinating.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e274940fbeaf4"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e274940fbeaf4/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well-worn tales of Miyamoto's Zelda inspiration stemming from his time exploring forests as a child are mixed with lesser-known details, like Koizumi confessing he designed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s splashy focus on the back of his memories of summer holidays spent by the water. You'll find a lot of these anecdotes elsewhere, but I highly doubt that you've read them all.</p>
<p>By threading them into the story of the company, Super Nintendo proves to be a very satisfying summary of a company that is ever-changing and ever-growing. If this book puts one thing above all others across, it's that Nintendo's sense of fun, and our sense of play, will forever be its most appealing feature.</p>

Ah yes, another dose of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>!</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has kicked off the year in relatively calm fashion, but before the mad Spring rush hits us, let's look at some eShop gems that are worth checking out. Yes, there are games other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizon</a> out there, we promise.</p>
<p>Here's how this works: same as ever, our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from January 2026 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rlszmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>It's been a surprisingly busy January in terms of news and releases — Animal Crossing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII</a>, two whole Directs on the <strong>Super</strong> <strong>Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> — but the eShop exclusives have been a little on the quieter side on the review front.</p>
<p>We do have a review-in-progress for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>, but there have been plenty of other games we just haven't managed to get around to: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/they-are-billions">They are Billions</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suika-game-planet">Suika Game Planet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/citadelum">Citadelum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a>... these are just a few, too!</p>
<p>Still, we have four games that made the cut this time around, all scoring 7/10 and above. That leaves one honourable mention, and then the top three:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/cassette-boy">7/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">3rd Place - GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>The Switch 2's more-powerful hardware has really opened the door for all types of sports and racing games to make the jump onto Nintendo's console, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> has pulled up at the starting line to help get the driving going.</p>
<p>January has been a pretty impressive month for technical ports, and GRID Legends is among the very best. 60fps is the way to go here, but there are multiple different graphics settings you can play around with in both handheld and docked. That's still a rarity on Switch 2 right now, and we hope GRID sets the standard for other developers.</p>
<p>Put all of that together, along with top-notch racing mechanics, and you've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">an excellent 8/10 racer</a> on your hands. Just maybe pull out the GameCube controller for this one.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">2nd Place - MIO: Memories in Orbit (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of great-looking games on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a> is already one of the most-stunning on the console, with a beautiful spaceship-like vessel adorned in pastels and scribbles and an eerie, ethereal atmosphere that helps carry you along the adventure.</p>
<p>The platforming in this Metroidvania can be tough-as-nails, but when you master the movement in this game, it's sublime. The combat doesn't always work for us, but everything else elevates MIO from being 'just another action platformer' into a beautiful one that will stick with us.</p>
<p>MIO is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">our second 8/10</a> in this top three, <em>just</em> beating out GRID in the votes game by one. Turns out a robot in space is faster than a car.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Dispatch (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>If you've been paying attention to gaming news and releases, then you probably saw this one coming — AdHoc's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> was the runaway winner this month, and with good reason: it's fantastic, and a true return-to-form for the Telltale-style of gameplay.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, as former Telltale devs worked on this superhero comedy caper, that goes everywhere from rude jokes to explicit moments, but even has plenty of touching scenes and a little bit of romance. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">censorship drama</a> might be sucking the air out of things at the moment, but take it from us — regardless of where you play Dispatch, you'll have a great time.</p>
<p>As both the victor and the highest-scoring game of the bunch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">with a 9/10</a>, Dispatch takes the top spot on the podium. Congrats, Robert Robertson and everyone at the Superhero Dispatch Network!</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-december-2025"><strong>&lt; Nintendo eShop Selects - December 2025</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-january-2026]]></content:encoded>
