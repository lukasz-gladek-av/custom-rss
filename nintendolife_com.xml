<p>Return of the Kong</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last week Donkey Kong returned to the world of 3D platforming over 25 years since his last fully-3D outing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK64</a> - and what a return it was!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> scored an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Jim's review</a>, and most of Team NL has spent this weekend having a smashing time catching up with DK, Diddy, Dixie, and (Void) co. in what Jimbo described as "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184766 @ 1753104648 -->
<p>At the time of writing, the game is enjoying "Universal Acclaim" with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/">Metascore of 90</a>, but now everyone has had their chance to go bananas with it, we're wondering if you concur. How would you rate DKB?</p>
<p>While many of you might have blasted through the entire game over the weekend, if you're anything like us your minecart will have gotten derailed by the countless distractions and doohickeys away from the critical path. If you haven't finished the game, no sweat - voting in the poll below doesn't mean your score has to stay the same.</p>
<p>Yes, you can come back at any time to either change your score or add one when you've settled on a rating from 1-10. If you've already rated the game in our database, thank you kindly - your score already counts! If not, feel free to drop your mark below and let's find out how Bananza measures up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-donkey-kong-games-of-all-time">DK's big bunch of other games</a>.</p>

<p>Now, fair warning, there will be mild spoilers ahead, so make sure not to ruin any of the fun for yourself if you'd prefer to find all this stuff yourself. With that said, let's take a look at the best nods to the series' history, and other tidbits, that we've dug up thus far. And please, make sure to let us know any easter eggs or little bits of trivia that <em>you've</em> found!</p>

<h3 id="side-scrolling-tribute-levels">Side-Scrolling Tribute Levels</h3>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza features a whole bunch of cool side-scrolling levels that pay homage to DK adventures of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Hilltop Layer's Nostalgia Country</strong> gives us our first blast of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> memories. Meanwhile the <strong>Resort Layer</strong> gives us a <strong>Mine Cart Country</strong> level, which of course also references those amazing sections in good old Donkey Kong Country</p>

<p>The <strong>Radiance Layer provides Arcade Country</strong>, a level designed around the 1981 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a> Arcade. And finally, <strong>Bramble Country, a bonus level found in the Forest Layer</strong>, gives Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest some sweet loving.</p>
<h3 id="rambi-returns-alongside-some-other-pals"><strong>Rambi Returns (alongside some other pals)</strong></h3>
<p>This layer packs in a <strong>Rambi Rumble</strong> game which, of course, directly references the level of the same name from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country_2_diddys_kong_quest">Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</a>. Not only do you get to ride Rambi again (hooray!), there's also the words Double Trouble splattered along the hoardings at the side of the rack track in this area. Heck, even Candy Kong gets a mention in this area.</p>

<h3 id="fossil-maps-depict-characters-from-across-the-series-history">Fossil Maps Depict Characters from across the series' history</h3>
<p>If you've been keeping an eye on the fossils you gather up, you'll likely have noticed that some of them reference characters from past DK games. Now, we're not gonna spoil them all here, but so far we've found what appears to be Tricky the Triceratops from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_racing">Donkey Kong Racing</a>, as well as Engarde the swordfish (Donkey Kong Country).</p>
<p>Besides these bigger characters, you've also got Banana Bird fossils, recognisably-shaped pigs and even a little DK fossil to be discovered along the way. Nice.</p>

<h3 id="paulines-lady-dress-and-diva-dress">Pauline's Lady Dress and Diva Dress</h3>
<p>Pauline has access to her diva dress from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> and her OG outfit from her first appearance back in the 1981 arcade game. The diva dress can be unlocked immediately <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-all-amiibo-unlocks">using the official DK Bananza amiibo</a>, but all of the dresses can also be picked up in-game!</p>

<h3 id="donkey-kongs-treehouse">Donkey Kong's Treehouse</h3>
<p>If you're anything like us, this will have been one of the first things you attempted to find. And you won't have been disappointed! Donkey Kong Country's iconic homestead appears in the Nostalgia Country level that you can find in Hilltop Layer.</p>

<p>Right at the start of this little tribute, turn back on yourself, as shown in our pics, and climb up to find DK's home in exactly the same way you'll have done in Donkey Kong Country. However, this time you'll find some sweet memories (and a banana). Oh, and feel free to smash the place to pieces on your way out. Cheers!</p>

<p>Motion sickness doing the rounds</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e39fb3e494d3f/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is out now, and it seems that the <em>vast</em> majority of people have been thoroughly enjoying DK's latest adventure on Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to some reports, however, it seems a small minority have been experiencing some pretty severe motion sickness with the game. This came to our attention via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1m1p5vm/playing_dk_bananza_atm_and_got_extremely_nauseous/">Reddit</a> thread in which user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vruchtenhagel/">vruchtenhagel</a> said that they "got extremely nauseous in the first 45 minutes".</p>
<p>The thread has since garnered over 250 comments, some from folks experiencing similar issues, and others kindly offering potential fixes to alleviate the effects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4lgtnzp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bgrandis7/">bgrandis7</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was looking for someone who had a similar experience to mine! I felt really, really sick in the first area as well, never had something like that happen to me before.</p>
<p>"I think the zooming in and out from 1st and 3rd person on Ingot Isle might be the culprits. I really hope the next areas are less cramped and the camera can be a bit further away."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-motion-sickness-settings/">Nintendo Everything</a>, you can try disabling the motion controls and screen shake via Bananza's options menu to potentially help with the problem. Some commenters in the Reddit thread have stated that such actions have unfortunately not helped, while others have said that it does indeed reduce the motion sickness.</p>
<p>So, we thought we'd put it to you fine folks and see if this really is a potential issue. Have you been feeling any motion sickness from Donkey Kong Bananza? Why not let us know by voting in the below poll and expounding with a comment while you're at it.</p>
