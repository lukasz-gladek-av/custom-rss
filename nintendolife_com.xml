<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fbfc6e72db97/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We know the Switch 2 has sold incredibly well worldwide, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">the console shifting 1.6 million units in June 2025 in the US alone</a>. Now we have an idea of just how well the pricey, but excellent, new Pro Controller has done, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> has shared Circana's estimated Switch 2 Pro Controller sales, and it's around 512,000 in the United States — that means around one in three people picking up a Switch 2 have also grabbed a shiny new controller to go with. That's around <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37t7z552k">a 32% attach rate</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a Nintendo fan, you'll know that the Pro Controller is one of the pricier controllers on the market right now, and is actually one of the accessories that went up in price in response to the Trump Administration's tariffs (or, as Nintendo put it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-us-pre-orders-start-24th-april-system-and-launch-game-pricing-unchanged">"changes in market conditions"</a>) — from $80 to $85.</p>

<p>The original Switch 1 Pro Controller is also compatible with the console, and that, coupled with the price of the new controller, has put some people off rushing to grab one , as good as it is.</p>
<p>We're also still in the very early days of the console's life, so those sales are likely going to dip over the coming months. Still, 32% is an impressive number, and we'll be interested to see how other accessories — such as the Camera — have sold.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Plenty of people are busy revisiting two of the Switch 1's greatest games — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> — on Switch 2. The frame a resolution boost are pretty remarkable in our eyes, and it seems like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-zelda-upgraded-on-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-tested">Digital Foundry agrees</a> with our assessment, calling the upgrades "transformative", especially for the 2023 sequel.</p>
<p>While the upgrades do cost a few pennies to pick up (though they are included in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription), Digital Foundry thinks it's "worth it" to see just how remarkable these upgraded titles look on the new console.</p>
<p>First up is dynamic resolution, which is available on Switch 1, but the Switch 2's version has a higher range in both games to support 4K displays.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12249eada6850/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where dynamic resolution targeted 1600x900 on Switch 1 while docked, the Switch 2 release boosts that to a maximum of 2560x1440. There are dips in extreme cases, but these are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry did spot a few moments where the frames dipped randomly during cutscenes for no obvious reasons, but quickly corrected itself. And while the resolution boost and improved textures are fantastic across the board, there's a distinct lack (or lack of effectiveness) of anti-aliasing in both games.</p>

<p>Improved load times (some of which are more than halved) and shadow quality are two other highlights the outlet was keen to point out, but we want to focus on the frame rate and performance.</p>
<p>Focusing on Tears of the Kingdom first, Digital Foundry confirms what we all know — the game is running at 60fps for the most part, and stays pretty consistently up in those figures whether you're in battle or using Ultrahand. Testing only the first 6 hours of the game, DF noticed one tiny blip when building vehicles. A huge improvement from our experiences on Switch 1.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93a8df22abe6f/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Breath of the Wild is even more consistent, with busier areas like Kakariko and Zora's Domain put under the test with exploding barrels. These stay at a rock solid 60fps now.</p>
<p>So, it's an impressive rundown, with a few little caveats. While "rough points" do remain in both games, these two upgrades come with an easy recommendation from the tech specialists.</p>
