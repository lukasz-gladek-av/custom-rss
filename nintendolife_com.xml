</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="High on Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7105afbc53043/high-on-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: via Nintendo / Squanch Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>There are many Nintendo fans around the globe currently making the move from the Switch to the Switch 2, and this process has been made slightly easier – with select games offering completely free upgrades.</p>
<p>The latest title to offer this is the mature-rated first-person shooter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/high_on_life">High On Life</a>. This game made its debut on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-download-1st-may-north-america">original Switch earlier this year in May</a>, and now just months later, the Switch 2 version has been released. If you don't already own the existing Nintendo version, you can purchase the title for $40.00 / £30.49 (or your regional equivalent).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iwqxht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>For anyone who already has this title sitting in their game library, you can get the Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack for free. This upgrade comes with not only Joy-Con 2 mouse controller support, but also other enhancements like updated textures, higher frame rate and enhanced resolution. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>High On Life: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack features:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Support for Joy-Con™ 2 mouse controls<br>

<hr>
<p>Again, this upgrade is a completely "free download" if you already own the existing Switch version. According to the official listing, the game file size is an estimated 28.1 GB on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Apart from this title, some other free upgrades have recently rolled out for third-party titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shadow_labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a>. Nintendo has also offered free upgrades for multiple first-party games on the Switch 2, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>. The update for these entries improved the frame rate and resolution, making the movement smoother and graphics clearer.</p>

<p>"The guild authorizes a special collaboration"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Recently, it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> content appearing in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and now Capcom is flipping this crossover around.</p>
<p>The developer will be bringing the hunt to its latest Street Fighter entry, dressing the fighters up with new EX colours, "new gears" and more. This limited-time event will be taking place between <strong>1st September 2025</strong> and <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about what exactly you can expect, and you can see it all in motion in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guild authorizes a special collaboration between Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest installments in both of these iconic franchises!</p>
<p>All players who log in during the event period will get special collab items! The Shop will also be stocked with special EX colors for Blanka, Akuma, Manon, Cammy, and Ken inspired by some wild creatures.</p>
<p>During this event, the Battle Hub will also get a new makeover while we run a special Street Voter event. Finally, the Monster Hunter 20th Anniversary Fighting Pass will return for the collab!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the game's online Battle Hub is also getting a themed makeover, and the 20th Anniversary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_rise_sunbreak">Monster Hunter</a> Fighter Pass will be making a return, so join in on the festivities while you can.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/street-fighter-6s-first-season-3-dlc-character-is-out-now-heres-a-look">recent release of the DLC fighter Sagat</a>, with multiple other characters also on the way as part of the Season 3 update. When we see and hear more about these additional fighters joining the roster, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although there's no word about Monster Hunter Wilds making its way to the Switch 2, Capcom did recently announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> for the platform. It will be arriving on Nintendo's new hardware at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has been celebrating Kirby in all sorts of ways recently, and apart from the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> on the Switch 2 this week, it's also been restocking its online shops with some goodies.</p>
<p>The item above, which first appeared in 2022, might not be the most exciting, but hey – we're sure some fans out there will appreciate "shopping bag" Kirby. You can get this "exclusive" My Nintendo Store product in the US and Canada for <strong>600 Platinum Points</strong> (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1961104654101627083">thanks for the heads up, Wario64</a>).</p>

<p>The third-party title got a full cartridge release</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b1cb4e9b9f45/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch 2 generation has got off to a solid start, but not everything has been rosy – with Game-Key Cards becoming a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">huge talking point within the community</a>. Many third-party developers are currently shipping their games on these cards, but have also come under fire for not offering <em>proper</em> physical releases.</p>
<p>Of course, outside of first-party Nintendo games, there are a handful of teams offering their titles on full game cards, so what's the pay-off? While we haven't really had any information about this up until now, CD Projekt Group's latest financial report has shared data about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s digital and physical sales in the Switch 2's launch month.</p>
<p>According to a graphic on the fourth page of this report, approximately <strong>75.4%</strong> of Switch 2 users showed their support for the physical version of this release, which contained the entire game on the cartridge. As you can also see, <strong>24.6%</strong> opted to purchase the game digitally in June, with the game also hovering at the top of eShop purchases in its opening month.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd341d2a7cee8/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing CDPR didn't share alongside this news was the exact sales figures, but according to some other sales updates in select regions recently, Cyberpunk 2077 has been in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">best-selling charts in its opening month</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This follows comments by CDPR's Vice President of Business Development Jan Rosner, who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/cyberpunk-2077-dev-tells-studios-do-not-underestimate-the-physical-edition">spoke earlier this year about offering a "complete" physical edition</a> of Cyberpunk 2077 – stating at the time how "Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere".</p>
<p>He further noted how physical releases are "especially important for the Nintendo audience", acknowledging how "the right thing to do" was to have Cyberpunk 2077 "on the cartridge".</p>
