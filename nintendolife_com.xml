<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91bf859864489/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already know the Switch 2 has broken sales records in the US — just last month, Nintendo's upgraded hybrid console reportedly hit an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">"all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware"</a>. And now, Circana's Mat Piscatella has more data to back up that info.</p>
<p>Sharing the stats on Bluesky, not only is the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in the US <em>ever</em>, but the launch also helped boost video game spending in the US to an all-time June high.</p>
<p>Spending on industry products increased by 22% in June 2025 compared to last year, which is a huge boost. And while the year's overall spending is still slightly behind 2024's (just by 2%), things are looking up thanks to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Originally, we knew the console had sold 1.1 million units in its opening week, but by the month's end, that climbed to 1.6 million units. As a reminder, we know the console has sold over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days</a>, so with the extra 5 million, console sales are already over 4 million.</p>
<p>Hardware spending has increased by 249% compared to last June — to $978 million — another record-setting month for sales, surpassing the previous record of $608 million in June 2008.</p>

<p>In terms of game sales, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was the third best-selling game of the month, right behind Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Elden Ring: Nightreign. However, Nintendo doesn't include digital sales in this data, so if we had to guess, Mario Kart World is <em>possibly</em> number one. Digital sales have boomed in recent years, after all.</p>
<p>In terms of Nintendo games, the Switch 2's line-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a> all made the top ten, with other titles that got free Switch 2 upgrades or paid Switch 2 Editions also making up most of the rest of the list.</p>
<p>There's no stopping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, though!</p>

<p>So, the Switch 2 is doing incredibly well, then! We'll likely hear more on sales figures at Nintendo's next financial briefing, which is due in August.</p>
