<p>On <strong>Wednesday, 12th November 2025</strong> at <strong>6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm GMT</strong>, Nintendo will be debuting the first proper trailer to the sequel to Nintendo and Illumination's 2023 box office smash, <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>A YouTube premiere has already been set up, and you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6ePBMZWeCo">watch it right here</a>.</p>

<p>We've had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1mTbYB6EOM">one brief teaser</a> of the movie during September's Nintendo Direct, which confirmed the film's official title. But other than that, we know little else other than it will be arriving in cinemas on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, earlier today, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a certain character design</a> may have leaked for a second time. You have to imagine everyone's favourite green dinosaur will be showing up here, yeah?</p>
