<p>Sega has shared the opening theme to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> and, rather than pulling in familiar faces such as Crush40, Kellin Quinn, or Madeline Wood, there's a very familiar voice to a certain generation of people from the UK.</p>
<p>James Bourne of the British pop-punk band <strong>Busted</strong> — yes, really — is the lead vocalist on <strong>Cross the Worlds</strong>, the upcoming racer's opening song. We haven't heard the name Buster for a <em>long</em> time. Pinch us.</p>
<p>Composed by Takahiro Kai — one of the composers on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> — the theme itself is very upbeat and pop-rock flavoured, not a million miles away from what we've come to expect from Sonic. A little cheesy? Maybe. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.</p>

<p>We're not sure just how well-known Busted are outside of the UK; the band was formed in 2000 and released two hit albums during their five-year tenure. "What I Go to School For" and "Year 3000" are probably their most well-known hits — the latter of these was covered by the <strong>Jonas Brothers</strong>, and Busted then re-recorded the song with the boy band in 2023.</p>
<p>The band broke up in 2005 so the members could pursue solo projects. Bourne is also the lead singer of the band <strong>Son of Dork</strong> and also had a brief solo career under the name <strong>Future Boy</strong>, before supporting fellow British band <strong>McFly</strong> and forming <strong>McBusted</strong>. Busted reunited in 2015 and are still going.</p>
<p>So... there you have it! Not the collaboration we were expecting, and a bit of a blast from the past for many Brits, we're sure. Whether Bourne appears on other tracks in-game, we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds launches on Switch on 25th September, with a Switch 2 version following later. While the game will feature plenty of Sonic characters, we're also getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sonic-racing-crossworlds-switch-2-version-announced-alongside-paid-upgrade-for-switch">Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, Joker from Persona 5, Steve from Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sonic-racing-crossworlds-officially-reveals-nickelodeon-collaboration">Nickelodeon characters</a> as DLC racers.</p>
