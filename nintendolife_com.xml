<p>A fusion of "belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last year, Arc System Works lifted the lid on <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a></strong>, but one thing missing at the time was a Nintendo version.</p>
<p>Now, during the company's latest showcase this week, a Switch version has been confirmed for release alongside other versions of the game on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This new entry will "revive" this classic beat 'em up series in a new form tailored to modern playstyles. It will also be leveraging Arc System Works' fighting game development experience to deliver a modern beat 'em up "that pursues an exhilarating gameplay feel".</p>
<p>Development producer Tatsunori Ishikawa says the team is pouring its "full effort into development" to ensure the latest entry in this 38-year-old series is released in fighting form.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's been confirmed if you pre-order the game, you'll receive the exclusive classic <strong>Double Dragon Dodgeball</strong>. Pre-orders are also available for this upcoming release in physical and digital form.</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR from Arc System Works official game page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Double Dragon Revive - The Fusion of belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
<p>"In Double Dragon Revive, players will find modern belt-scroll action and exhilarating gameplay. Both longtime fans and newcomers to the series will once again be able to experience the action-packed thrills of the Lee Brothers as they face off the powerful foes of their city!</p>
<p>"Players will find the beloved characters from the golden age of arcades recreated in modern 3D graphics with a unique style! Powerful foes from their past return to face off against the Lee brothers. <em>Double Dragon Revive</em> will feature familiar boss characters from earlier entries along with new bosses. Face the intimidating Shadow Warriors all in this brand new style!"</p>
