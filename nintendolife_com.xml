And in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/46603">Famitsu</a>, where he talks about anime and his love of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, he's particularly gushing about one recent Switch game that he thinks "anyone aspiring to become a game developer" should play.</p>
<p>That title is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and not for the in-game Echoes, summonable monsters, or even the puzzle design. Rather, it's how Nintendo has "used resources" and re-used assets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="AnD-StQ8xqk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea7mszghx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnD-StQ8xqk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1942432023127417087">Genki on X</a>, Yoshi-P says that he "was particularly impressed" with the top-down Zelda game, even compared to other recent games he's been playing.</p>
<p>"What I am about to talk about is a bit nerdy, but even from a producer's perspective there were many points [in the game] that made me think 'Wow, that's amazing', in terms of how they used resources, how they made it, and the game design."</p>
<p>"The base resources used in the game are almost the same as other Zelda games", the director continues, praising Nintendo's ability to keep costs down "by focusing all the efforts on making the game fun to play." Well, that last point is Nintendo to a tee.</p>

<p>But beyond that, Yoshi-P thinks that Echoes of Wisdom is a great case study for people wanting to get into game development; "I would encourage anyone aspiring to become a game developer or who is just starting their career to try playing this game from that perspective."</p>
<p>That's not the first time game developers have been wowed by a Zelda game — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>'s huge open world and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s incredible Ultrahand and Rewind mechanics had many in-awe back when those games launched. Zelda just has that magic, then.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see some of Yoshi-P's own work on the Switch 2; there have been hints and rumours that ports of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/rumour-final-fantasy-devs-supposedly-hint-at-another-nintendo-release">XVI may be on the cards</a> at some point, but nothing has been confirmed.</p>

<p>Sow much fun</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section></header><section><p>When I reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> for Switch before its release, I said the newest entry was a "must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>
<p>Now, having played the game on Switch 2, I can safely say that Guardians of Azuma is still an inventive twist on a beloved series, but there are a few upgrades that make this killer entry in the Rune Factory series even more compelling on the newest Nintendo console.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182553 @ 1752002855 -->
<p>For anyone who already owns the game on Switch, you can purchase a $10 upgrade for Switch 2 that adds mouse functionality for easier building placement and improved graphics which includes a resolution bump and higher frame rate, which now aims for 60fps and largely stays consistent.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, I played the base version of the game on the newer console for a few hours, and it still felt like a slight improvement over playing it before, likely thanks to playing it on a better machine. The larger screen in particular made everything feel more cinematic. If you don’t feel like purchasing the upgrade separately, you’ll still have a great time with the game without it.</p>
<p>That being said, the Switch 2 Edition improvements to the experience are definitely noticeable. Everything is a bit sharper and faster, which I found particularly nice in busier combat situations and as my villages began to grow in size and complexity. And, while I didn’t personally have many distracting performance issues playing the game originally, it feels like it was made specifically for the more-powerful console. The upgrade takes what was already a thoughtful and beautiful gameplay experience to the next, pristine level.</p>
<p>The only mechanical difference is the new mouse functionality, which automatically kicks in when using the Joy-Con 2 mouse in build mode. When building your town, the mouse controls are undoubtedly helpful in creating interesting town designs, but it can be accessed using a regular controller as well. As a result, building is slightly faster, but I generally play in either handheld mode or docked mode with a controller and found removing the Joy-Con 2 just to build somewhat tedious. I’d call the mouse mode a cool addition but not necessary for a rich play experience.</p>
<p>On the whole, Guardians of Azuma is a stellar experience on any platform, with the Switch 2 offering that extra touch of greatness. Those who are particularly sensitive to performance issues will find themselves in safer hands with the upgrade, so long as you're willing to pay an upcharge for the privilege.</p></section></article><div><p>Jess is a writer and game designer based in Chicago.
