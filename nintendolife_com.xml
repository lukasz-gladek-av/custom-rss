<p>The collab some fans have been waiting for</p>

<p>It's confirmed Ezra Duke (Sergeant Duke) is voiced by the accomplished actor Jason Kelley...aka Doom Slayer! Yes, Kelley actually was the voice actor behind id Software's legendary character in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, which was released earlier this year, and he's now voicing a soldier in Samus' latest outing.</p>

<p>The man himself has <a href="https://x.com/Jasonkelley_JK/status/1996311621136973858">even replied to a fan</a>, who requested a "Samus and DOOM" game, while acknowledging the history of the mostly silent protagonists and how they don't actually "say much". Admittedly, this might be as close as fans ever get to seeing Samus and DOOM Slayer in the same game.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Duke is described on Nintendo's Japanese website as being a "veteran who has survived countless battles with the Space Pirate army". And "his stubborn personality often leads to conflicts with his superiors, but his sincere and compassionate nature make him a reliable presence on the battlefield".</p>
<p>Samus will encounter Duke on her new adventure along with various other Galactic Federation soldiers. You can find out more about each character in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-meet-the-team">our previous post</a>.</p>
<p>If this has got you wondering about the possibility of DOOM: The Dark Ages coming to the Switch 2 in the future, there's no official word just yet, but the previous Switch generation saw multiple <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM</a> titles released, including the latest entries. So, hopefully, we see something in the future.</p>
<p>Samus <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-credits-reveal-a-plethora-of-assist-devs-including-next-level-games">has also got a new voice actor</a> in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, with Erin Yvette replacing Jennifer Hale.</p>
