<p>Playable at the World Championships</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> isn't out until October, but this weekend there's a Switch 2 demo at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>The first impressions are now rolling in, and we've put together some thoughts so far – starting with a 'hands on' from our senior video producer Zion Grassl. Although it might not be for everyone, we're thinking the hardcore fans will be pleased with how it's shaping up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"While I’m still trying to temper my excitement and expectations for the overall city exploration, I’m relieved to report the combat, from what I've played, feels like just the thing the series needs to take it into the next generation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what did other outlets have to say about the demo? Here's what's been said so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview">The Verge:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system... It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of <em>Pokémon</em> games<em>.</em> I’m used to thinking about <em>Pokémon</em> like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in <em>Z-A</em>, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">IGN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can see the potential, but with just twenty minutes of experiencing the early game, it’s much too soon to tell if this real-time battle system will scratch the strategy-itch Pokémon games usually do for me."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-active-battle-mechanics/">Polygon:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat felt fresh, and I was only able to see the beginning of it. I wanted to get right back into another epic battle. I wanted <em>more</em>. And this is all based on a relatively small representation of early-game hours. I can only imagine how much more engaging the combat will feel with a full party of Pokémon, all rocking fleshed-out movesets, as you go up against a formidable foe."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/">VGC:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>" Arceus was a game that brought back so many fans, specifically because it departed from the main series formula, and Z-A is an even bigger departure. It will take much more time with the new battle system to get to grips with the new way of taking down Trainers, but we’re thoroughly sold on Rogue Mega Pokémon battles already."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/">Serebii.net</a></h3>
<p>And to round things off, here's what Serebii.net webmaster Joe Merrick had to say about this demo (<a href="https://youtu.be/8bjZLO8cKyw">via Serebii on YouTube</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's still early, and it's hard to say how well the new systems will work in an overall game, but from what I played here, it seems like it's a cool evolution of the Pokémon Legends formula and it has me wanting to go back and play more, which is a good sign in my view."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This demo is available to the general public at the World Championships this weekend, but you'll need to have registered your interest on Nintendo's website with a Nintendo Account, and it's "first come, first served". You can find out more in our post about this demo:</p>

<figure><a title="Geist" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f0f582defdd5/geist.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone, we like to believe, has a made a secret list for every single console they've ever owned, of weird and/or experimental stuff they either want to, or wished they had, played. Sometimes you get round to them, sometimes you don't. You know the sort of thing. For me, on GameCube specifically, things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/cubivore_survival_of_the_fittest">Cubivore</a> come to mind, and to a lesser extent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/geist">Geist</a>. Yes, Geist! Which means "ghost" in German. Did you know that? Of course you did. Every Geisterjäger or Paranormal-Forscher worth their salz knows this stuff.</p>
<p>Now, Geist didn't exactly set the world on fire when it came out, but to skip over it for its shortcomings — of which it has its fair share — is to do yourself out of a genuinely odd, unsettling and actually quite good game. And, you know what, 20 years down the line from when it originally released, it's perhaps more intriguing than ever thanks to how differently it plays compared to many of its peers.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0glzqti&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Also, Nintendo, you folks should just put it on the Switch 2, because its biggest issue was performance, and that'll sort it. Done and dusted.</p>

<p>Geist was originally released on 15th August 2005 in the US, and was developed by n-Space and published by the Big-N itself. In fact, it had the honour of being only the second M-rated game that Nintendo had published for the GameCube — I mentioned the first above (Eternal Darkness). In the game, you play as John Raimi, a boffin who's also a member of the counter-terrorist tactical team known as CR-2.</p>
<p>When a rescue goes wrong at the outset of the adventure, and a whole bunch of people die in various paranormal ways (so like a standard Tuesday night in Glasgow, basically), Raimi finds himself...well, dead, so he's a ghost now, isn't he? So, he's <em>sort of</em> dead. He has become Geist. And this is where it gets interesting, because being a ghost in a video game is exactly the sort of thing we want to spend our time doing; here, n-Space served up something that dared to be a wee bit unique. Now <em>that's</em> terrifying.</p>
<p>Even now, playing the opening of this game treats you to action set-pieces that look good in a sort of chunky-first Halo-esque way. With how badly games of this vintage tend to age in terms of visuals, I still think Geist is a bit of a looker, all things considered, and it gets underway with some nice explosions, possessions and all manner of Spooky Things™ down at the old Volks institute - where experiments of the supernatural kind are happening.</p>

<p>Luckily, Geist doesn't <em>just</em> go with big explosions and shooting things, or else we wouldn't be talking about it. N-Space decided to consider how, as a ghost, you can do many more interesting things, like possess objects and other characters in the environments which you need to puzzle through, to give us a clever and absorbing game in terms of its mechanics.</p>
<p>That's not to say there isn't any shooting at all — there's a decent amount of pew-pew here, and even some decent boss scraps along the way. Indeed, levels tend to end with a test of your reflexes in this way for the most part, so it's good the bosses aren't turgid. But Geist is much more about being a little extra creative. Whether it's taking control of something like a dog bowl in order to create a diversion, or something a little weirder like possessing a shooting game toy (just so you can then play it), or heck, even soda cans have their uses, it's a blast, and it gets you thinking a bit.</p>
<p>Human enemies with special abilities or weapons can be targeted so as to make your way past obstacles and environmental puzzles; a grenade goon will enable you to blow stuff up, an engineer will be useful to clear paths and so on. Before you haunt a human, though, you'll need to scare the bejesus out of them to make them open to the process...so to speak. This is where your loud bangs, noises, and ability to possess beds so you can raise up like a Scooby Doo ghost out of them, comes in handy. The game goes surprisingly deep with this stuff; you can even take out guards by poisoning them, if you know who's cooking their food.</p>

<p>Add to this the usual gamut of security cameras, computers and things of this nature to take over, and you've got a lovely little playground to muck around in, complete with a novel approach to puzzling and a story that, whilst you're definitely not going to be thinking about it afterwards, does its job in keeping you hooked until the reason behind the entire incident that's turned you into a floating mischief-maker is unveiled.</p>
<p>If there's one place where Geist falls down fairly hard, it's the performance. It's a clunky old beast overall, and the frame-rate is pretty inconsistent. The controls, too, whilst fine overall, annoy somewhat with a sluggish camera speed with no way to change it!</p>
<p>However, with a fun multiplayer mode that sees up to 4-players engage in three ghost-based modes, and a campaign you can whip through in about seven hours max, Geist is still a game that I look back on with much fondness, and one of those hidden gems that actually lives up to the name. Stick this on without knowing much about it, and 2005 you was in for quite the treat. You still will be today.</p>
<p>Now, go on and put it on NSO so I can get our fancy new GameCube controllers out and start haunting faucets again. Do it.</p>
