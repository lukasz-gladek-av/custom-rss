<p>Knucklotec hands, to be precise</p>

<figure><a title="Goomba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3d7311482435/goomba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">Ask the Developer interview</a> all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is now available for your perusal, and it's packed with anecdotes and info about the upcoming 3D platformer.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting nugget was that the concept of destruction was actually being worked on before development on Bananza officially began. In fact, one concept video shows that the team experimented by sticking hands onto a Goomba – more specifically, Knucklotec hands from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the team said:</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8oqkgip&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>So it wasn’t that the concept of destruction came first, and then you built a mechanic around it?</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Wataru</strong> <strong>Tanaka:</strong> No. Shortly after <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was released, we started running technical experiments with the idea of, “What kind of game do you get if everything in the environment is destructible?”</p>
<p><strong>Kenta</strong> <strong>Motokura:</strong> We even tried sticking arms on a Goomba.</p>
<p><strong>Tanaka:</strong> That's right, we did. (Laughs) In <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, there’s a boss called Knucklotec who attacks Mario with giant hands. The programmer who created him tried attaching those arms to a Goomba as an experiment. The Goomba could smash terrain, tear off pieces to use as weapons, and throw them. Those actions felt surprisingly satisfying, and we got a sense that this destruction-based gameplay could be a compelling core mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>Motokura:</strong> The results of our tests showed that destruction-based gameplay could work, and it was a good match for Donkey Kong’s enormous strength. We felt that the concept and the core gameplay had clicked into place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's a look at the concept video itself (courtesy of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3ltz2wbwelc2h">Stealth40K</a> on BlueSky):</p>

<p>It's a very barebones video, but you can certainly see how it would go on to inform the gameplay seen in Donkey Kong Bananza. It makes us wonder what other kind of concepts Nintendo has managed to stockpile in recent years, too. Just imagine the possibilities!</p>
<p>The same interview also revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-what-donkey-kong-bananza-looked-like-on-switch-1">what Bananza had looked like when it was in development for the Switch 1</a>. The team stated that they had begun to think about moving the game to Switch 2 in 2021 after it became apparent that the improved specs would lead to more satisfying destruction.</p>

<p>And yes, it works with Switch 2</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="8bitdo Pro 3 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/69d01ec89d28a/8bitdo-pro-3-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 8BitDo</em></figcaption></figure><p>8BitDo, a company that arguably makes some of the finest third-party controllers for the Switch, has announced its new 'Pro 3' model.</p>
<p>Compatible with Switch 1 and Switch 2, it looks pretty familiar to the Pro 2 – why fix what isn't broken 'n' all that – but comes with a wealth of features that will hopefully justify the $69.99 price tag.</p>
<p>First up, we've got swappable ABXY buttons, so if you're keen to remap inputs for certain titles, then this should prove pretty useful. The Pro 3 also comes with its own charging dock, TMR analogue sticks, L4 and R4 bumpers, two back paddles, rumble support, gyro support, and hall effect triggers. Wowza!</p>
<p>It's currently available for pre-order via the official website and Amazon, with shipping estimated to begin on <strong>12th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a look at all features for the Pro 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- TMR Joystick<br>
- Extra bumpers (R4 and L4)<br>
- 2 Pro back paddle buttons<br>
- Trigger mode switch<br>
- Hall effect triggers<br>
- Tactile D-pad<br>
- Swappable magnetic ABXY buttons<br>
- 6-axis motion control (for Switch and Steam only)<br>
- Turbo function<br>
- Vibration<br>
- Support 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2</p>
