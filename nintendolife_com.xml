<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158939/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>While not entirely dormant for the last 30 years, Yuzo Koshiro’s Ancient Corp — responsible for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/streets_of_rage_2">Streets of Rage II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/beyond_oasis">Story of Thor</a>, and the Master System’s superb <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> — is finally back in the public eye with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a>. What’s significant for the small studio is a return to the console that cemented it in the annals of gaming history.</p>
<p>Those who follow Koshiro on social media will know his love for the Mega Drive and its Motorola 68000 processor, and, as such, it is with great fanfare that Earthion has arrived to reignite Sega’s 16-bit powerhouse. Sort of. Intended for a physical release in the first instance, Ancient has instead decided to lead with modern formats to ensure the manufactured cartridge (ostensibly scheduled for 2026) is the best it can possibly be. This has already resulted in improved bullet visibility based on player feedback, and other tweaks via update.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158936/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For Nintendo Switch, then, Earthion works both beautifully in handheld (assuming you use anything other than the stock Joy-Con) and as a bigger, more arresting experience on the TV. Driven by precise emulation, Earthion is actually more the brainchild of Makoto Wada - a fact often drowned out by Koshiro’s celebrity status. Wada is the designer, programmer, planner, and overall director of the game, while Koshiro produces, adding in a blazing soundtrack and crunchy effects.</p>
<p>A clear labour of love, there are a lot of personal touches in Earthion, right down to the barrelled CRT and heavy shadow masking set as the startup screen filter. While pretty, this does make it a little tough for those new to the game to see everything that's going on. It's best, then, to go into the in-game menu and take advantage of one of the most granular and configurable scanline filters around, where you can change percentages by the digit for every aspect of the display.</p>
<p>What smacks you instantly is the game’s graphical bombast. Your craft, the YK-IIA (quite possibly representing someone’s initials), deployed by a mothership and blasting off on stage one, spins dynamically from the foreground to take its firing position amidst a booming space war of lasers and debris.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158942/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Koshiro's soundtrack ploughs you in, driving the action from one set-piece to the next in a game of near-constant variety. Giant mechs tear through space stations; lasers rip up through the floor of a technological, dinosaur-patrolled lost world; towering guardians rise from seething lava pits; and maddened alien monsters give chase through tight futuristic chicanes and sinewy, pulsating hives.</p>
<p>Bosses are profound — at one point stretching three-screens-tall — and come at you with smartly engineered attack patterns that only occasionally feel a touch haphazard. Moreover, the sheer number of regular enemy types is equally impressive, introducing small, medium, and large foes at breathless pace, ever-changing the game’s spots and continually keeping you on your toes. It’s hard to say if it can run so flicker and slowdown-free on real Mega Drive hardware, although beefed-up chipsets may do the job.</p>
<p>To help you deal with the barrage, the game employs multiple weapon options and a divisive regenerating shield system. Should you get pummelled too much when your shields are low and the warning is blaring, you’ll go up in flames; but, avoid damage for a brief period and that protective blue bar will work its way back to top-spec.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158945/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Earthion is engineered more around taking fire and surviving than absolute precision dodging — especially in its latter stages — and to some this may be irksome. But, with extended play, Earthion’s mechanics reveal themselves to work very well indeed, with the survival aspect nicely implemented around the increasingly dense flak. While at first it may seem complex, and you’re likely to go up in smoke early on, once you grasp the balancing it becomes both much easier and very encouraging to clear.</p>
<p>Wada’s ideas are unique and interesting. You start out with two shield bars, two weapon power bars, and two weapon slots. You can fill the swappable weapon slots with lasers, homing missiles, and twin-firing cannon pick-ups, amongst others, and, by grabbing green icons spilled from the destruction, you can keep those weapons chugging at their most powerful state.</p>
<p>Most important to the game’s strategy is the “Adaptation Pod” released at the tail-end of each stage. Grabbing this will occupy one weapon slot and has no in-play function, restricting you to a single actual weapon of choice to battle the boss. Should you manage to hold on to the Adaptation Pod (which is at risk of being destroyed should you take too much fire), it can then be spent at the mid-stage interval to upgrade your craft via a menu. Options here include adding additional shields, increasing max weapon power and slots, or even an extra life.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158940/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>How you choose to spend the Adaptation Pod is down to the player, although in reality there are better ways to apply them. From personal experience, whereby I managed to pin down two one-credit clears, the upgrades that seem most immediately beneficial (like extra lives) aren’t always best in the long-term.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Wada’s approach to Earthion is multi-functional. In a positive way, it feels markedly different from the genre norm, and lot of this is owed to how broad and unique the various weaponry is, and their distinct usefulness in certain sections. It's also designed to be friendlier to new audiences; not just through its several difficulty levels or mid-stage ship upgrades, but its password system - one that allows you to carry over boosted shields and weaponry to subsequent playthroughs. This is a nice, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/radiant_silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>-style augmentation that allows anyone the chance to complete the game through multiple attempts. For those who want to have at it traditionally, though, the password option can be comfortably ignored.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158944/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that the Switch version seems to have been toned down ever so slightly in its default difficulty. No doubt whatever changes have been made here have now also been patched through to the Steam version, resulting in a game that feels cleaner and easier to navigate than its initial release. It wasn't overly difficult to begin with, only sitting mid-range in terms of shoot-'em-up challenge, but some further fine-tuning has definitely occurred, removing certain popcorn enemies and refining some of the bullet spreads and speeds. Overall, it's now at its most enjoyable state.</p>
<p>Earthion is a game that may not click immediately. It looks and sounds fantastic, but its idiosyncrasies take a few runs to adjust to. To that end, it requires time to grow on you. Once it clicks, you'll find yourself engrossed in strategising a path to victory, and the wonderful risk-reward of the Adaptation Pod. It’s full of neat elements, including safe spots and techniques, where the more unlikely, less obvious weapons can prove advantageous in certain areas. There are multiple methods of approach for bosses, and there are several extra lives dotted about to keep you in play.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158943/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What it does brilliantly is in its constant inventiveness, requiring the learning of the smallest of enemies to the largest of bosses; and its final third is thoroughly climactic. It has a big-budget, arcade feel to it, and really nice introduction and ending sequences.</p>
<p>It is, however, imperfect overall, with Wada’s creative enterprising never quite hitting that absolute shoot-'em-up adrenaline high, that pocket of euphoria that comes from pure and perfect dodges, near misses, and glorious untouched victories. The bullets can still be difficult to spot in places, and will often tag you because of it, and the soundtrack — while top-notch by Mega Drive standards — doesn't excel beyond the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gleylancer">Gleylancer</a>, <strong>Thunder Force III</strong>, or the more recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/andro_dunos_2">Andro Dunos 2</a>.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Earthion is a terrific piece of work. It's more an accomplished production, arguably, than a shoot 'em up of incredible highs, but at the same time, that’s part of its charm. It has a different feel thanks to its shield system and mid-stage upgrade rungs, and this is a refreshing and welcome change from the norm. Much of the fun is in figuring out the order of bolstering your ship and the little tricks that various weaponry affords when faced with tricky junctures. It does some things other shoot 'em ups don’t do, and is all the more standout for it.</p>
<p>At the same time, it fails to achieve some things that other shoot 'em ups do so well. Nonetheless, Earthion is a treat of a game: a bold new Mega Drive work that sits in the upper echelons of the console's broad catalogue, and shouldn't be passed up by fans of the genre or wonderful 16-bit works.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Metroid Dread" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a9fba4d700ec/metroid-dread.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well hello there. Welcome. It's the weekend, and that means you're keen to see what we're going to be playing over the next couple of days while divulging your own plans. Before you do so, however, let's just recap the last handful of days.</p>
<p>First up, Nintendo announced that it would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-gba-library-with-two-more-titles">expanding its GBA app</a> with two new titles on NSO next week, so that's pretty cool. The company also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-showcases-every-switch-and-switch-2-direct-game-in-new-infographic">reiterated its recent Direct announcements</a> with the usual handy infographic. Lots of cool stuff coming out, y'all.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/it-was-a-bit-of-a-perplexing-experience-hideki-kamiya-on-the-fan-reaction-to-bayonetta-3">voiced his thoughts</a> around the reception to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>, ensuring to apply his learnings to the development of the <strong>Okami Sequel</strong>. Plus, we were treated to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2-gets-a-seven-minute-overview-trailer">pretty extensive overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on the Switch, and it's looking very tasty.</p>
<p>Finally, we provided our final thoughts on both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> DLC, so be sure to check those out if you're on the fence.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I am going to wrap myself up in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> on Switch 2 as much as I can. I'm on my own for the next few days, you see, so it's gonna be 24/7 rage-quitting online matches and looking up soccer rules in disbelief for me, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Oh, and I can't stop playing Silksong. But I don't imagine I'm particularly unique in that just now. Have a nice weekend, and should we cross paths on the FC 26 early access field of battle over the next 48hrs or thereabouts, well, honestly, I hope you get a proper stuffing, mate.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I could say "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> plus X and Y" as I have the past few weeks, but really it's just going to be Hollow Knight. I just found the double-jump and the downward-smash in quick succession, and I'm eager to crack on and make proper progress towards the endgame. <em>Newsflash!</em> It's good. It's not blowing my mind, but it feels great (man, I wish I had that Switch 2 Pro Controller, though!) and, more to the point, I'm still playing it after 20 hours. It's doing something right.</p>
<p>But yeah, I'm eager to finish. GOTY will be here before you know it.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm getting very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, folks. So I've gone back to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> one more time before Retro's latest drops in December. It's like comfort food for me, it's just too good.</p>
<p>I'd like to say I'm playing something else, but that's pretty much it! Truth be told, I'm eager to dive into <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> next week on PS5, so I'm holding off on playing anything too substantial in the meantime.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was a very lucky boy and got both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> for my birthday this week, two short little games that I could probably breeze through in a weekend (hahaha… <strong><em>gulp</em></strong>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both have sat on the sideline since I pulled them from their brightly coloured wrapping paper because Silksong is eating up <em>all of my free time.</em></p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I’m in a post-Silksong slump. I’m actually fighting back the urge to do a second playthrough or a Steel Soul run right now. But no, I have to get ready for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>’s 1.0 launch, so naturally, it’s time to start afresh in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> and see how much recent muscle-memory will screw me over.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I still have a ton of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> games to check out, but I cannot put Magic Garden down. I’m so close to getting the cherry and all achievements on it, and it’s so fun and moreish. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This is a big weekend for me! After nearly a decade of saying “This is the year I’m going to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>” it’s finally happening. I’m currently hunting down the last few Chozo Artifacts (which have been a huge pain in the morphball to find) and thankfully <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-remastered-all-artifact-locations">Ollie’s guide</a> here on Nintendo Life is keeping me sane!</p>
<p>I’ll probably wrap this up over the weekend, but there’s also the off chance that I play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> all weekend as you can now pilot the Power Rangers Megazord from now until October 3rd! I just unlocked the Green Ranger skin from the battle pass too! Young Zion is freaking out right now. I want to savour this moment for as long as I can, but honestly I wish these Fortnite events didn’t have an end date. Why can’t they run year round, as maybe a separate game mode?</p>

<p>If you are curious to know how this new experience generally holds up, this round up should help. When we hear more about the Switch version, we'll let you know. The Switch 2 version is also scheduled to arrive at a later date and will be available as a paid upgrade for the existing Switch release.</p>
<p>So, here are the impressions of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/sonic-racingcrossworlds/">VGC - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"CrossWorlds is a brilliant karting game with satisfying handling, a fun portal mechanic and useful customisation options. Its weapons aren't as punchy as we'd like and it's unclear how it's going to keep players' attention long-term but it's a genuine, more traditional alternative to Mario Kart now that Nintendo's pointed its series in new direction."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xpjqyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/">GamesRadar+ - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a slick, ambitious racer with loads of tracks, primed and ready for future, licensed crossovers. At first too slow and then suddenly extremely fast, the racing lacks finesse, but it gets better as you play. A strong offering that's compulsively playable, but a bit grindy in single-player and not quite S-tier on the track."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">IGN - 9/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review-an-arcade-kart-racer-for-gearheads/1900-6418408/">GameSpot - 7/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Altogether, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a solid package. The single-player modes, meta-goals like collecting gear and vehicle parts, and wealth of customization options to experiment with different play styles, make it easy to recommend for players who like their kart racing with a little more mechanical complexity. Even with slightly underwhelming online offerings, it's easy to see how Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has plenty of road ahead of it."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/a-new-dimension-of-kart-racing">Game Informer - 8.5/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds offers some exciting twists on the tried-and-true kart-racing formula, making for a streamlined experience that wastes no time getting you into the action. Though there’s substantially less content and replayability than its primary contemporary, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is concise and effective in its mission, offering the most well-rounded kart racer of the year."</p>

<p>A free DLC is "coming soon"</p>

<figure><a title="Rune Factory Story of Seasons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59cdc253d16c1/rune-factory-story-of-seasons.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> got off to a solid start, with Marvelous revealing the RPG spin-off had already shipped more than 500,000 copies as of August.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, a special collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> has been announced. This will be a free DLC and is "coming soon", so expect "more details" soon.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar was released on the Switch and Switch 2 in August, and we called it the farming series' best remake yet. Guardians of Azuma arrived on both of these platforms in June and we thought the experience was "near-perfect" on the new Nintendo system.</p>
<p>You can learn more about both of these titles in our reviews here on Nintendo Life:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xpjqyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
