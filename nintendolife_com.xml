<p>As is customary, we thought it wise to throw a bunch of predictions into the ring and see what Nintendo's partner publishers might be cooking up for the Switch and Switch 2 in the coming months. We already have the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> on the way, but we reckon there's room for a <em>lot</em> more.</p>
<p>As ever, we encourage you to share your own predictions with a comment in the usual place, but for now, let's see what Team NL thinks will be announced in the upcoming Direct...</p>

<h2>Fantasy Isn't Dead - Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b1239656cdb6"><a title="Direct Predictions 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b1239656cdb6/direct-predictions-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hello, yes, I’m going to gently ask for more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>…</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a nice way to start out the Switch 2’s 2026, isn’t it? I bet Atlus will bring <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> to the table. I don’t know whether I’ll make time to play through it again… but gosh, it’d be nice to make it available on another platform. It’s my favourite modern Atlus game.</p>
<p>Capcom’s Switch 2 support will continue, too, and I think there’s a good chance <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will pop up, seeing as they’re working on improvements for other platforms.</p>
<p>Two games I want to see more of are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> – two very different ones, I know, but the former looks <em>beautiful</em> and the latter is just more HD-2D but in action form.</p>
<p>I’ll end things on another Square Enix prediction (which is on-brand): Final Fantasy… <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">XIV</a>. Yep. I reckon this could be a big showcase for the company anyway (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a>, anyone?), so why not throw in something extra?</p>
<h2>Arise Now, ye Tarnished - Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<figure data-uuid="25588ed099d64"><a title="Direct Predictions 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25588ed099d64/direct-predictions-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, I'll make the most of these invincibility frames and dodge roll right into the most obvious picks of the bunch. I think this is when we get an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> date. It has been cropping up at far too many public events to still be <em>that far</em> off, and I can't imagine FromSoft wants to extend the delay any longer than it has to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> feels likely, too. It's weird how much of the Switch 2 reveal Direct was dedicated to this one (it even got a Creator's Voice spotlight afterwards), and then we've heard... nothing since. Give this little rat boy some more info!</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll throw in all of the usual suspects that I like to get out on a prayer. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> Switch 2 port, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> on Switch (it's too big for an Indie World now, I reckon), Nintendo's finally given the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> guys a devkit. Go on, let's have a release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a>, too — I need this game to come out before Level-5 destroys my enthusiasm completely.</p>
<h2>Come Out Swinging - Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<figure data-uuid="007777613c997"><a title="Direct Predictions 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/007777613c997/direct-predictions-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/alan_wake_2">Alan Wake 2</a> with the DLC bundled; kind of the equivalent of the <strong>Resident Evil Gold Editions</strong>, y’know? It’s also a bit of a long shot, but I think it’s time <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/psychonauts">Psychonauts</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/psychonauts_2">its sequel</a> came to the Switch 2. And let’s get another fighting collection from Capcom, hm? I know we’re kinda running out of titles at this point, but I’m sure there’s room for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultra_street_fighter_iv">Ultra Street Fighter IV</a> somewhere.</p>
<p>Sticking with the fighters for a moment, I know y’all are hankering for <strong>Capcom vs. SNK 3</strong>. Me too, man, me too. I think the Switch 2 has a real shot at being a legit destination for fighters, and an announcement here would give it a real boost with the FGC.</p>
<p>Capcom won’t stop there though – oh no. Given that it recently took part in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">huge preview event with Nintendo</a>, this paves the way for some other titles. Resident Evil’s 30th anniversary is on the way, so it’s about time we get the OG trilogy on Switch and Switch 2. Don’t stop there, though. Give us a remastered port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Outbreak</a>, dagnabbit!</p>
<p>Oh, and Ubisoft will fail to read the room with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance</a> update.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon To Kick Off 30th Anniversary Celebrations At The Super Bowl]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> will be at the Super Bowl! No, they're not taking to the field — we're not sure we'd want to see some cute critters get trampled on during the biggest night in sports (though we reckon Machamp could sack Drake Maye or Sam Darnold), but the franchise will be bringing a commercial to the show.</p>
<p>Super Bowl commercials are usually a big deal, and with Pokémon about to celebrate its 30th anniversary, what better time to kick off the party than on 8th February 2026, during the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. As an aside, the <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> is <em>also</em> meant to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/super-bowl-movie-trailers-preview-2026-1236705023/">be getting a trailer</a>, so that's two things to keep an eye out for.</p>
<p>For Pokémon, at least, we have a little teaser to go on that shows Jigglypuff in what looks like a comfy backstage area. The pink Pokémon is mostly chilling on the sofa, but they move around every so often. We also get another look at the 30th anniversary logo, a simple Pikachu face with 3 and 0 replacing its red cheeks.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-30th-Celebration-Teaser">press release</a>, The Pokémon Company International says that the commercial is intended to kick off a yearlong campaign for the franchise, and that "More details about the yearlong campaign will be unveiled following Super Bowl LX, including fan-focused activations."</p>
<p>But, ahead of Sunday, if you head over to the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/30th-celebration">Pokémon Center</a>, you can check out a whole range of 30th anniversary apparel and goods, which are on sale right now.</p>
<figure data-uuid="52c1591b86339"><a title="Pokemon 30th anniversary apparel" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52c1591b86339/pokemon-30th-anniversary-apparel.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't expect any big announcements from the commercial itself, though. We expect we'll be getting the usual Pokémon Presents on the 27th February, which is when some of the bigger gaming news will hit.</p>
<p>For now, just enjoy Jigglypuff. And if you happen to be in New York later this month, then why not plan a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-30th-anniversary-nintendo-store-event-announced-us">trip to the Nintendo Store for some 30th anniversary goodness</a> on the date?</p>
