<p>C. Viper returns this Autumn</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following a leak earlier on, Capcom has now officially released the teaser trailer for the next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC character.</p>
<p>The secret agent C. Viper, who originally made her debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>, is scheduled to arrive in Street Fighter 6's World Tour, Battle Hub and Fighting Grounds on <strong>Autumn 2025</strong> for all platforms including the Switch 2.</p>
<p>She's part of the game's third year of DLC, which also includes Sagat (out this week), as well as Alex (<strong>Early Spring 2026</strong>) and Ingrid (<strong>Late Spring 2026</strong>).</p>

<p>In addition to this, Capcom has released a new trailer for the next batch of DLC outfits coming to the game.</p>

<p>Apart from these new trailers for Street Fighter 6, one other Capcom announcement at EVO 2025 was a free title update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>. It's out this week and will add Ingrid as well as multiple other characters to Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and Street Fighter 6 in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life. There's also a demo for the sixth entry available on the Switch 2.</p>

<figure><a title="Dk map article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4782dfb7bef11/dk-map-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of fun to be had in smashing the place to tiny little voxel pieces in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, it's easily its biggest draw. People have been into the sweet catharsis of wanton destruction since way back before there were even people. Probably.</p>
<p>However, the one thing that's caught my attention most whilst playing thus far - and I must admit, I'm only around about halfway through the campaign at this point - is the game's absolutely beautiful world map design. I love it.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't have the same level of interactivity and usefulness as some other games do, and sometimes it gets lost when you've dug through miles of terrain, but it's not about that. Donkey Kong Bananza's map's strength lies in how it gives you the actual level you are on, fully realised as adorable 3D miniature, like a diorama that you can swirl around and see exactly what is in front, to the side, above, below and beyond you.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>When you press the map button, the camera zips you up and out of the level to look down upon the earth like some sort of hairy, banana-addled God. What's more, it tallies all of your actions and activities and replicates all the damage you've done across the layer. It's a magic, real-time tracker kind of thing, and it's got me dazzled.</p>
<p>There's almost a game within a game here where you can set points of interest or places you want to get to just for fun, rather than for the sake of progression, and then work through the area both in-game and through the map, jumping seamlessly too and fro, in order to do some satisfying messing around and discovering. I love how it orientates you, too. Jump into this map and direct yourself towards something, then back out and DK is pointed where you are headed.</p>
<p>It also allows you to do fun things with the landscape. I mean, who knows what I could sculpt that great big mountain in the distance into if I really <em>think</em> about it? And when I've decided, I can go into the map to get a bird's eye view on the progress of my mountain that's shaped like Wario's butt. Woah! Wait a minute.... Where did that come from?</p>

<p>The more intricate the level, the more impressed I am. I've spent far too much time spinning these maps around and resetting the terrain so it's all fresh and new and ready to destroy all over again. And, for a game that's got so much going on elsewhere, this ingenious little map really has become the cherry on top for me.</p>
<p>Of course Nintendo is no stranger to the World Of Very Good World Mapsâ„¢. In fact, one of my earliest and most lasting memories of gaming is how blown away I was by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</a>'s map back in the days when I'd play my full-colour games on a barely working black and white TV. Yes, I am a dinosaur. And a bald one, to boot.</p>
<p>The parallaxing wonder that was A Link to the Past's map though, my goodness. And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/5j835r/map_of_hyrule_legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past/">you got a paper copy of it in the box as well</a>. Halcyon days. It was the first time I'd seen a map and thought of it as an organic and useful part of a game as a whole. It wasn't some stuffy menu that was separated off; it put you above the world, not removed temporarily to the back rooms, still in-game, just from a different perspective. It's amazing how much this adds to the escapism of an adventure. It certainly had 13 year old me more invested in a game than I'd ever been before.</p>

<p>Zelda has continued to innovate and impress in the cartography department, too. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> give us these enormously complex maps that show you where you need to go and where you've just been. They also retain the magic of A Link to the Past's effort by teasing you ahead of time, showing you places that you want to go, intriguing things you want to see or mess with. These maps do their jobs by being a guiding companion, but they also keep you hooked by enhancing the game's ability to embed you in its world.</p>
<p>Then we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, another game that absolutely floored me with its map. Previously I'd found Metroid a little tortuous â€” sometimes you blame yourself in tough situations, saying you're just not good enough or patient enough to play that type of game. But it was the map's fault! Blame the game, give yourself a mental health break. As soon as you popped in Super Metroid's cartridge, with its incredibly useful maze of a map, everything clicked into place. Ah yes, this is why people like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> and why there are <em>so many</em> Metroidvanias out there. Thanks maps!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> carries on in the same glorious vein; its map is another ludicrously labyrinthian affair, but your path and location remain crystal clear an all times. And the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_trilogy">Prime Trilogy</a> map, well, it's just more of that good gravy. Not as fundamentally game-changing as its predecessors, perhaps, but certainly showing that the love is still there, and now lifted into three dimensions. It makes me sick to think about how complicated creating this stuff must be, which is a sure sign that it's a good thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> is another example of a map I was in love with as a kid. Again, not the most useful, overall, but it doesn't need to be. It looks amazing, it's interactive as you move across the paths that link all the levels together, and it keeps you in the world, in that <em>not-real-life</em> headspace, which is where I belong.</p>
<p>And just like all the other games mentioned, it teases you in the same ways. You immediately need to know where all those little caves go, what that suspicious patch is over there, etc. And all of this is to speak nothing on how the map designs add to, or even speak to, the style, the vibe, and the architecture of the worlds that they're a part of. They fit, they enhance and they improve.</p>

<p>So, whilst smashing the place to a billion beautiful pieces in Bananza, zipping in and out of its map, twirling and zooming, plotting and planning, I've been reminded in a wonderfully nostalgic burst of all this lovely stuff. It's nice to see that, as much as the technology may change and gamers might want different things from the experiences they buy into, Nintendo has stuck to giving us some of the best maps in the industry.</p>
<p>When you think about all these maps, especially with how complex the latest Zelda ones have been, it feels like a bit of a full circle moment that, in DK's latest outing; you get to tear the map apart until there's nothing but the skeleton of a world remaining.</p>

<p>Yes, hello folks, it's your regularly scheduled eShop Selects, this time for July 2025. As always, we're looking at the best of the rest â€” the best eShop exclusives you may have missed on Switch 1 and Switch 2. Yes, other games besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <em>did</em> come out, you know?</p>
<p>A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has kept the future looking bright for both consoles, so let's peel through the rules because we have a good one this month; our writers and contributors vote for their top three games from our pile of reviews of eShop exclusives that launched in July 2025. Those games are then scored (with 1 getting the highest score, 3 the lowest), then we tally the results up and the trio with the highest total make our top three.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067swhyiv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> is missing here, we know â€” review codes for the Switch release weren't available until launch day (the very last day of the month). So, we promise we're beavering away to get our impressions to you, but that's why you won't see it included below.</p>
<p>Overall, nine games made the cut for votes this month. Everything below scored at least a 7/10 or above, so here's what <em>just</em> missed out on the podium:</p>

</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">3rd Place - Time Flies</a></h2>
<p>Here's an odd gem we've had an eye on since a Day of the Devs stream a few years ago. Time Flies is a philosophical tale about a fly who only has a short amount of time to live. What can they do in that small slice of life they were handed from birth? Whatever they want.</p>
<p>Did you know flies can get drunk? Or make music? Or not be annoying? And look, we're not saying the timing of releasing after Mario Paint arrived on NSO (with that fly swatting game) was prophetic, but... okay, look, the art style is so similar.</p>
<p>Time Flies is short, sweet, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/time-flies">an excellent 8/10 pick-up</a> for the Switch.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:185093 @ 1754296079 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">2nd Place - Monument Valley 3</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Monument Valley</strong> series feels like a no-brainer for Switch, but amazingly, it took until this year to get <em>any</em> of the games on the hybrid series. Fortunately, the newest entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley III</a>, followed soon after. And it's just as excellent.</p>
<p>The lack of touch controls might be a dampener, but there's some incredibly thoughtful and clever puzzling to experience here. It's also beautiful to look at, with stunning uses of colour and perspective to make each puzzle shine. it might be the easiest of the trio, but it's still well worth a go.</p>
<p>Have a read of our review if you want to know more; it more than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/monument-valley-iii">earned its 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">1st Place - Patapon 1+2 Replay</a></h2>
<p>There was a clear winner for July, with the PSP's darling making a bold multiplatform comeback courtesy of Bandai Namco. That's right, it's all about 'pata-pata-pon-pon!' Congratulations to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, which got votes from all but one participant.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what Patapon is, you're basically an invisible entity commanding a group of strange creatures to the beat of their music. They'll react to your drum beats and run, guard, attack, and rush. Every single song is a complete earworm, and with all the helpful little features added into this version, both games have never played better.</p>
<p>We may have scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">a 7/10</a>, but it's still marched its way into our hearts.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-july-2025]]></content:encoded>
