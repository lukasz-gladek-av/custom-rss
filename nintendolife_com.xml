<figure><a title="Helldivers 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/813674842bbb6/helldivers-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Arrowhead Game Studios, SIE</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Arrowhead Game Studios shell-shocked the games industry – announcing it would be bringing its PvE third-person shooter <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/helldivers_2">Helldivers 2</a> to the Xbox. Yes, the Sony-published game exclusive to PlayStation on consoles, is now making its way to Microsoft's hardware.</p>
<p>Given the timing of all this, there are now (<em>unsurprisingly</em>) some Helldivers calling for a Switch 2 port, with threads on <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1940824347587010622">Reddit and social media popping up</a> – asking the folks at Arrowhead to "let everyone in", in reference to Nintendo players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 has all the credentials to handle Helldivers, if Steam Deck can do it, the new Switch will do it without any problems"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it's the Switch 2's recent release that's given <em>some</em> fans hope as the game is now dropping on Xbox next month. As you might also expect, there are plenty of other opinions about the possibility of something like this happening – with many Helldivers ruling it out due to how demanding the online multiplayer title can be (especially in its more hectic moments). However, other players think it should happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I got over 550 hours on my Steam Deck, let 'em in, I say"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment is behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_25">MLB The Show</a>, which is already available on other platforms, but it's also a sport-licensed game. Helldivers is obviously <em>different</em> in that respect with live service updates, and the community has played a huge role in sustaining the popularity of the game.</p>
<p>For now, Helldivers can expect reinforcements to arrive on Xbox this August. You can find out more about this particular version of the game on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/helldivers-2-is-officially-releasing-for-xbox-this-august">our sibling site Pure Xbox</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35617b657a7b2/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today released brand new updates for the Switch 2 and Switch versions of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a></strong>.</p>
<p>So, if you boot up these games on either system, you should be prompted to update. These latest patches, which bump TotK to Version 1.4.2 and BotW to Version 1.8.2, resolve not only "several issues" but also fix some issues tied to the "<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-so-have-you-used-zelda-notes-yet">Zelda Notes</a></strong>" in the Switch 2 versions of each game.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support pages:</p><div><figure data-videoid="5VNLcGb4n_E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VNLcGb4n_E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5VNLcGb4n_E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VNLcGb4n_E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31cf32ktvljs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VNLcGb4n_E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>From the team behind Mario Party</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Party Jamboree" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db5b9f7032a23/mario-party-jamboree.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the confirmation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s developer earlier this week, it seems a team has now been officially linked to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>As highlighted by GamesRadar+, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party">Mario Party</a> team Nintendo Cube (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooGCk57N3GDMX0le3VmJfxJCweIkRoBIVul0Ub8rUyz_XgdkjgN">seemingly alongside involvement from Nintendo EPD</a>) – with the Japanese developer recently posting this information on its company website:</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Cube" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/691dd3106ae85/nintendo-cube.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo Cube (which has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/mario-party-dev-ndcube-has-officially-changed-its-name">co-developed multiple titles with Nintendo EPD</a> previously) has also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and more recently the "complete" version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/animal_crossing_pocket_camp_complete">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a>. And if you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</a>, you might have noticed how the avatars (<em>and generally relaxing vibe</em>) are somewhat similar, so it all checks out!</p>
<figure><a title="Clubhouse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08a9218bc84c5/clubhouse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, now you at least know who you were supporting when buying this paid game (which originally had some people calling for it to be a free "pack-in" title). This same developer has been working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> – arriving later this month on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>
