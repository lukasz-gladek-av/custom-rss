<p>According to a new copyright listing</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong - Mario Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a39b4952f817/donkey-kong-mario-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the monumental success of <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, it seems Nintendo and Universal are keen to expand on its new venture beyond the upcoming sequel in 2026.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-and-universal-pictures-seemingly-pursuing-donkey-kong-movie/">Nintendo Everything</a>, a <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">new copyright filing</a> has been spotted that is simply listed as <strong>'Untitled Donkey Kong Project ;Motion picture'</strong>. The date of recordation is 6th June 2025, with two dates listed as the execution: 9th May and 17th May 2025.</p>
<p>Now, are we absolutely sure that this relates to a new movie starring Donkey Kong? No. But given that it's listed as a 'motion picture' and it's from both Nintendo and Universal leads us to believe that maybe a spin-off starring DK is in very early pre-production (or if not pre-production, then early discussions, at least).</p>
<figure><a title="DK Movie - Copyright" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/671a601aee3cc/dk-movie-copyright.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">Public Records</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo currently has two movie projects officially in the works. The first is a direct sequel to the Mario Movie – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/super-mario-world-looks-to-be-the-official-name-of-the-next-mario-movie">rumoured to be titled 'Super Mario World'</a> – scheduled for release on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>. The second is a Legend of Zelda live-action movie scheduled for release on <strong>7th May 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>It's likely, then, that if a Donkey Kong movie is indeed in the works, then we probably won't be seeing it for a few years yet. Chances are, however, that Nintendo will be keen to retain the voice talent from the Mario Movie. Seth Rogan voiced DK himself and Fred Armisen voicing Cranky Kong.</p>
<p>It looks like we're seeing the start of a 'Mario Cinematic Universe', folks – or 'MCU' for short. We're certain that won't cause any confusion... Maybe 'Nintendo Cinematic Universe' is better.</p>

<p>A Switch 2 user claims they've got the game early</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b84bbc2b9c09/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> isn't officially available for Switch 2 until next week, but it seems copies may already be out in the wild.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/50710-donkey-kong-bananza-s-street-date-has-been-broken">highlighted by GoNintendo</a>, a user on the Nintendo Switch subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mark7z/">known as 'Mark7z'</a> has supposedly acquired a copy of DK's anticipated release early.</p>
<p>Attached to the user's post are photos of the box art and game card, and in follow-up comments are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lye5oy/comment/n2u21im/?context=3">some photos of the game's home menu icon</a>, as well as photos of the game in what's claimed to be a "playable" state.</p>

<p>The same individual says they didn't get it from a store, but instead through their "connection" and goes on to mention how the title is currently running on Version 1.0.0 – with an update, apparently, ready to go. They add that they <em>won't</em> be installing this update until release day.</p>
<p>Some replies to this post also raised some concerns about the type of game card included, and the user responded, stating it's not a "game-key card" but an "actual" game card.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8ozjtgp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, street dates being broken on major first-party Nintendo titles (along with leaks) was quite common during the Switch generation. So, this might not go down well at Nintendo headquarters, seeing as how the official release for DK's new outing isn't until <strong>17th July 2025</strong>, and this is the first major game to follow the system's launch and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:185143 @ 1752435297 -->
<p>If we hear any significant updates or more cases of this game being accessed by other Switch 2 users ahead of its launch, we'll let you know. At the very least, consider this a warning that story-related leaks (or more) could potentially start circulating online in the coming days.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f75f64ff116d8/magical-quest-3-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Looking back at last week, we checked out Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the N64, pitting North America and Europe against Japan. It wasn't even close either, with the western design winning with a resounding 89% of the vote. 89%! We quite like the Japanese design too...</p>
<p>This week, we're looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/disneys_magical_quest_3_starring_mickey_and_donald">Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey And Donald</a> for the GBA. Why? Because that's the one I found first, okay? Released in 2005, it was a port of the original 1995 SNES version and received fairly middling reviews, with most finding it to be a lesser game than its predecessors.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fmvlkyq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>But let's cut to the chase. It's a full blown brawl this week with three combatants. So let's get cracking!</p>
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9399360f08982/magical-quest-3-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe and Japan share similarities this week, but it's North America that went down a different route with its approach. It's still got Mickey and Donald front and centre, but they're chilling out in a forest area, and Mickey is all kitted out in his knight's armour. Rad.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0d9879bc381f/magical-quest-3-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design seems slightly more action-packed, and Donald's wearing a different costume here too. Both characters are punching and whacking enemies, while the logo design itself is similar to North America's albeit with a dark shadow surrounding the letters.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e8c60871b7bf/magical-quest-3-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's design uses the same artworks as Europe's, but you can see a bit more of it this time. We love the logo design here too, but we must admit that the yellow background is kinda gross.</p>

We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/tony-hawk-reiterates-decisions-behind-song-choices-in-pro-skater-3-plus-4</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> rolled out on multiple platforms this week, and while it's a fantastic throwback to the glory days of the series, there are obviously some differences. Apart from the changes to THPS4, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">the soundtrack</a> is missing some notable classics.</p>
<p>The Birdman himself <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">already explained to fans months ago</a> how he wanted to include "some different songs" – including different songs by some of the same artists.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://youtu.be/W_PvXRze24U">recent interview with BBC News</a>, he reiterated how this decision was apparently about introducing players to new music they might not have heard before. He also reminded fans how he's not the only one who makes the calls about the game's soundtrack – acknowledging the team's input, but he did manage to get at least some of his picks in the latest release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tony Hawk:</strong> "These days, just what I think fits, and what I'm interested in – I'm not the only decider in these soundtracks, but I did manage to throw a couple of bands in... I also picked songs by artists that were already in the game, but a different song, and not everyone agreed with that decision, but I feel like 'let's keep it fresh' and also 'here's help discovering other music', and I think in the beginning that's what people expected of it – once the soundtrack was a prominent part of the game, people were like 'ok' what are you going to throw at us now?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His latest comments about the game's soundtrack also respond to a question about why <a href="https://youtu.be/-NPLYBIwjjg">Alien Ant Farm's song 'Wish'</a> was excluded from the latest release – with the reason, supposedly, once again tied to the concept of making room for "new acts and new songs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wasn't zeroing in on them per say, it was more we're trying to make room for new acts and new songs as well, and not everything makes the cut, it's nothing personal, and I appreciate that people have a fondness for that song [Wish], especially in relation to our game, so you know, just fire it up on your streaming service if you're so inclined."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70c87ee8ffe45/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-plus-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The previous release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> adopted a similar approach with the soundtrack, and <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/au/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-new-skaters">the character roster in the latest game</a> follows the same format (like the previous game) – mixing legends and new pro talent. Tony touched on this in the same interview, along with the selection process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was trying to keep it modern obviously, whilst still respecting the legends that we had in the previous games, and also it was a matter of who was still actively skating, who was still in the scene. It's a delicate balance, but I'm really excited to have people like Chloe Covell, to have Rayssa from Brazil, and Andy Anderson."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skater and Jackass star <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/bam-margera-officially-confirmed-for-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Bam Magera also made it in at the late stages</a> of development, and so Tony "immediately hit up Activision" asking it to include him.

<p>Cracking down on piracy</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38585bf10eedc/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, a major Switch ROM site known as 'nsw2u' was seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>Now, we've got an official statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, highlighting the other sites seized. Here it is in full (via the official FBI website):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FBI Atlanta Seizes Major Video Game Piracy Websites</strong></p>
<div><p>The FBI's Atlanta Field Office announced today the seizure of several online criminal marketplaces providing pirated versions of popular video games.</p><p>

In addition to the seizure, the FBI has dismantled the infrastructure of these websites.</p><p>

For more than four years, the websites contained pirated copies of highly anticipated video games days or weeks before their official release date.</p><p>

Between February 28, 2025, and May 28, 2025, records indicate a total of 3.2 million downloads occurred on these sites from the most used download service. These actions resulting in an estimated loss of $170 million.</p><p>

As part of the actions announced today, the FBI has obtained authorization to seize the domain of multiple sites, to include nsw2u.com, nswdl.com, game-2u.com, bigngame.com, ps4pkg.com, ps4pkg.net, and mgnetu.com. These domains hosted and facilitated access to the pirated video games. Anyone visiting these sites will now view a seizure banner that notifies them the domain has been seized by federal authorities.</p></div></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rmjhqp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f9ec0e258b23/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is shaping up to be an excellent outing for DK, but the recent previews did highlight some performance concerns.</p>
<p>The game's director Kazuya Takahashi has now reportedly acknowledged these issues in a chat with the <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Spanish outlet Lavanguardia</a> – seemingly confirming these frame rate drops will be in the final build during more destructive moments of the game. For Nintendo, it was instead apparently about prioritising "fun and playability".</p>
<p>Here's Takahashi's full response (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-frame-rate-drops-director/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8jqyihv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>“There are several factors to consider. First, we intentionally used effects like hit-stop and slow motion to emphasize impacts. Second, because we use voxel technology, there are times when there are major changes and destruction in the environment. We’re aware that performance may drop slightly at these times. However, as you say, overall the game is smooth, and at points where large-scale changes occur, we prioritized fun and playability.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there will be some slight drops, as Takahashi mentions, the "overall" experience is still smooth.</p>
<p>In our recent preview of Donkey Kong Bananza, we noted how the experience in this new release felt a bit like a "TOTK situation" where the performance might not be perfect, but you forgive it for its ambition. So, if you're jumping into DK's new adventure on release and encounter changes in performance, don't be surprised.</p>
<p>We'll deliver our full review for Donkey Kong Bananza next week, so you can find out then how the final build performs.</p>

<p>Latency, performance and resolution investigated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>GameCube has joined the Switch 2's library of classic games, and it was recently updated with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. While the service's experience has been fun so far, there have also been some reports of underlying issues with the emulation.</p>
<p>Now, Digital Foundry has tested GameCube emulation and backward compatibility – investigating latency, analogue stick issues, frame drop issues on Switch 2, and resolution and performance improvements. The verdict is "certain details clearly need attending to by Nintendo".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For arcade-perfect accuracy in the likes of F-Zero GX, the extra input latency on Switch 2 should ideally be addressed, and likewise the sensitivity of those analogue sticks, the pattern of single frame drops in all games is also an obvious blemish but fundamentally the four games released on the GameCube classics page so far are faithfully represented."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows a video from game developer and YouTuber Modern Vintage Gamer about GameCube games on the Switch 2 – summing up the initial experience as "very good" but also having some "obvious" differences from the real experience.</p>
<p>To access this latest Switch Classics library, you'll need to have access to a Switch 2 and an active Expansion membership.</p>
