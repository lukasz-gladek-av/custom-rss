<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59bdf11a1b69a/mario-kart-world-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Japanese boxed charts are here, courtesy of <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44654">Famitsu</a>, and golly gosh, would you believe it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has stormed to the top with a total of 782,566 copies sold. That's simply incredible.</p>
<p>The next in line is the Switch 1 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> with 45,703 copies sold. Truth be told, we're a little surprised that MK World wasn't immediately followed up by another Switch 2 game, but it seems the vast majority of buyers have opted for Nintendo's latest flagship title and left it at that. There's always digital sales to account for too, of course.</p>
<p>That said, both <strong>Zelda</strong> titles on Switch 2 have made the top ten, along with the Switch 2 version of Rune Factory and, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at this week's Japanese top 10:</p>

<hr>
<p>With hardware this week, as expected, the Switch 2 is off to a roaring start in Japan, but we weren't prepared for just <em>how</em> successful it would be. The console has sold a whopping 947,931 consoles at launch.</p>
<p>This means that the Switch 2 is comfortably the fastest-selling console in Japan of all time, smashing the previous record of 630,552 set by the almighty PlayStation 2. Similarly, the GBA managed to sell 611,000, the DS 468,000, and the original Switch 330,637.</p>
<p>To put this into further perspective, the Switch 2 has already outsold the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X Digital Edition, <em>and</em> the PlayStation 5 Pro combined. It's also almost outsold the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition too, though it's still a little way off surpassing the standard disc version.</p>
<p>We imagine these numbers will only continue to skyrocket in the coming weeks, so long as Nintendo maintains decent stock, and frankly we can't wait to see where the Switch 2 ends up by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Here's your look at the latest Japanese hardware sales in full:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/poppy_playtime_chapter_1">Poppy Playtime</a> is one of those strange video game phenomenon, in this writer's experience at least, that seems to be a pretty big hit with younger players, even though it's a proper creepy-ass horror game. There are toys of this franchise everywhere, and we've even got a movie on the way. And, it has the vibe of something that's fallen out of Roblox, too.</p>
<p>It'll come as some very good news to fans of Mob Entertainment's series, then, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/poppy_playtime_chapter_4">Poppy Playtime Chapter 4</a> (the 4th chapter in the Poppy Playtime saga lest you're confused) drops onto consoles - including that there Nintendo Switch - on <strong>June 25th</strong>.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Poppy Playtime, you see, is set in an abandoned toy factory that's full of very nasty toys who are set on making life unsettling for you, a factory worker who needs to get the heck out of there. Cue lots of creepy doll stuff that probably isn't really all that suitable for young kids, actually.</p>

<p>This 4th entry, entitled "Safe Haven" continues the nightmare, with a fairly large cast of characters to meet as you work through its puzzles and utilise its gadgets.</p>
<p>Chapters 1-3 of Poppy Playtime have been well received by players over time, and although this 4th chapter has already been released to somewhat disappointing (in comparison) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008670/Poppy_Playtime__Chapter_4/">reviews on PC</a>, there's still been enough love that we're sure fans will be very interested in picking it up.</p>
<p>Now, that June 25th release date gives us just enough time to get some clean underwear in, as we're actually fairly terrified of some of the dead-eyed, ghoulish toys in the game's fresh new console launch trailer...</p>
