<p>Very few headlines have sent a shiver down our spines quite like this one, but yes, you read that correctly. Over 20 years after the release of <strong>Kill Bill Vol. 2</strong>, Quentin Tarantino has returned to write and direct one final chapter in the film's chronology... and it's premiering in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>"Quentin Tarantino had a dream of a Kill Bill chapter that never made it to the silver screen, a chapter known as 'Yuki’s Revenge'," the caption to the newly-released teaser trailer above reads. "Over 20 years later, Tarantino and Epic have come together to bring the story to life in Fortnite".</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch the short film, fully animated in the Fortnite engine and starring Uma Thurman (yes, <em>the</em> Uma Thurman), in Fortnite on <strong>30th November</strong> at <strong>7pm GMT / 8pm CET / 2pm, ET / 11am PT</strong>. Alternatively, you can catch it in cinemas during the upcoming screenings of <strong>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</strong> from 5th December.</p>
<p>Those who purchase a ticket to the film's opening weekend will receive a code for Yuki's Gogo Yubari outfit, which can also be unlocked in-game from 27th Nov - 1st Dec.</p>

<p>Fortnite has played host to all kinds of big music events over the years, but the premiere of a new Quentin Tarantino joint (albeit an animated short)? That's <em>wild</em>.</p>
<p>Those who have watched <strong>Kill Bill</strong> will know that it's no family-friendly affair, and while the teaser for the Fortnite short looks like things will be toned down a little (there's only so much peril and gore you can show with an anthropomorphised banana in the background), there's something about the combination of <em>this</em> film and <em>this</em> game that just feels... <em>eeeehh</em>.</p>
<p>Either way, for the Tarantino completionists who want to get in on his latest project early, we'll see you on the Battle Bus. Gosh, what a world we live in.</p>

<figure data-uuid="0bb4ac7f3e954"><a title="Nintendo Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bb4ac7f3e954/nintendo-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will acquire a majority stake in Bandai Namco Studios Singapore after reaching an agreement with Bandai Namco for the transfer of shares next year.</p>
<p>Described in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html">the press release</a> as being "for the purpose of strengthening its development structure," BNSS will become a Nintendo subsidiary and go by the new name of Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>
<p>The deal is planned to go through on 1st April 2026, with Nintendo acquiring 80% of shares, with the rest to follow some time after "once the subsidiary’s operations have stabilized."</p>
<p>Nintendo has partnered with Bandai Namco on several first-party projects, with this studio having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> (contributing concept art, character modelling, environment modelling, and animation, according to <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/news/games/splatoon-3/">the studio's website</a>) as well as various high-profile Bandai Namco games. Here's a description of the studio from <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/">Bandai Namco's site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years, our studio in Singapore has worked on a variety of iconic game titles such as TEKKEN, ACE COMBAT, SOUL CALIBUR and Taiko no Tatsujin. From concept to art, and all the way to development, we cover it all. Explore our portfolio of game and demo titles by selecting any of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo anticipates that the acquisition "will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year."</p>
<p>This latest acquisition follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-states-its-intention-to-acquire-more-development-teams">acknowledgement earlier in November</a> that the company intended to expand its internal development teams. Nintendo Pictures was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/nintendo-publishes-job-listings-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">another addition in 2022</a>, followed by Shiver Entertainment's integration <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/shiver-entertainment-has-updated-its-website-after-being-acquired-by-nintendo">in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 2011, the DS was gifted one of the all-time great <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alien_isolation">Alien</a> franchise games in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/aliens_infestation">Aliens: Infestation</a>, a slick and polished Metroidvania that nails its mix of puzzling, platforming, signature series tension, and great big scary extraterrestrials (alongside their face-hugging pals). Hey, we even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2011/10/aliens_infestation_ds">gave it an 8/10 back at release</a>, so you just know it's verified fresh, or whatever they're saying these days.</p>
<p>It's a very good game that you should definitely play, in short. Even if you don't like Metroidvanias or aliens. Because of one song.</p>
<p>As we were happily reminded this very morning, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social/post/3m6lqhazfs22a">via a much-appreciated social media post,</a> of the ending credits song for Aliens: Infestation (below), written by the very same band (Guyz Nite) who penned the also wonderful <a href="https://youtu.be/dH34jMqHBmw?si=9ZQDc0uf6d8PkmUg">Die Hard song</a> (warning for NSFW swearing, but otherwise a treat and a wonderful Xmas song to boot).</p>

<p>If you can listen to this and somehow resist immediately diving back in to replay the whole flipping game all over again, you've got more willpower than this writer. And shoutout to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social">@MrHallenback</a> for the Thursday morning levity!</p>
