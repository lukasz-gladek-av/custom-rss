<p>Eat your heart out, Red Dead</p>

<p>During today's Opening Night Live showcase for Gamescom, Nightdive Studios confirmed its latest release: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + A Handful of Missions: Remaster</a>.</p>
<p>Originally launched in 1997 and built with LucasArts' Jedi engine, Outlaws received positive acclaim for its soundtrack and gameplay, though gained some criticism for its somewhat lacklustre visuals. Nightdive's remaster, much like its previous efforts, looks to revitalise the game for the modern era, with twin-stick gameplay and gyro support included as standard.</p>
<p>Again, like the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, there's no native Switch 2 version, so the 4K/120fps performance touted for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S won't apply to the Switch release. That said, Nightdive is remarkably adept at optimising its games, so you can probably expect a rock-solid 60fps for Outlaws on Nintendo's previous-gen console.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Engaging first-person ground combat featuring five weapon types</p>
<p>- Up to 4K 120FPS visuals on PC, PlayStation 4|5, and Xbox One and Series X|S</p>
<p>- Modern gamepad support adds a new weapon wheel, rumble, and motion/gyro controls</p>
<p>- Trophies and Achievements on Windows PC via Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles</p>
<p>- A Vault filled with golden behind-the-scenes nuggets that fans will enjoy</p>
<p>- Four Multiplayer game modes with crossplay across platforms — Deathmatch, Team Play, Capture the Flag, and Kill The Fool With The Chicken!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster is scheduled to launch later this year. We'll keep you informed of any latest developments, including the final release date, as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>Hades II, Silksong, and Pokémon all playable, too</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59ec8a9063c29/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Nintendo has confirmed its line-up for PAX West in Seattle, Washington — which kicks off in 10 days time. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which just got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">an extensive Nintendo Direct</a>, is getting its first public demo.</p>
<p>Outside of the upcoming racing game, the line-up is relatively similar to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/metroid-prime-4-elden-ring-silksong-all-playable-at-nintendos-gamescom-booth">Gamescom</a> one, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> , <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> among the games attendees will be able to check out.</p>
<p>However, for Kirby and Pokémon — you'll need to get a Warp Pipe Pass reservation. You'll be able to register for this on <strong>21st August 2025 at 9am PDT</strong> (that's 12pm EDT for those on the east coast).</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2vlyquw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf32irwF2Do" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The rest of the games, however, will be available to play to all. Here's the full line-up, then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii"><strong>Hades II</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kirby Air Riders</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also swing by the My Nintendo check-in area if you're there and get yourself 100 Platinum Points if you check-in with your Nintendo Account, plus enter a giveaway.</p>
<p>So that's a pretty healthy list of games — and all games that are coming to Switch 2, too. Kirby Air Riders now has a release date, but by the time PAX rolls around, perhaps Hades aII and Silksong will, as well?</p>

<p>Geoff! Geoff! Geoff!</p>
</section></header><section>
<p>Two watch posts in one day? What is this madness?? With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct in the rear-view mirror, it's time to move on to the <em>second</em> showcase of the day: GamesCom Opening Night Live.</p>
<p>Yes, we are mere minutes away from the grand opening of the huge gaming expo, and <em>the</em> Geoff Keighley is back to guide us through an evening of news and announcements — some of which might even be for Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The event kicks off at <strong>7pm BST / 11am PDT / 2pm EDT / 8pm CEST</strong> and promises roughly <em>two hours</em> of reveals. Those in for the long run can find the full showcase streamed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHo_GVNoKNqfJx6zUGRd6YQ" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, or you can watch along with us via the feed below, so we can all have a natter in the meantime.</p>
<p>All of that is right around the corner, so make sure you're sitting comfortably, because it's almost Geoff o'clock!</p>
