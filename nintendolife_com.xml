<p>New update incoming</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="fdaa5c68f79f6"><a title="Fallout 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdaa5c68f79f6/fallout-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is now officially available on the Switch 2, and it seems Bethesda won't be wasting any time when it comes to updates.</p>
<p>In a confirmation via social media, it has revealed it will bolster the post-apocalyptic experience with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-what-is-dlss-nvidias-deep-learning-super-sampling-explained">support for DLSS</a> and by also providing "additional stability improvements". This update will join the 60fps and 40fps modes, which are already in the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bethesda:</strong> Thank you to everyone who has already jumped in to explore the Commonwealth on Nintendo Switch 2!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>In addition to our current 60fps and 40fps modes we'll be adding the following in an upcoming update:<br>
- Support for DLSS<br>
- Additional stability improvements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this improves the overall experience and irons out any bugs present in the launch build. There's no mention about when exactly this next update will be released, but it's nice to see Bethesda at least providing players with a heads up, especially after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>'s bumpy start on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This release of Fallout 4 on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware follows last week's update for The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, which added visual and performance modes. If you want to see both of these games in action, be sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/X9yfk_TCAUE">our YouTube channel</a>. We've also got a Fallout 4 review on the way.</p>

<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="5c582cec1f55a"><a title="Gran Turismo 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c582cec1f55a/gran-turismo-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PlayStation</em></figcaption></figure><p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7">Gran Turismo 7</a> has apparently been linked to the Switch 2 in a wild new rumour, but it doesn't necessarily mean what you might be thinking.</p>
<p>This information comes from video game journalist Jeff Grubb, who recently responded to a fan on his show, asking a question about "the real driving simulator" and the possibility of it racing on to another platform.</p>
<p>While there was a fair amount of speculation on Grubb's end about <em>other</em> Sony franchises during this segment, in terms of Gran Turismo, he claims he's actually heard about a Switch 2 version, but doesn't expect anything to come of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeff Grubb:</strong> "I heard recently that Gran Turismo was running on the Switch 2. I don't think it's going to come to the Switch 2, but I heard it was running on it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, why would Sony bother to get a game like this up and running on the Switch 2, but not even consider a release?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1reac3w/jeff_grubb_playstation_had_gran_turismo_7_running/">One popular theory</a> seems to be it's testing the waters <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sony-allegedly-encouraging-devs-to-use-ps5s-new-low-power-mode-prompting-fresh-ps6-handheld-speculation?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">as rumours circulate</a> about the company potentially releasing a new PlayStation handheld. In other words, this could be research and development, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Gaming enthusiasts online have also pointed out how companies over the years <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2020/05/gears_of_war_ps3_footage_appears_online_epic_games_comments">got titles up and running on certain platforms</a>, but never went any further. If this is more than a rumour, it wouldn't necessarily be the first time we've heard about something like this.</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/for-some-reason-sony-apparently-got-gran-turismo-7-running-on-switch-2">friends at Push Square</a> further note, Switch 2's primary controllers <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-with-analogue-trigger-compatibility-that-work-with-the-gamecube-nso-controller">don't have analogue triggers</a> and the system doesn't offer "robust" steering wheel support, all of which is considered essential to experience Gran Turismo "at its best".</p>
<p>Of course, if there are any significant developments, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

<p>Last May, an Xbox Wire post announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_dolphin">Ecco The Dolphin</a> would be making a comeback with a remaster of not only the first game, but also the sequel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_tides_of_time">Tides of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Platforms weren't mentioned at the time, but a new two-page spread for the remaster in Famitsu this week lists the Switch - seemingly confirming the remaster is on its way to Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Additional details have also been shared by the series creator Ed Annunziata in this feature. As highlighted by Nintendo Everything, the plan is to include 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit versions in a single package, and allow players to swap between visual styles in "real-time".</p>
<p>The final name of this project is still being decided, but the favourite at the moment appears to be "Ecco Complete". Of course, this is all subject to localisation changes.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, these remasters will also be joined by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/ecco-the-dolphin-is-making-a-comeback-with-remasters-and-new-game">"new, third game"</a> at some stage. More updates related to Ecco are expected to take place this April, according to an <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">official Ecco the Dolphin countdown website</a>.</p>
<p>As we've previously mentioned, the original Ecco the Dolphin game, which launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, is playable via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>

<p>New marriage candidates, pre-release footage and more</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The indie success story <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is today celebrating its 10th anniversary. As part of this, the game's creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has announced a special video broadcast.</p>
<p>It will apparently run for "about 23 minutes", and fans can expect to see some "pre-release footage" as well as the reveal of the new 1.7 marriage candidates at the end. Barone actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valley-creator-teases-two-more-marriage-candidates-for-update-1-7">teased this upcoming reveal</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what you can expect to see and hear about during the anniversary broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ConcernedApe:</strong> "I made a video for tomorrow's 10-year Stardew Valley Anniversary, it will "premiere" tomorrow at 11am PST...I go over some old builds of the game w/ commentary, briefly go over the many updates, give a special message to the players, and reveal the 2 new marriage candidates in 1.7."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What time is the Stardew Valley 10-Year anniversary video premiere?</h3>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 11am PST / 12pm MST / 1pm CST / 2pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 7pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 8pm CET / 9pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 4am (Thu) JST / 3am (Thu) AWST / 6am (Thu) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>To date, this hugely popular farming and lifestyle sim has now sold millions of copies worldwide and it's been updated over the years with a lot of free content.</p>
<p>Most recently, the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-now-available">made available for the Switch 2</a>. This version hasn't been released in every region just yet, but Barone mentioned last week that the Switch 2 Edition (and free upgrade for existing players) would be coming to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valleys-new-update-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-live">European and Japanese eShop in "a few weeks"</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The physical distributor Limited Run Games is teaming up with Marvel and Konami to revive multiple retro games in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection"><strong>Marvel</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection">Maximum Collection</a></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>This superhero-sized collection, "coming soon" to Switch and other platforms, will feature six "classic titles" spanning across the Arcade, 8-bit and 16-bit consoles.</p>
<p>The collection covers multiple genres and promises to take fans on a "comprehensive tour" of Marvel's gaming legacy. It won't just feature one version of a particular title, either - it offers "every major console and arcade iteration" available.</p>
<p>Here are the titles included in this new collection, with rollback netcode also confirmed for X-Men: The Arcade Game.</p>
<p><strong>X-Men: The Arcade Game (Arcade)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definitive mutant beat-’em-up returns! Experience the legendary cabinet action with full online multiplayer support for up to six players. Choose your favorite X-Man and take on Magneto’s army with the ultimate team-up experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Captain America and The Avengers (Arcade, Sega® Genesis/Mega Drive, NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take control of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Vision as you experience the cinematic arcade original or the unique platforming spin of the NES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/Venom: Maximum Carnage (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the iconic comic crossover, gamers take to the streets of NYC battling hordes of nefarious bad guys, all to the sound of a rockin’ 16-bit soundtrack! Switch between the rich color palette of the Super Nintendo version, or dive in and enjoy the Genesis/Mega Drive version’s gritty vibe. Whatever you choose, carnage is guaranteed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The superlative symbiote sequel! Go solo or team up in two-player co-op to take on the Life Foundation and Carnage’s offspring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade’s Revenge (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Boy™, Game Gear™)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Navigate Arcade’s deadly "Murderworld." This collection includes the handheld versions of the game, offering a fascinating look at Marvel's history of on-the-go gaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Silver Surfer (NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test your Super Hero skills against one of the most infamously challenging shooters to ever grace a console! Featuring one of the greatest soundtracks in 8-bit history, this is a shooter that’s tough to master and tougher to put down!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Limited Run notes how this collection will feature "all new music from the legendary game composer Chris Huelsbeck".</p>
<p>As usual with collections like this, you can also look forward to a host of features designed to scratch that retro "itch". This includes a digital archive (featuring box art, instruction manuals and more), a music player (including scores for every version of every game in the collection), rewind &amp; save states, cheat menus, and display options - allowing you to relive the CRT days.</p>


<p>When we find out more about this collection, we'll let you know.
