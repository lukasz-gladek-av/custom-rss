<p>According to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/DAVE-THE-DIVER-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2957273.html">eShop listing</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition offers "higher resolution and improved frame rates", while the content of the game remains unchanged between the consoles. Dave's diving escapades didn't feel like they <em>needed</em> a boost in this department, but smoother swimming is always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>Those with Dave the Diver on Switch 1 can upgrade to this new version for free. Alternatively, you can pick up the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> (a discount on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> brings that down to $11.99 until 13th November).</p>
<p>Developer Mintrocket teased that the update would be coming "soon" back in June, so it's nice to see that promise finally materialise.</p>
<p>We awarded Dave the Diver an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dave-the-diver">our review</a>, calling it one of the few 2023 games "that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". If you still haven't dived in, now might be a good excuse to do so.</p>

<p>"They're just speaking the language of video games"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Dan Houser, former GTA boss and co-founder of Rockstar Games, recently took to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMTU7xLbSrw">Lex Fridman Podcast</a> to talk about his personal history and the games industry at large (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/former-gta-boss-dan-houser-says-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-or-the-kingdom-are-like-alfred-hitchcock-films-theyre-just-speaking-the-language-of-video-games/">Games Radar+</a>).</p>
<p>The conversation soon turned to Nintendo when the pair began to speak about early 3D games. Fridman notes that Nintendo has a particular level of polish in which "every pixel has a purpose", with the company expertly "delivering a pure gaming experience".</p>
<p>Houser agreed, and when they got onto the more recent open-world Zelda entries – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> – he states that they "feel like [Alfred] Hitchcock" in their design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The new ones, they almost, to me, feel like Hitchcock. They're just speaking the language of video games. You know, like, you know everything's going to work this way and that way – it's quite systemic, but how it all glues together is so amazing.</p>
<p>"It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality, he's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong accent. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all.</p>
<p>"And that's what those Zelda games kinda feel like to me. They are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything else."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems a pretty apt comparison to us! Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have certainly earned their fair share of praise over the years, but this might be the first time we've heard them compared to Hitchcock – it certainly makes sense, though.</p>
<p>Dan Houser is, of course, no longer at Rockstar Games, which itself is gearing up to launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> in 2026. Houser went on to form Absurd Ventures with an aim to create new IP across video games, books, movies, comics, and more.</p>

<p>The film's listing on the <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> (FTIA) website has seen a status update this week, with the former "Pre-Production" stamp changing to the much more promising "In Production" — that's what we like to see.</p>
<p>The main filming location is listed on the site as Wellington, New Zealand, a common spot for bringing fantasy lands to the big screen, as previously used for <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> trilogy, <strong>Avatar</strong> and <strong>King Kong</strong>.</p>
<p>The FTIA provides the following project summary for the upcoming movie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness. The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce—an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, we've known for a while that the Zelda movie would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/rumour-zelda-live-action-movie-will-reportedly-be-part-of-a-trilogy1">shooting in New Zealand</a> in November 2025, but it's exciting to see that production status change!</p>
<p>The film is set to release on 7th May 2027 — assuming there are no more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">delays</a>. The only casting that we know of so far is <strong>Renegade Nell</strong>'s Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda and <strong>The Haunting of Bly Manor</strong>'s Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link, but we'd be surprised if we don't get a few more face reveals in the next year or so.</p>
