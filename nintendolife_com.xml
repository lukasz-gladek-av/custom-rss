            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="c8acb7e9785f2"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8acb7e9785f2/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the reasons I adore N64-gen Rare so much is because they loved testing the boundaries. What could they get away with in a cheeky, charming 3D platformer? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> was already dipping its toe in the water in a few subtle (and less-subtle) ways. “How's your nuts, bark breath?” is funny, but perhaps funnier with that adult context. And the 1998 platformer was more than ready to get a little bit scary – did anyone else freak out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-which-scary-video-game-moments-gave-you-nightmares-as-a-kid">the first time they saw Clanker</a>? No?</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-tooie">Banjo-Tooie</a> pushes things to a whole new level. It rips the band-aid off and tosses it off of a steep cliff into the volcano of Hailfire Peaks, almost with complete disregard for what came before it. Rare is unafraid to tell you that this is a <em>very</em> different game tonally from the first. In fact, growing up, it was one of the scariest games I’d played. I still feel that way 25 years later. And I love it, warts and all, for that reason.</p>
<p>I should’ve known immediately something was different. While Banjo-Kazooie got a chirpy, cheerful intro song with the cast all playing the main theme together, Tooie just gets a slower, lower-pitch version playing as a camera pans over the abandoned Gruntilda’s Lair. Rare could’ve brought Grunty back as the green same, except she’s a walking skeleton.</p>
<figure data-uuid="14561ec8a88a2"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14561ec8a88a2/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and just 20 minutes into the game, Grunty has murdered Bottles the mole by burning him to a crisp <em>and</em> turned King Jingaling into a zombie, who groans and attacks Banjo on sight. I stupidly left Banjo waiting inside the zombified throne room one time and remember hearing the king’s moaning as it pecked Banjo and Kazooie to death. I was but a simple eight-year-old, I didn’t expect previously friendly NPCs to be hostile, even if they were a walking corpse!</p>
<p>So much about Banjo-Tooie is bleak and disturbing, but the intro and the first few sections of the Isle O’ Hags really set the tone; the abandoned Jinjo Village where the HAG-1 tracks has ploughed right through one of the houses, is harrowing the first time you walk through it, made worse by the cheerful music. Walking into Bottles’ house and <em>hiding</em> the fact the patriarch of the family has passed away made me feel sick.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee582e6c9015"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee582e6c9015/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things don’t get any better when you start to explore any of the worlds, either. Mayahem Temple might be one of the gentler worlds on the nightmare fuel front, but something about Ssslumber the Snake always made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Maybe it’s because I had to do that darn sneaking section at least a dozen times, but those teeth are a little too big for my liking. And the Snapdragons that chomp at you while you’re gripping onto a ledge? No thank you.</p>
<p>Glitter Gulch Mine is where things start to ramp up again. If the toxic gas room where Banjo and Kazooie can choke to death isn’t enough (seriously, what is <em>up</em> with N64 drowning animations?), then how about the pitch-black generator room or the Power Hut where one wrong step means a fall to your death?</p>

<p>The level variety is much darker than it ever was in the original; sunny beaches are now replaced with a sprawling lagoon where terrifying sea creatures lurk deep underwater. There’s no room for swamps and crocodiles here, as giant lizards and amphibians roam the lands of Terrydactyland. And even though Rusty Bucket Bay might fill my heart with fear, the oil-slicked waters have nothing on Grunty Industries’ sprawling maze of a building, with abandoned electrics, dangerous traps, and a sentient welding torch that drags itself through a duct like a snake, with gnashing teeth to boot.</p>
<p>I have no idea who designed the bosses in Banjo-Tooie <em>[Ah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/feature_banjo-tooie_turns_20_-_the_rare_team_tells_the_story_of_bombs_bugs_and_bottles">do I have an article for you!</a> - Ed.]</em>, but hats off to you – almost all of them have some shudder-worthing component to them. Targitzan's jewelled eyes mean the gigantic statue remains unblinking. Mingy Jongo is a complete rug-pull, tricking you into thinking he’s Mumbo Jumbo before attacking you mid-cutscene, with the encounter acting as a big T-800 reference.</p>

<p>The freakiest to me, besides pitting Banjo and Kazooie up against a gigantic drill at the end of the game, is Mr. Patch, the inflatable dinosaur in Witchyworld. Again, who decides to give the blow-up dino blow-up teeth? This should be a fairly innocent ‘creature’, but the combination of the huge, empty big top, the weird sneezing noise and hissing, and the difficulty of controlling and aiming Kazooie’s eggs while flying, has always made my palms sweaty.</p>
<p>In fact, Witchworld itself really seems to understand what kids are afraid of. Theme parks are meant to be fun, but clowns, crowds, and loud noises also come part and parcel with these places. These are three things I <em>didn’t</em> like when I was younger. So, throw me into an abandoned theme park and I’m instantly going to be unnerved.</p>
<figure data-uuid="f9c0beaee5d3e"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f9c0beaee5d3e/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s probably my favourite world in the game as a result; the music has echoes of delight, but is empty and haunting. The skies are blood red, and the fences around the park rusted; the food is gross, and the employees tired, grumpy, and rude. It’s the antithesis of a fun fair. Even the mascots attack you!</p>
<p>The thing is, a lot of these scares were projected in Banjo-Kazooie, but it was much gentler about creeping you out (for the most part – I don’t think I’ll ever stay calm when I touch the water in Treasure Trove Cove and Snacker starts chasing me). Tooie just leans into more of those adult tendencies, <em>barely</em> getting away with some of the more lewd stuff in most cases.</p>
<p>But as funny as Tooie is, and as messy as it can be as a sequel, it’s those creepy moments that have stuck with me for the past quarter of a century. Running from Stomponadon as he tries to squash the bear and bird is heart-pounding, and the first time I ran into a Minjo I panicked.</p>

<p>Essentially, if Banjo-Kazooie is a cheeky little kid testing the boundaries, Banjo-Tooie is the messy teenager ready to prank and scare you around every corner. Sometimes, it’s pure nightmare fuel. But I wouldn’t change it for the world.</p>

There's a new <strong>Momotaro Dentetsu</strong> game in town, and it's another smash hit.</p>
<p>The Japanese exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/momotaro_dentetsu_2_anata_no_machi_mo_kitto_aru_-_higashi_nihon_hen_plus_nishi_nihon_hen">Momotaro Dentetsu 2: Anata no Machi mo Kitto Aru – Higashi Nihon Hen + Nishi Nihon Hen</a> has arrived with a bang on Switch and Switch 2, snatching up first and third spots on the software charts with a combined first week total of 147,513 sales. <em>Oof</em>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2lojxyh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>If you've been following these charts for a while, you'll remember that Konami's first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/momotaro_dentetsu_showa_heisei_reiwa_mo_teiban">Momotaro Dentetsu</a> board game took Japan by storm back in late 2020, even beating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> to the top spot — these <strong>Hyrule Warriors</strong> games can't catch a break against the Japan-exclusive series, can they?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> managed to sneak in and grab second place, but this all means that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, last week's champion, has fallen to sixth.</p>
<p>Things are rounded out by newbies <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking!

<p>Of course, all of those Momotaro Dentetsu sales have to go somewhere, and the hardware chart has shown booming numbers for the Switch 2 — shifting over 100,000 units this week. The rest of the order remains unchanged, with the three Switch SKUs combining for 22,736 sales, while the trio of PS5 models total in at 5,855.</p>

<p>THQ Nordic and Tarsier Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2129530/view/613180506112000708">have announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>13th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The highly-anticipated spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a> (which was also handled by Tarsier Studios before handing the reins over to Supermassive Games for the third entry) will also gain a free demo in the coming weeks, just in case you want to try it out yourself before opting for the full game.</p>
<p>A $59.99 Digital Deluxe Edition will be available on launch, and this will include the base game, Season Pass, and the exclusive Foxhead and Muttonhead masks. Tarsier has also stressed that while this is primarily a co-op experience, solo players can also experience the game, with an AI taking on the role of your companion.</p>
<p>It looks awesome, and we genuinely can't wait to dive in. For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Horror With Hope</strong> – In this unsettling tale, the emphasis is on tension and thick atmosphere, as you join the two orphans on a desperate search for hope and redemption in the direst of circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>- Across a Dark and Twisted World</strong> – Traverse an intriguing but terrifying world, where the main path is only one part of the fragmented story. Discover all sorts of mysterious locations on your perilous journey, each with its own story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>- A Dread-Filled Adventure</strong> – Tarsier Studios is bringing their unique visual style to bear on a whole host of new twisted monsters and broken, yet resilient, child characters. Fragments of the children’s troubled past have been used as inspiration for their character design, and for the monsters that now torment them.</p>
<p><strong>- Share the Scare</strong> – Nobody should be forced to go through hell alone! Fully playable in single player and local and online cooperative play, <em>REANIMAL</em> has a shared, directed camera, designed to maximize claustrophobia and tension.</p>
</blockquote>
