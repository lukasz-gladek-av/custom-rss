<p>Following an update earlier this month, Toby Fox's latest game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> has now been updated to Version 1.03.</p>
<p>This latest update includes improvements to Chapter 2, 3 and 4, along with various other changes. This includes multiple fixes across each chapter, including some softlock fixes, and there are also some fixes tied to minor graphical errors.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/deltarune-1-02-update-out-now-patch-notes/" rel="noopener">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<h3>Deltarune Version 1.03</h3>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<ul>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a softlock in the part where you catch mice in a basket on your head.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Swords used in a certain boss’s “Sword Tunnel” attack now have a reduced hit box relative to the graphic, making the attack easier to dodge.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock on the Board 1 that could occur after using only three keys.</li>
<li>Fixed a soft lock if a party member fails to reach the Power Croissant.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash if you pushed a pyramid the wrong way.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where on certain platforms, the sprites of the game would become blurry after the Tenna scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<ul>
<li>If you lose to Jackenstein 2 times in a row, the amount of damage that the chasing pumpkin deals will be halved. If you lose 3 times in a row, TP gain will be increased by 50%. These changes will allow players who find this battle difficult to progress past it more easily.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock which could occur if the tutu was not returned to you.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where normal battle music would not play if you fought Mike at the beginning of the game. (This issue becomes resolved after fighting Jackenstein.)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with a hitbox not working when a boss dives at you from many different directions. (The hitbox will be adjusted more later)</li>
<li>Fixed an impossible note on the song “Knock you Down!!” in the rhythm game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Kris would still appear to be wearing their church clothes even though they’d been removed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where asking Ralsei advice for a puzzle would simply result in him saying a single button.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing octaves on the giant piano organ thing could freeze the game.</li>
<li>Susie and Ralsei no longer erroneously appear in the rhythm game at Castle Town at the end of the Chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various Chapters</p>
<ul>
<li>[Console-only] Fixed an issue where changing the language setting would also change the border setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the intro prophecy would always be skipped after selecting a chapter using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed a few minor textual errors.</li>
<li>Fixed various minor graphical errors.</li>
<li>Various other minor fixes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Following the launch of Mario Kart World</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Toadette" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ddc951ecba813/toadette.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, it's clear the restrictions on the voice actor reveals for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> have officially lifted at this point, and more of the talent is now revealing who they played in the Switch 2 launch title.</p>
<p>Following the update on Peach yesterday (and also who voiced the NPC Toads in the game), we've now got the confirmation of the main Toad's voice actor. This character is played by Laila Berzins and was formerly voiced by Samantha Kelly.</p>
<p>Berzin's officially confirmed this in an announcement on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am overjoyed to be able to finally announce that I voice Toad in MarioKartWorld. Being a part of such an iconic franchise, let alone one of my favorite characters is a dream come true.</p>
<p>I am so inspired by the magnificient Toads before me; Jen Taylor and Samantha Kelley. The gaming community owes them a huge debt of gratitude for the years they've spent bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>I hope to do this little mushroom proud! He’s a fun guy! Get it? Fungi? Anyway…Immensely grateful to Nintendo America and cupofteastudios. “Here we go!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, Laura Stahl has confirmed she's playing Toadette in Mario Kart World. Here's what she had to say about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"peeking out of a social media hiatus to share that I am the voice of Toadette in mariokartworld! grateful to Cupofteaprod and NintendoAmerica for the opportunity! im still in disbelief, and so, so grateful"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see the names of all these voice actors in the Mario Kart World credits, although their specific character roles are not listed.</p>

<p>Update: Ubisoft CEO says it's coming to "other machines"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e18eb17f5942/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-23T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 23rd Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has apparently hinted at <strong>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong> for the Switch 2 in the company's latest quarterly earnings call.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">highlighted by IGN</a>, in a conversation with an investor regarding this title, Guillemot mentioned how there will be "some new versions" of this title "that will come on other machines".</p>
<p>Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet appeared to support this, noting how there will be another game "launched on the Switch 2" (seemingly within the current fiscal year) and this will be "beyond the announced releases" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>).</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 19th Apr, 2025 14:45 BST]</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft was already rumoured to be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-ubisoft-has-more-than-half-a-dozen-games-planned-for-switch-2">multiple titles to the Switch 2</a>, so what else might we see beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>?</p>
<p>According to a new listing on PEGI's website, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> is on the way to Nintendo's hybrid successor. You can see this on the home page of the site, but when you click through to the rating, there's no mention of a Nintendo version (<em>at least yet</em>).</p>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d2d49997b76d/assassins-creed-shadows.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life, PEGI</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new entry in Ubisoft's long-running series was released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms in March 2025 and received a 'PEGI 18' rating for violence and in-game purchases. Here's the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111337">official description</a> of PEGI's rating:</p>
<h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advice for consumers</strong> This game has received a PEGI 18 which restricts availability to ADULTS ONLY and is not suitable for persons under 18 years of age. This rating has been given because it features graphic violence, violence against vulnerable and defenceless characters, and motiveless killing of innocent characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Brief outline of the game</strong> Action role-playing game, set in ancient feudal Japan, following two protagonists: Naoe, a young female shinobi, and an African samurai, Yasuke.</p>
<p><strong>Content specific issues</strong> This game contains depictions of graphic violence to human characters. It is possible to decapitate or dismember enemies, using bladed weapons. There are also examples of violence towards vulnerable and defenceless characters. Players may encounter hostage situations, where enemy groups line up bound civilians and execute them. Players are additionally able to kill multiple innocent civilians in towns and cities.</p>
<p><strong>Other issues</strong> This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items, in the form of cosmetic bundles and a premium in-game currency called Helix Credits, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are depictions of the Japanese form of ritualised suicide, seppuku, in which characters take their own lives using a blade. This occurs in the historical context of a game set in feudal Japan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest development follows Ubisoft confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration">Star Wars Outlaws will be arriving for the Switch 2</a> on 4th September 2025. A new trailer has also been revealed for this game's second "story pack" DLC.</p>
