<p>Mario Kart cleans up (again) while Metroid drops</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026</a> slipped out of the top 10 (the latter out of the top 40 completely) to make room for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grand_theft_auto_v">GTA5</a>, both of which were hovering just outside last week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> moves down from #17 to #32, with over three-quarters of sales being for the Switch 2 Edition. And the Zeldas <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> are hanging in there at #37 and #40, respectively.</p>
<p>Here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1e704260b7671"><a title="2026 Predictions 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e704260b7671/2026-predictions-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, it seems like only yesterday we were looking ahead at Nintendo's 2025 with a sense of unwavering optimism, and now here we are – it's certainly been a year. The Switch 2 finally arrived, bringing with it a plethora of goodwill and controversy alike, ushering in a new generation that, if initial sales are anything to go by, might be one of Nintendo's most successful yet.</p>
<p>It's still early days, mind you, but we've no doubt that 2026 is going to be an equally busy year for Nintendo (and for us, too), so it's time we look ahead at the upcoming 12 months and see what might be in store.</p>
<p>Naturally, now that the big hardware release is out of the way, we're going to be focusing mainly on the <em>games</em> here, but we'll also throw a bone to Nintendo's non-gaming business, which seems to be ramping up more and more with each passing year.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:181925 @ 1767021196 -->
<p>So without further ado, let's live right in with a look at first-party Nintendo games...</p>
<h2>Switch 2 First-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e203fb172b109"><a title="2026 Predictions 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e203fb172b109/2026-predictions-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> I think it's about time we see <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-where-should-luigis-mansion-4-take-place">Luigi's Mansion 4</a></strong>, wouldn't you agree? It's been over six years since the third game, and given that it's sold nearly 15 million copies at this point, I think a new entry would be an easy win for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Then again, if Luigi's gets the spotlight, does that mean we go <em>another</em> year without a new 3D Mario? I'm not sure how I'd feel about that. I'm confident that Nintendo will reveal at least one of these in the coming months. I'd be equally thrilled with either, to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Gosh, despite a new console launching just six months ago, my expectations are relatively low. It'll be busy for third parties, but I think Nintendo will be skipping over its big anniversaries this year (Metroid, Zelda) with little more than a trailer or a remaster.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> think we might see something <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> related in 2026, whether that's a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">3</a>, or heck, even that patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">X</a>! And a teaser for a new game would be lovely, too. <strong>Pokémon Gen X</strong> <em>may</em> be on the cards, but with its usual release window hogged by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA VI</a>... I mean, the kids can play the 'mon while the parents have a new Rockstar game to get through</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong><strong>:</strong> Okay, let's get this one out right from the jump: we're not getting a Zelda in 2026, 40th anniversary be damned! Hmm, perhaps more accurately, I don't think we're getting a <em>new</em> Zelda in 2026. The next big 2D or 3D joint feels a couple of years away, <em>minimum</em>, so it's remake season, baby! I've given up holding out for that fabled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker_hd">Wind Waker</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess HD</a> port, so let's go for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games instead. Just don't touch my beloved Minish Cap.</p>
<p>Otherwise: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> DLC, a new <strong>Pikmin</strong>, and '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> 2'.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm gonna go ahead and suggest we could (or should) be looking at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> action in 2026. And I mean the full smorgasboard of paint-flinging multiplayer mayhem, not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders'</a> solo spin-off. It's been long enough since the superb third entry, and I'd love to see what the new graphical and CPU grunt of S2 could add to the equation.</p>
<p>I also wouldn't be surprised to see something from the vaults, like a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus</a> (one that people universally enjoy controlling) - yeah, that would have me foaming at the mouth, not gonna lie, but there's also plenty of scope for dream level stuff, too. Like a super-charged and graphically glorious return to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, now that Nintendo can go big on the graphics and maybe even deliver slick online options. <em>[Ha! - Ed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I imagine we'll see whatever the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_program">Playtest</a> turns out to be, but I'm hoping for that new 3D Mario to properly get the pulse racing. And for Zelda's 40th, it's the one we've all been waiting for:, the most ludicrous of NS2 Ed. titles, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Tingle's Toetown Hoedown</strong>.</p>
<p>Followed by <strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Fighters Pass Vol 3+4 <strong>+ Subspace Warpdash</strong> for the holidays. Yes, expanding titulature is a pillar of the Switch 2 generation.</strong></p>
<h2>Switch 2 Third-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f21258eeb1218"><a title="2026 Predictions 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f21258eeb1218/2026-predictions-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm sure <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is on everyone's card here, as it should be, and I would also love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> make the jump. Otherwise, I'm gonna go ahead and predict that we'll see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> arrive in a solid port that gets grief for being 30fps in handheld. I'd also suggest third-party racing games and sports games will make a much bigger impact now that a Switch console is capable of running them, so I wouldn't be surprised to see something like <strong>Forza</strong> (the next one <em>is</em> set in Japan).</p>
<p>Heck, maybe we might even have a sniff of something like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_galactic_racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wreckfest_2">Wreckfest 2</a> (or a bundle of some sort), or even the next entry in the <strong>F1</strong> series. Much to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I want ports-galore! Clair Obscur feels like the most open of open goals right now, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some smaller 2025 hits like Blue Prince and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">PEAK</a> make the jump — the latter with Mouse Mode climbing <em>and</em> GameChat? <em>Oof</em>. Let's throw <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> in there, too.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Starting off safe, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will release around six months after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Remake</a>, <em>and</em> we'll also see the third part of the trilogy. Maybe not day one Switch 2, but we'll see. Sticking with Square Enix, 2026 marks Dragon Quest's 40th anniversary. Can we really go <em>another</em> year without seeing <strong>Dragon Quest XII</strong>? I'm not sure, but I think this is the year to reintroduce it to the world.</p>
<p>Going a little leftfield, I really want to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/denshattack">Denshattack!</a> on Switch 2, and when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/"><strong>Fields of Mistria</strong></a> leaves Early Access, I <em>need</em> a port asap. And with the Yakuza train just continuing to roll, can we please have <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Like a Dragon</a>? I think it'll happen.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I love a good port as much as the next sailor, but I'd really like something I <em>haven't</em> already seen at a higher resolution and frame rate elsewhere. But that isn't very useful for a predictions piece, is it?...</p>
<p>Oh, let's say <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/immortality">Immortality</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/rez_infinite">Rez</a>. That's the stuff. And <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/phone/super_hexagon">Super Hexagon</a> at 4K, and with Switch 2's snazzy handheld audio, pulsing, pulsing..., yeah, that's it. C-mon, Tel, don't make me beg. Again.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> represent a clear indication that the Switch 2 is a viable console for so-called 'AAA' third-party games, so as much as I want to see a few ports (yes, Baldur's Gate 3), I'm keen to see completely new games. Neither <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> nor <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/bloodstained_the_scarlet_engagement">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</a> are confirmed for Switch 2 yet, but I'd be very surprised if they skipped Nintendo's console altogether.</p>
<p>Similarly, Capcom seems to be all-in with Nintendo, so it's possible that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/onimusha_way_of_the_sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> also gets a surprise confirmation at some point. Speaking of Capcom, the new <strong>Okami</strong> won't make 2026, but we'll see the first proper trailer and it'll be confirmed for Switch 2.</p>
<h2>Switch Online Additions</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7f3fe5ef02e44"><a title="2026 Predictions 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f3fe5ef02e44/2026-predictions-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> I've been very happy with the GameCube additions to Switch Online so far — a mix of big hitters a weirdo releases. But the biggest one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>, is weirdly absent. It <em>has</em> to happen in 2025, surely? With online functionality, 25 years after its release? What a way to push the Expansion Pack. Otherwise, I'll continue to beg for Pokémon games as long as my life depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I can see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_four_swords_adventures">Zelda: Four Swords Adventure</a> coming to a Switch 2 near you, and Mouse Mode feels like a great fit for DS games.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I've got a fancy new GameCube controller for my fancy almost-new Switch 2, and I'd bloody well like to use it, Nintendo. Specifically, I think we'd all have a great time if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/baten_kaitos_eternal_wings_and_the_lost_ocean">Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</a> showed up for NSO. Failing that, I'll take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/billy_hatcher_and_the_giant_egg">Billy Hatcher.</a></p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> Honestly, I'd be happy to just see <em>more</em> GameCube titles in 2026. Not just first-party games; let's get a few surprises in there. I'm thinking a Silicon Knights double-whammy with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metal_gear_solid_the_twin_snakes">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</a>, but I think it's also notable that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a> has yet to see a release on the Switch or Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> would be delightful, too.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> There's a part of me that's convinced Nintendo is working on a second-screen peripheral for that top USB-C port so we can get DS, 3DS and Wii U libraries on Switch 2. It feels like a long shot for 2026 — especially since the Virtual Boy is right around the corner — so I'll throw out my yearly wish for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Rogue Squadron</a> games on N64 and GameCube, too.</p>
<h2>What about Switch 1?</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d6fe313ad14a3"><a title="2026 Predictions 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6fe313ad14a3/2026-predictions-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> The original Switch will get a couple of new announcements beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a>. I'll keep bringing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">3</a> until it actually happens, and I think Nintendo would put them on Switch 1, too.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I agree with Ollie here, in that Metroid Prime 2 and 3 could work out really well on S1, and what a send-off that would be, especially if they could pad it out with a few new drops. I'll go ahead and suggest a new Pikmin could hit <em>both</em> Switches, alongside any new Mario.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> There's still life in the Switch 1, what with over 150 million units out there, and I think we'll continue to get games on the console over the next year. Largely, it'll be in the form of updates and patches that cater to both consoles, but we'll see.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I think we'll see more uses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-guide-how-to-share-games-locally-and-online">GameShare</a> from Nintendo. They may go back and add that functionality to a couple of games that are missing it, so families that have both consoles can play together. I think that'd be lovely!</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Honestly? The upcoming titles that we already know about might be the last of the <em>new</em> S1 releases. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven</a> feel like a particularly cosy note to end on, and I can't see any mega-busters heading to the old hardware now that Switch 2's in full swing.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The new Rhythm Heaven is legitimately the most exciting thing Nintendo has announced so far for 2026. Is there any point in releasing anything else first-party when you've got GOTY 2026 wrapped and bagged?</p>
<p>I <em>would</em> predict that I'll be picking up a bargain-priced Switch Lite for my collection when stores start selling off inventory cheap. But it seems that prices have skipped the end-of-gen dive and just keep going up. Therefore, the pile of unused hardware in the Billy bookcase won't be getting bigger anytime soon. Probably for the best.</p>

<p><strong>Jim:</strong> The <strong>Mario Galaxy</strong> movie will follow in its predecessor's steps and cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office, Nintendo Pictures has at least one more <strong>Pikmin</strong> short up its sleeve, and we'll get confirmation of a <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> TV series. We'll also see at least three new Nintendo mobile apps with near-identical red and white logos.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> A <strong>Zelda</strong> movie trailer is a given, right? As we've mentioned above, it's the 40th anniversary. That would be a big enough deal for Nintendo, and it's what the company did for Mario's big bash.</p>
<p>One thing I <em>think</em> is weird, given Ninty's big expansion into multimedia, is that we have no big TV show yet. So I think we're going to get one next year. Kirby? Animal Crossing? <em>A Kid Icarus show?</em> I don't know. But have your remotes ready.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> At this point, I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo announces another theme park, or maybe a smattering of new retail stores. The company appears to be really ramping up its visibility to the point of becoming the new Disney, and I'm all for it.</p>
<p>We'll also get <strong>New Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo XL</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I really didn't like the recent Mario movie, but I accept that it's probably not really aimed squarely at me. So, yeah, I guess that's gonna be the big obvious thing next year for Nintendo, another Jack Black video game movie (groan).</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Animal Crossing expansion for one of the theme parks, and an increase in quality merch like the stuff currently hitting My Nintendo Stores. I do like the look of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-reveals-new-line-of-metroid-merch-and-we-want-it-all">those Metroid ice trays</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/hardware_classics_pokemon_mini">Pokémon Mini</a> comes to NSO.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> As images and scientific data related to the interstellar object 3i/Atlas are studied in early 2026, it's discovered that the anomaly, only the third of its kind ever to pass through our galactic neighbourhood, is actually Starship Mario. It's all real.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> So, let's go back to my slight Metroid 40th anniversary dismissal and propose a remake — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>. I don't know if I want it, but by goodness, what a way to get people scrambling for joy. And shock. And maybe disappointment?</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> <strong>Star Fox</strong>. Yeah, I said it. The dream is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_fox_64">64</a> remake, natch, but if Nintendo wants to grace us with an all-new entry on a system where people will actually play it, you'll hear no complaints from me. 2026 is the year, I'm telling you!</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> It'll be <strong>Zelda</strong>'s 40th Anniversary in 2026, so Nintendo might surprise us with something special. How about a remake of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">original NES game</a>? Nothing groundbreaking, but maybe something akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_zero_mission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a> on the GBA. Keep it top-down with pixel art visuals, streamline it appropriately, and I'd buy it in an instant.</p>

<p>We've had our eyes on this long-lost GBA-looking adventure ever since we first discovered it at Gamescom <a href="https://x.com/ZionDood/status/1826268852617126059">back in 2024</a>. The combat, movement, and visuals instantly reminded us of the handheld Zelda entries, but instead of a sword, the main protagonist uses a yoyo to dispatch foes and solve loads of puzzles. You've also got a spunky, blue bat protagonist that looks like they jumped straight out of the SNES era. What's not to love here?!</p>
<p>Pocket Trap's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> comes to Switch this week, and to celebrate we linked up with the Game Director and Lead Programmer <strong>Henrique Lorenzi</strong> to ask some questions about his love for yoyos, Nintendo's games, and Yoko Shimomura.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:179410 @ 1767020033 -->

<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: We played through the free demo you have on the Switch eShop, and we loved how</strong> <strong>versatile an item the yoyo is for Pippit! Do you remember when you had that lightbulb</strong> <strong>moment, when you knew you wanted to build a game around a yoyo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Henrique Lorenzi:</strong> As game designers, we’ve found that one of the best ways to create enjoyable experiences is to take objects that the player is familiar with in the real world and transform them into gameplay mechanics. We’ve made it a habit to set up a board at the beginning of every project, where the entire team can participate by throwing in ideas. So we had a board full of images of ordinary objects like a hammer, a slingshot, a baseball bat, a hand saw, roller skates – you name it! The yoyo was special, though.</p>
<p>Not only could it be considered a 'cool kid’s' item, but the gameplay ideas involving it started pouring in non-stop! At that point, the lightbulb lit up, as you said – we realised this item would allow for a pretty extensive and deep game! We started sketching game screens, thinking about how the various challenges would play out – it was at this point that we also incorporated diagonals to the level design, which are places where the yoyo can bounce off of and help extend your range. Everything felt solid, and we were confident we had some great game-design possibilities in our hands!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e8fb113110385"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8fb113110385/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Early development sketches — <em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Did the yoyo start life as anything else originally, or did you always know you wanted the main weapon to be one?</strong></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to make some kind of a 'Zelda-like' game, but try to stray away from medieval fantasy themes. So we were looking for an item that could replace the sword in combat. After we stumbled upon the humble yoyo, we noticed a pretty strong point in its favour: differently to the usual approach of having the player juggle a wide range of items that each enable a certain action – like having weapons for combat, a boomerang for puzzle-solving, and special boots for wall-jumping and platforming –, the yoyo would be able to cover all of these use-cases on its own!</p>
<p>The player’s progression would be tied to the knowledge of particular yoyo tricks, so it perfectly translated the experience someone might have with the real thing. And regarding the game’s setting and themes, the yoyo provided a great opportunity to take everything into the contemporary era! So you’re a radical kid using your favourite toy in a modern-world city with modern-world problems. We had hit the perfect combo for the relatable experience we wanted to create!</p>
<p><strong>From the demo alone, we can see a lot of Nintendo’s DNA in Pipistrello. This really does look and feel like something that would have been released on the GBA! What games in particular do you feel the team drew inspiration from?</strong></p>
<p>I’m so glad you’ve noticed this! We’re longtime Nintendo fans, and everyone on the team has grown up playing Nintendo games. The Game Boy Advance really felt like peak handheld gaming back in the day, so we were excited at the possibility of bringing a nostalgic feeling to players familiar with it. We’ve even added an optional 3D Console mode to the game that simulates the experience of playing on a real GBA, including responsive buttons, an adjustable and rotatable camera, and – get this – even glare from the screen if you hold it at just the right position!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e5f334052a4bc"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5f334052a4bc/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But of course, we didn’t want to just mimic the thing, but also modernise the gaming experience and make it appealing to new players as well: the physics engine has lots of quality-of-life improvements – such as coyote-time, corner-sliding, landing assist, and magnetic edges – and if you get a Game Over you can restart from the same screen without any downtime. One of our aspirations was perhaps to create a new source of joy that could be passed down through generations, just like Nintendo has.</p>
<p>Speaking of games that have inspired us, I’d say the most direct have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">The Minish Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a>, but we also took a page from older and newer games alike – from the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> on the NES, to the latest entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the world map and exploration? Will there be interconnected areas like in a Metroidvania, or will there be sections that have a start and a finish, much like a Zelda dungeon?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a bit of everything in Pipistrello! The navigation around the city is completely interconnected, with branching and merging paths. The city map is fully filled in and massive, so you can bet there will be something interesting no matter what direction you go in, and on top of everything, it’s teeming with secrets! Did I mention we also have a second layer to the entire city? Players can drop below to the sewers level and explore even more sprawling environments – something akin to the Dark World or the Depths!</p>
<p>Beyond that, once you reach a dungeon or mini-dungeon, the experience becomes more like a classic Zelda – strongly thematic and narrative-driven experiences which emphasise one or more specific game mechanics. Remember we kept our themes contemporary, so our dungeons take place in a police department, a shopping mall, a skyscraper mid-construction, a pop-culture convention, a sports stadium, and more! I think players will have a blast unravelling each location’s lore and secrets.</p>

<p><strong>We had a blast with the demo, but we found the Don Mauretti boss fight particularly challenging! We liked how theoretically you could defeat him with simple yoyo strikes, but you could deal more damage by bouncing the yoyo off walls. Will the game have any sort of difficulty options, and on a scale of 1 to 10, how tough do you think he is in comparison to other bosses in the game?</strong></p>
<p>It does feel way more challenging in the demo! That fight has been tailored for players with many hours of experience in the game, and we didn’t want to nerf the boss for the demo and risk losing the interesting bits. We offer three scenarios in the demo so that players can have a taste of different parts of the game, but these scenarios aren’t consecutive in the full game at all. At the point you go against Don Mauretti in the full game, the player will have access to many Badges and Upgrades, not to mention Charged and Special Moves such as the Parry and the Flurry Attack – all things that the full game introduces at an appropriate pace, providing detailed explanations and training areas to practice – so we’re confident the player will have the ability and the tools necessary to overcome these fights! The game’s progression is not linear, so a player can even explore other city districts and fight other bosses before going into Don Mauretti’s turf.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the game also offers several difficulty settings, which allow the player to fine-tune the gameplay experience to suit their tastes, both to the easier side as well as the harder side. We’d say Don Mauretti is about a 7 or 8 on the difficulty scale, and the four main bosses have all been designed to display a similar level of challenge. These four main bosses serve as the final trial on the player’s mastery journey throughout each city district and dungeon, so each one offers something different in terms of required skills and fight dynamics. But don’t forget there are still other bosses and mini-bosses (and secret bosses!) for the player to track down and fight!</p>
<p><strong>We also noticed some issues with the frame rate dropping pretty substantially in the final section of the Don boss fight (we were playing in handheld mode.) Do you hope to have those issues worked out for the full launch on Switch?</strong></p>
<p>After the demo launched, we’ve gone through extensive optimisation passes on the Nintendo Switch. We’re so sorry about your previous experience! Now I can say that all areas of the game run perfectly smoothly, including the boss fight you mentioned, no matter if you’re playing it docked or handheld! The Nintendo Switch is a priority of ours, and we’ve put a lot of work into it, with things like HD Rumble support tailored for each action Pippit can take. We believe it’s one of the best platforms to enjoy the game on! The updated demo should be available shortly on the Nintendo eShop, so you don’t have to just take my word for it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c1e9959f1db1d"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1e9959f1db1d/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>We took a look through the developer credits and we noticed you have Yoko Shimomura on the team composing the soundtrack! Whoa! Can you talk about the process of pitching the game to her and what it’s been like working with her?</strong></p>
<p>Having grown up with Nintendo games, we’ve naturally grown up attached to Yoko Shimomura’s work as well! With our idea to develop a GBA-inspired game, who else would be most suited to bring on board if not her? We felt that, taking into account her work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> and the <strong>Mario &amp; Luigi</strong> series, and especially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga">Superstar Saga</a> on the GBA, she could bring unmatched authenticity to Pipistrello’s retro design aesthetic, and it could result in the game being elevated even more towards that Nintendo standard we were seeking. Naturally, it was kind of nerve-wracking contacting a world-class composer like her for the first time! We didn’t know if she’d even agree to working with us.</p>
<p>We knew she could have a very tight schedule, so we made sure to pitch this to her very early on – we sent out the first email one whole year before production actually started! (Maybe that was an excessively long time? But it pays to think in advance!) Much to our surprise, she was very open to the idea! We sent her full documents describing the game and the setting, along with screenshots and videos of the areas she’d be composing for, as well as some musical references (some of them her own songs!)</p>
<p>I imagine it must have been quite a surprise to her that we weren’t looking for a full orchestral sound, but we actually asked for the production to take a step back and embrace the GBA era! So she employed some of those vintage Roland Sound Canvas synthesisers used back in the day, for a real throwback. We were extremely happy with the experience, and will most definitely be looking to repeat this partnership in the future! I hope players will keep an ear out while playing the game!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, we have to know...does anyone on the development team know any rad, real-world yoyo tricks? Bonus points if they can prove it!</strong></p>
<p>As kids, we had a lot of contact with toy yoyos, and companies were even packaging them with snacks and soda. But that’s hardly anything that allows us to be considered enthusiasts, let alone professionals at the yoyo.</p>

<p>That said, we did actually go deep into research while developing Pipistrello, watching yoyo competition videos, learning the theory behind a multitude of tricks, and speaking with people who know this topic way better than us!</p>
<p>Some people on the team obtained professional yoyos during development to aid in the creative process (and played around with them for a bit), and one of us actually has more experience with the diabolo, a related apparatus. All in all, though, I think becoming a yoyo champion is a fantasy best left to Pippit at this point, haha!</p>

<p>Could an upgrade be on the way?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="669da210f13f6"><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/669da210f13f6/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Switch 2 generation got underway, many Nintendo fans have been hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> titles to receive a next-generation upgrade. Now, in an interesting development, a Switch 2 rating has surfaced on the European age rating board PEGI for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>This rating was apparently filed by 'Nintendo of Europe SE' on 28th December 2025 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pikmin-3-deluxe-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe">thanks, Gematsu</a>). It's 'PEGI 3' (the same classification as the Switch game listed), contains "occasional, very mild violence in a comical or abstract context" and is suitable for all ages.</p>
<p>The same brief outline of the game is also attached to this rating, but no other significant details have been shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Pikmin 3 Deluxe, players take command of three explorers and a legion of adorable Pikmin in a fight for survival. By employing the unique abilities of these tiny Pikmin creatures, players will solve puzzles, battle dangerous predators and recover food needed to save the explorers' depleted home planet."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> made its debut in 2020 and follows the original Wii U entry from 2013. The Switch version of the game received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pikmin-3-deluxes-new-update-fixes-screen-flicker-issue-when-playing-on-switch-2">small update in June of this year</a>, improving the gameplay experience on Switch 2, but there has been no upgrade for the title so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> also received a free content update in November, adding new content and new modes.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously released free and paid Switch 2 upgrades for existing Switch titles. This included <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free Switch game updates</a> when the new hybrid system launched in June.</p>
