<p>Are you the type of person who never misnames Samus 'Metroid'? Do you always know where to put the accent in Pokémon? Do you have the skills to prove your Nintendo passions on camera? Then, gosh, do we have the opportunity for you!</p>
<p>We at Nintendo Life are on the lookout for someone to join our Video Production team. As outlined in the above video by <del>Alex Olney</del> <em>Brad the Business</em>, you'd be chatting about the latest and greatest games from Nintendo, diving into reviews and guides, and snapping up gameplay all through the wonderful world of YouTube.</p>
<p>Just in case Al-sorry, <em>Brad's</em> instructions weren't clear enough, you'll find all the details about the role and how you can apply on <a href="https://apply.workable.com/hookshot/j/9B75C3E03D/">Workable</a>. Those wishing to shoot their shot will need to submit a three to five-minute face-to-camera video application in which you tell us a bit about yourself, share your favourite Nintendo franchises (and an obscure pick), and let us know anything else about you and your work — including some recent examples!</p>
<p>If all of this sounds very much up your street, head over to the <a href="https://apply.workable.com/hookshot/j/9B75C3E03D/">job listing</a> for the full list of requirements and desired skills. Then, if you think you'd fit the bill, make sure to get your application in by <strong>24th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Good luck to all those applying!</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>
