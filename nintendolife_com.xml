<figure data-uuid="344fee7dbef72"><a title="Croc: Legend of the Gobbos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/344fee7dbef72/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Argonaut Software</em></figcaption></figure><p>Poor old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a>. The Argonaut Games remaster arrived on Switch on <strong>2nd April</strong>, the very same day that we were all distracted by the monster Switch 2 reveal Direct, and those who pre-ordered the physical edition way back in Oct 2024 <em>still</em> have no idea when it's going to arrive. Talk about a Croc-y start.</p>
<p>The game itself was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/croc-remaster-will-miss-its-december-2024-launch-window">delayed</a> back in late 2024. After launch, Rock It Games, the company behind the physical, said that <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/croc-update">tariff issues</a> had "made it temporarily difficult to schedule shipments for some items," but things were supposedly back on track. Then, following the release of the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/crocs-switch-remaster-returns-this-week-with-a-free-platinum-edition-update">'Platinum Edition' update</a> last October, the company pushed things again to get the whole game complete on cartridge — "the unavoidable consequence of this upgrade meant delays in the mastering, approval process and physical manufacture of the disc and cartridge with Sony and Nintendo respectively."</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gimkwh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, where does that leave things now? In a <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/coc-legend-of-the-gobbos-january-2026-update">new blog post</a>, Rock It says that "the delays have been unacceptable," and that going forward, it will be committed to "only offering games once development is complete and our delivery timelines are fully under our control." But there's still no firm release date.</p>
<p>According to the post, the game disc and cartridges have now been approved for production by Sony and Nintendo, Platinum Edition update included, and much of the extra merch found in the beefy Collector's Editions is either complete or arriving in the warehouse by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The thing is, the production updates aren't consistent between posts — one month, items are complete and ready to go, the next, they're not. Mix-ups happen, of course, but those who dropped $129.99 on the Collector's Edition over a year ago are, rightly, after something a little more concrete.</p>

<p>"I have zero trust in Rock It Games because of this," one user wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/">r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/comments/1qfs5w9/argonaut_acknowledges_delays/">Reddit</a>, "If they would have just told the truth, and admitted things got screwed up, and didn't go to plan, I would have been disappointed, but understood." Others have been so frustrated with the process that they have already requested refunds.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that the regular and Collector’s Editions of Croc are coming soon," developer Argonaut Games said in an update post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTmH2B5FmHd/">Instagram</a>, "We’re as eager to receive them as all of our customers are!"</p>
<p>When exactly "soon" is remains to be seen, but hey, maybe 2026 will be the year!</p>

<p>Described as an 'interactive Pokémon experience' that will "stimulate all five senses", the attraction will debut at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka before being rolled out globally. This presumably includes parks in Orlando and Los Angeles in the US along with Singapore and Beijing.</p>
<p>Tsunekazu Ishihara, President and CEO of The Pokémon Company, had the following to say:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22flyihwp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Since announcing our medium- to long-term alliance in 2021, we have collaborated with Universal Studios Japan's outstanding creative vision and world-class technical capabilities to produce a variety of 'real-life Pokémon experiences,' including the NO LIMIT! Parade and Halloween show.</p>
<p>"This year marks the 30th anniversary of Pokémon, and we are extremely pleased to be able to fully launch this new project with you all at this major milestone. Our mission is to enrich both the real and virtual worlds through the existence of Pokémon, and we produce Pokémon every day. With this project, too, we hope to create new entertainment that is unique to theme parks, as a rich experience in the real world, and continue to provide surprises to people all over the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no time scale as to when the attraction will launch, but those in Japan can at least look forward to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokepark-kanto-the-new-pokemon-theme-park-opens-its-doors-in-february">opening of Poké Park Kanto</a> at Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we'll keep an eye out any further developments regarding the new Pokémon attraction at Universal Studios. If nothing else, we're expecting to see lots and lots (and <em>lots</em>) of new merch.</p>

<p>Rosalina, Bowser Jr. and..?</p>

<figure data-uuid="e27b95019ca98"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e27b95019ca98/super-mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Illumination</em></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the Sonic movies, the Mario movies are expanding their big-screen universe by introducing and surprising audiences with more characters. Mario's companion Yoshi was teased at the end of the first movie, and since then, the official trailers for the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong> have introduced Bowser Jr. and Rosalina.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-s-appearances-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-chris-pratt-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-people-should-be-excited/">GamesRadar+ recently</a>, Mario's movie voice actor Chris Pratt has apparently hinted there are at least "a couple more" characters not featured in the official trailers for the new movie that should excite fans. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, yes, there are," Pratt tells GamesRadar+ when we ask if there are any new characters he's looking forward to seeing in the finished film. "I'm not allowed to say what they are, but yes, there are some really incredible… Well, I think some of them have been released in the trailer – Rosalina, Bowser Jr. – and then there's even a couple more that are not in the trailer that people should be excited to see."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Pratt is teasing a bigger cast of characters, there are plenty of friendly and not-so-friendly characters from the Mario video game universe that could pop up. One rumoured leak, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52847-rumor-more-characters-revealed-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">dating back to last September</a>, has led to speculation that Wario could be making an appearance.</p>
<p>You can see the current cast for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie in our guide. Nintendo and Illumination have also confirmed Rosalina will be voiced by Brie Larson and Bowser Jr. will be played by Benny Safdie.</p>

<p>Including multiple fixes for Mega Dimension</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c7c6076c5421f"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7c6076c5421f/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has received its first update of the year today for the Switch and Switch 2. When you download it, your copy will be updated to Version 2.0.1.</p>
<p>It focuses on some adjustments for obtaining certain items (including an increase to the maximum number of Mega Shards) and also applies a whole bunch of fixes to previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> expansion issues. You can read more about this in a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71193/kw/pokemon%20legends%20z-a%202.0.1">separate post</a> on Nintendo's support site.</p>
<p>Here's the rundown of this latest update:</p>
<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released January 21, 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Adjustments Applied for Obtaining Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When purchasing Berries from a food stall, you can now purchase multiple Berries at once.</em></li>
<li><em>After beginning the story of the Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension DLC, you will be able purchase Berries from the clerk at Nouveau Café’s Truck No. 3.</em></li>
<li><em>The maximum number of Mega Shards you can carry has been increased from 999 to 9,999.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Applied for the Following Confirmed Issues Related to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</em> Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When using moves in certain pockets of hyperspace, Pokémon may sometimes have faced a different direction from the intended target.</em></li>
<li><em>There were cases in which the weather remained sunny and did not change.</em></li>
<li><em>Shiny Pokémon obtained prior to the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension may not have been registered to the Mega Evolution Pokédex, even if their Mega Stones were obtained after becoming available in the DLC.</em></li>
<li><em>During missions, images from unrelated scenes may occasionally have been displayed.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may not have been able to complete side mission 188 “Start Special Scanning!” even after earning the maximum number of survey points. (Players who are already experiencing this issue should be able to progress after entering and exiting hyperspace.)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In case you missed it, the Mega Dimension expansion DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A released at the end of last year. Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to our expectations here at Nintendo Life, with repetitive Hyperspace dimensions and bland level design, but it's hard to resist the lure of an expanded Pokédex.</p>
<p>You can find out what else we had to say about it in our full review:</p>

<p>Nintendo has also released new updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> today, and yesterday rolled out a surprise update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>.</p>
