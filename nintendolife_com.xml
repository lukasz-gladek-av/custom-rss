<figure data-uuid="a625d947728ab"><a title="Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a625d947728ab/requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Resident Evil fans have been pondering whether the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will reintroduce series veteran Leon Kennedy, and while Capcom has remained tight-lipped on the subject, it has nevertheless confirmed that more legacy characters will indeed show up.</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/">WellPlayed</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa stated that "there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game". Of course, it's still very much up in the air who exactly he's referring to here, but we can at least narrow it down a teeny, tiny bit.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hrtjqo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it. We can’t promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most likely candidates seem to be Leon and Claire Redfield from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a>, but since <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft is making an appearance, might we also see the likes of Kevin Ryman, David King, Yoko Suzuki, and more from the 2003 online entry?</p>
<p>Admittedly, we're doing exactly what Kumazawa-san said not to do – we're hyping ourselves up a bit too much. It's exciting stuff though!</p>
<p>The producer also gave some reasoning as to why Requiem will be taking players back to the ruins of Raccoon City. After portraying more rural environments in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, he believes that going back to where it all began is "best for the fans".</p>
<p>Capcom will be broadcasting a new Resident Evil Showcase in early 2026, and while it seems likely that we'll receive more answers there as to which characters might show up, we kinda hope the team keeps everything secret until the game's launch in February.</p>

<p>Or eighteen years, for many of us</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has debuted two new ads for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> ahead of its release on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>All things considered, there's not a great deal here that we haven't seen before, with one ad (above) focusing primarily on the Federation Troopers you'll be meeting on your journey (including the beloved Myles Mackenzie) while the other (below) showcases the mouse controls for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, the ads come as the eight-year wait since Prime 4's initial announcement nears its end. Hard to believe we're here, folks. As a reminder, the game was showcased at E3 (remember <em>that</em><em>?</em>) during the Switch's first year on the market, with Bandai Namco Studios rumoured to be at the helm. Development was then scrapped and restarted in 2019 under original developer Retro Studios after Nintendo concluded that the game's quality was not up to scratch.</p>
<p>For many of us, though, we've actually been waiting a whole eighteen years for Metroid Prime 4. 2007 saw the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, and the only new entry to see the light of day since then was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Metroid Prime: Federation Force</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>So there's a lot riding on this then. No pressure, Retro.</p>

<p>Last week, we heard how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> had become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-now-the-best-selling-physical-game-in-the-us-this-year">"best-selling" physical game in the US</a> of the year.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, Circana's video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has shared official chart data for this same location, confirming the new entry in the long-running series was the best-selling game on Nintendo platforms in October 2025. This does not factor in the digital sales of the title.</p>
<p>It replaced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> in the top spot, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remains in third place.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59kphujl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mat Piscatella:</strong> "Pokémon Legends: Z-A ranked 2nd overall during October and was the month’s best-selling game on Nintendo platforms. It launched as 2025’s best-selling physical game year-to-date."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted by Piscatella, Pokémon Legends: Z-A placed second behind EA's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> (which also made its debut last month) in the "best-selling games" for the US in October 2025.</p>
<p>Once again, this doesn't include the digital sales for Pokémon. Further down this list was Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 in 13th place (one rank higher than the previous month).</p>

<p>Piscatella has also shared some details about Nintendo Switch 2 sales growth in this location during October 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Video game hardware spending in October grew 36% when compared a year ago, to $351M. Switch 2 was again able to offset declines across Switch (-52% versus a year ago... Nintendo Switch 2 sold 328k units in October. It is 68% ahead of the sales pace set by the original Nintendo Switch and is 3% ahead of PlayStation 4’s previous record velocity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A this week revealed more information about its upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC.
