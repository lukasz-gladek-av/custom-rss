<p>The rollercoaster ride of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> releases is continuing at breakneck pace, as TPC has revealed that the next Themed Booster Expansion will arrive next week on <strong>28th August</strong>.</p>
<p>The 'Secluded Springs' expansion is another Gen II-focused set, with legendaries Raikou, Entei, and Suicune taking centre stage. A bunch of other Johto and Hoenn 'mon will be tagging along for the ride, and the new teaser trailer showcases some sweet full-arts for the likes of Milotic and our beloved Phanpy.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at a handful of the cards shown in the trailer:</p>


<p>It feels like just yesterday that we first set eyes on the Ho-Oh and Lugia Wisdom of Sea and Sky set, and our Pack Hourglasses are still flagging because of it. As a reminder, the last set came bundled with a sizeable slice of drama after TPC was hit with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pocket-updates-card-art-following-plagiarism-allegations">plagiarism accusations</a> following the release of the two central legendary full-art cards. TPC quickly released a statement in which it "deeply apologize[d]" for the error, pulled the card art in question, and replaced it a week later.</p>
<p>In other TCG Pocket news, TPC closed out this year's World Championships with a tease that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-expansion-introduces-a-mega-mix-up">Mega Evolutions</a> will be coming to the app at some point "this fall".</p>
