<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> is one of the six games up for the grand prize, and before the ceremony can get underway, developer Supergiant Games has shared a heartwarming piece of artwork, congratulating its fellow nominees.</p>
<p>The art depicts the main character from each of the six games (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/kingdom_come_deliverance_ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and, of course, Hades II) dressed in their finest award ceremony attire and gracing the red carpet. We're particularly enamoured by the tiny little Hornet sitting on DK's shoulder — just look at those guys!</p><div><figure data-videoid="JmOlmniuSog" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJmOlmniuSog" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed624b7crjhyxv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>"We’re deeply honored that HADES II is in the running for Game of the Year and more at #TheGameAwards tonight," the Supergiant message accompanying the art reads, "especially since we’re in the company of such an amazing group of wildly different and beautiful games. Congratulations to all our fellow nominees — we salute you!!"</p>

<p>Clair Obscur is the big favourite to take home the grand prize tonight (and every other award, it seems), but we'd be happy to see just about any finalist walk away with the win. Bananza is also nominated in the Best Family Game category alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<p>Mega!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The next expansion heading for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> has been revealed, and it has some very familiar faces front and centre.</p>
<p>The Crimson Blaze set launches on <strong>17th December</strong>, and sees Mega Charizard Y plastered across the packet cover. Naturally, new cards for Mega Venusaur and Mega Blastoise are included too, alongside new art for the Kanto starters and fresh card covers/backdrops.</p>
<p>The above trailer gives us a pretty good idea of what the set will have in store, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>The last set to arrive in the app was October's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-new-expansion-as-app-surpasses-150-million-downloads">Mega Rising expansion</a>, which ushered a new range of risky Mega Evolutions into the card battler. It'll be interesting to see how long these Mega cards stay in play as new sets keep rolling out in 2026.</p>
