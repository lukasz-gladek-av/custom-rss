<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160492/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Video games are good. The internet is <em>good</em>. Sometimes, it’s hard to remember that nowadays, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> — the second visual novel from Kinmoku — is determined to remind us of the impact of online communities and the relationships we forge through playing video games. It’s also the most accurate depiction of online life in the mid-2000s I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>The year is 2003 and Emmett is a 15-year-old German kid who loves his Kinmoku Shark, a fictional games console that is essentially a desktop Nintendo DS. He’s playing Feudal Fantasy, a game recommended to him by one of his online friends. He also spends a lot of time on Videoverse, an online social platform akin to something like MySpace or ye olde message boards; think Steam, but cooler with pixel art avatars and two-tone colour schemes.</p>
<p>The majority of the game takes place in Videoverse, where Emmett chats with his friends about games and users post messages and <strong>Miiverse</strong>-like doodles. Here, you can respond to messages, ‘like’ drawings, and DM your friends.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160488/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game beautifully allows you to foster a positive environment by choosing how you respond. These responses can lead to small quests that you can follow in the background. But even when there was a chance to be a little meaner, it always felt <em>wrong</em>. I couldn’t bring myself to put down a stick-man drawing at any point. Why should I? I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of nasty comments online.</p>
<p>But Videoverse doesn’t shy away from the sour side of the internet; after all, the Shark is an ageing console, and with an upgraded model (the Dolphin) on the horizon, the devs slowly start to pull away from Videoverse. As a result, moderation starts to slip, and hateful messages, ranging from homophobic insults to ableist comments and lewd drawings, trickle through. A space once considered safe to so many, where they could proudly proclaim their sexuality or escape from real-life troubles, suddenly becomes toxic and hostile. Tempers bubble over, anxieties flood the art pages, and relationships fray.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/4913/embed @ 1763125204 -->
<p>It’s scarily accurate, and you can see just how that side of the online world has exploded over the past two decades. But Videoverse remains emphatically positive in the face of hate: I reported every nasty message I saw, and I always tagged other players and lifted them up when they felt down. Kindness is always the right thing to do here, and the writing is beautifully accurate to the 2003 time period. I was (and still am) a liberal smiley face user back in the mid-2000s — though there was a bit more XD and ^_^; than (: — but it’s all here in Videoverse, complete with typos and abbreviations.</p>
<p>Along with the writing, the general aesthetic goes such a long way to selling the nostalgia of the era. The interface is all 1-bit with bold colours (and changeable themes you unlock by commenting and reporting), customisable avatars, and lo-fi music that clearly evokes old gaming lobbies and chill spaces. Special shoutout goes to the incredible Feudal Fantasy animated cutscenes that help frame the entire narrative, too.</p>
<p>Sadly, navigating Videoverse on Switch can be a little cumbersome. You can use buttons or touchscreen, but both have drawbacks. Moving a cursor around the screen with the analogue stick is sluggish and fiddly; sometimes it disappeared mid-conversation, while other times it was distracting. The touchscreen is better, but it's so easy to select the wrong option or accidentally skip dialogue as you click through options.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160491/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But Emmett’s central relationship with a brand new user, Vivi, who attracts his attention thanks to her fantastic art, is the central story here, and it's strong enough to pull you through any input irritations. The two form a friendship which starts off awkward and shy but blossoms into something affirming. I had a friendship just like Emmett does with Vivi, though it was with someone I knew in real life. We spoke almost exclusively through MSN Messenger (remember that?) despite living in the same town and going to different schools, but we’d write stories together, talk about life, what we were reading, listening to, playing…I miss it</p>
<p>It's for this reason that Vivi’s character and her relationship with Emmett hit me the hardest. Not knowing whether you’ve upset someone, said the wrong thing, or not knowing what's going on in someone's life that you care about is heartbreaking, and the game captures that perfectly. The writing is already excellent throughout, but it’s between these two where it truly delivers, shining yet another light on what community and video games can really do for people.</p>
<p>Do I wish some of Emmett's other relationships had that same depth? A little! MarKun666, for instance, is the Feudal Fantasy fan; Emmett and him have met in real life and are close, always encouraging each other and having fun. But it rarely goes beyond that. Zalor, meanwhile, is having trouble with his online girlfriend Tifa-Chan, and by the end it feels like that whole situation gets swept under the rug.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160495/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But that’s a part of life, right? People move on, and sometimes you never find out what happened to those you spent hours chatting with or reading posts from. I’ve lost contact with many friends I’ve made online, and it’s a scary reminder of the ephemerality of the digital world. But those connections <em>can</em> last outside of that space, and — most importantly — their impact certainly does.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be where I am today without those hours-long chats on Messenger. I wouldn’t have a job writing about video games if I hadn't played <strong>RuneScape</strong> online or discussed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tales_of_symphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a> with like-minded strangers on message boards. The internet may feel like a black hole of hate and AI-generated content in 2025, and the games industry is rife with layoffs and accusations of workplace abuse, but I cling to the hope and the human relationships I’ve formed in both of these spaces. Behind every avatar is a human, and Videoverse clings to that very same notion.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Videoverse is a perfect time capsule of early online communities, never shying away from difficult topics and always approaching them with a smile. Its nostalgic wrapping works wonders for Millennials who grew up with a mouse or console in hand and who have made friends online.</p>
<p>While I wish there were a few more chats with other characters, and the Switch may not be the <em>best</em> place to experience it due to input frustrations, Videoverse is a tonic for the soul that the online world needs now more than ever.</p></section>

<p>Here are the full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Shortly after launch back in September, Marvelous revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-roadmap-outlined">2025 roadmap</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, and today, we've arrived at another stop on the journey.</p>
<p>The mech action/adventure has today landed its 'Into the Abyss' paid DLC, a story expansion that sees you sent out to explore an all-new map area, Survey Zone: Locus Initi. You can expect to find new enemies, new gear, and a whole new Axiom base to get your head around.</p>
<p>The 'Into the Abyss' DLC is now available to all those with the Digital Deluxe or Super Deluxe versions of the game. Alternatively, you can purchase the expansion separately on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/DLC/Daemon-X-Machina-Titanic-Scion-Into-the-Abyss-2860504.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£13.49 / $14.99</strong>. Do note that you'll need to have made it past Chapter 18 'Investigate the Facility's Depths' in the base game to see any of this bonus content.</p>

<p>But it's not just paid news for Titanic Scion today, since the game has also landed a free update to bump things up to ver. 1.2. There are a bunch of pesky bugs targeted by this one, as outlined in the full patch below (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342490/Daemon_X_Machina_Titanic_Scion/">Steam</a>).</p>

・Weapons that were only available through shops can now be obtained in the field after a certain point.<br>
・Fixed an issue where the number of foes grabbed was not counted when armed with certain weapons.<br>

・Fixed multiple other bugs.</p>
<hr>
<p>We had a perfectly fine time with Titanic Scion when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, but felt that it was let down by its performance issues, which made for a "janky experience in places, with mushy controls and limp feedback". Let's hope that this patch can help move things in the right direction.</p>

<p>Yes, the 2.1.0 patch is here, and it adds... well, a couple of things. First up, we've got a new, smaller calendar app that no longer takes up the whole ruddy home screen, so that's nice if you like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Second is a new filter that lets you streamline the news feed according to specific characters. You better believe we'll be laser-focused on anything to do with Samus for the next few weeks!</p>
<p>So let's check out the official patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Added Calendar Widget Sizes</strong></p>
<p>- Added a small widget you can use to check the weekly calendar.</p>
<p><strong>News and Browsing History Filtering</strong></p>
<p>- News and browsing history can now be filtered by character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, that's yer lot.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also recently released a separate app for its storefront, featuring games, accessories, and more. With the Nintendo Music and the Nintendo Switch apps, this is now totals four. Maybe it's time to combine these together in some way, Nintendo..?</p>

<p>We had a great time with Grand Bazaar when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, and we were particular fans of how gosh darn charming the whole thing is: "Marvelous has really taken a lot of time to perfect the gameplay loop of Grand Bazaar, and that polish has also spilled out into the characters and the visuals."
