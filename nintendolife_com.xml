<p>Admission continues via randomly selected drawings</p>

<figure data-uuid="bfb18335d938c"><a title="Nintendo Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bfb18335d938c/nintendo-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Alex Olney / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Museum has been open to the public for roughly a year at this point and, thanks to the ongoing lottery system for prospective visitors, the venue has already played host to quite a few people.</p>
<p>Announced via Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a>, the company states that the "cumulative number of<br>
visitors surpassed half a million as of the end of September", and that it will continue to implement randomly selected drawings going forward. This is simply due to the large number of numbers, and Nintendo has apologised for any inconvenience this might cause.</p>
<p>It notes that it opened a new art gallery on 3rd September 2025 showcasing development materials and original character art, while reiterating its plan to host limited-time light displays from December 2025.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, visitors will also be treated to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-museum-introduces-limited-time-mario-bros-40th-anniversary-ticket">limited Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary ticket design</a>. Available for "approximately one year", its introduction coincides with "a special installation featuring the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary logo" that visitors can take photos with during their stay.</p>
<p>Nintendo has offered up a whole bunch of announcements for Mario's 40th birthday, including the debut trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, plus the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> for the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d3744b6137770"><a title="Nintendo Store 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3744b6137770/nintendo-store-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has launched a storefront app – simply titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_store">Nintendo Store</a> – for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znej">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">iOS</a>, letting you browse everything including eShop titles, accessories, amiibo, apparel, and more.</p>
<p>Originally available exclusively in Japan as the 'My Nintendo' app, this has now been updated and reworked for worldwide use. It's not quite a dedicated experience, mind you, since clicking on any given product will take you through to the relevant page in your default browser.</p>
<p>That said, it's a good way to quickly see what's new and on offer, particularly if you enable notifications for new sales. You can also review your play activity for the Switch, Switch 2, 3DS, and Wii U. For the latter two systems, you'll need to ensure you link your Nintendo Network ID with your Nintendo Account, with play activity available prior to February 2020.</p>
<p>Interestingly, play activity for every game is broken down further than ever. Previously, either via console or the Nintendo Switch App, you could see how many total hours you'd sunk into any given game.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Store app, however, it literally breaks this down into play activity each day. So you can see exactly how much time you've sunk into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, for example, every day since its launch back in October (though if you boot something up very briefly, it'll log the play activity as "a little while" rather than an exact time).</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features directly from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Shop on My Nintendo Store</strong> – You can use this app to browse Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch systems and accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo products and merchandise—and then jump directly to My Nintendo Store to make purchases. (Note: Physical products are not available in all countries / regions.)</p>
<p><strong>- Get the Latest Info on Games</strong> – You can stay up-to-date with the latest news on Nintendo games, events, and more!</p>
<p>- <strong>Receive Notifications About Sales</strong> – You can turn on push notifications for when items on your Wish List go on sale.</p>
<p>- <strong>Review Your Play Activity</strong> – You can sign in with your Nintendo Account to see your Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch play activity. If you had a Nintendo 3DS or Wii U system, you can see your play activity logged prior to February 2020. (Note: To view your Nintendo 3DS and Wii U play activity, you’ll need to link your Nintendo Network ID (NNID) to your Nintendo Account.)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>-<strong>Check in at Events</strong> – You can use the app to check in at official Nintendo stores and events and earn related rewards! Your check-in activity will also be accessible within the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The addition of the storefront app comes as Nintendo updates its financials for Q2 2026, confirming that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">Switch 2 has already sold over 10 million units worldwide</a>. It's also increased its forecast for the remainder of the financial year from 15 million units to 19 million units.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the ways Nintendo builds relationships with its consumers. As part of this, he revealed some updated data about the player numbers within the company's ecosystem as of 30th September 2025.</p>
<p>There are currently <strong>400 million</strong> Nintendo Accounts, and in terms of active Switch Online memberships, there are <strong>34 million users</strong>. Nintendo mentions how there are also <strong>128 million</strong> "annual playing users", further noting:</p>
<p>"The number of annual playing users refers to the number of Nintendo Accounts, out of all Nintendo Accounts registered to a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 system, that used Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 software one or more times during the 12-month data aggregation period. The count does not include use of services such as Nintendo eShop. Past usage data is collected when hardware is connected to the internet, so the results are revised retroactively."</p>
<figure data-uuid="5ba0fd5ff9c00"><a title="Switch Online" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5ba0fd5ff9c00/switch-online.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo says it will continue to bring its entertainment to an "ever-wider audience". In the same briefing, the president noted how the company is extending beyond dedicated video game platforms with movies and videos, character merchandise, mobile apps, and real-world experiences such as the Nintendo Museum, theme parks and annual Live events.</p>
<p>There were no specific updates attached to this data about future plans for Switch Online content or the Nintendo Classics library going forward, but the company has been regularly updating this subscription service with retro games, extra bonuses and even special apps. Next year, it will bolster the service with the Virtual Boy library.</p>
<p>Nintendo Accounts and the Switch Online service also give users access to online play and other features such as GameChat. You can see all of this in action in the video above.</p>

<p>The Mario and Zelda movies are just the start</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="5bc86a535252d"><a title="Super Mario Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bc86a535252d/super-mario-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's movie business is already booming following the release of the Mario Movie in 2023, which was a global box office hit.</p>
<p>Since then, it's announced a live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> film, and more recently lifted the lid on <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (a follow up to the first animated Mario Movie). It's also got Nintendo Pictures and Nintendo Stars helping out with the expansion of video and movie content, and Shigeru Miyamoto has been working closely with the current movie projects.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the plan is beyond this, the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a> has now teased there's even more on the way with a simple graphic. The aim is to build a framework for a "consistent release cadence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following up on the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023, we have The Super Mario Galaxy Movie scheduled for release in 2026, and the live-action movie of The Legend of Zelda planned for 2027.</p>
<p>We are continuing to prepare for the ongoing release of movies in the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="de5d4c8cc9d82"><a title="Nintendo Movies" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de5d4c8cc9d82/nintendo-movies.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted in the graphic above, the next movie is The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, due out in April 2026. This will be followed by The Legend of Zelda movie, which is scheduled for 2027. The main characters for the Zelda movie have been cast, but we don't know much else about it at this stage.</p>

It's even led to the Japanese firm decreasing its overall sales forecast for this particular system.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how long the original family of Switch systems will be supported for, ultimately, it comes down to certain market factors. And even though it's selling less overall, sales are still maintaining a steady pace even after the Switch 2's launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wqpmvi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's what Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">the company's support of the original Switch</a> going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there's no end-of-life date or anything similar (<em>at least for now</em>), and the original hybrid system will still be available to purchase in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously confirmed future support of the system with upcoming releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> (both due out in 2026), and even a major update scheduled for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, there's still more than enough time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">for the Switch to topple the DS</a> as Nintendo's best-selling system of all time. The only console ahead of it at that point would be Sony's PlayStation 2, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/sorry-nintendo-but-it-doesnt-look-like-switch-will-overtake-ps2-as-the-best-selling-console-of-all-time?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">but the two devices are currently about six million sales apart</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo's systems haven't always had the best third-party support, but the Switch 2 has got off to an incredibly strong start with developers and publishers you might not have even expected to see once upon a time now bringing major IP to this new hardware.</p>
<p>The firm has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-highlights-strong-third-party-relationships-ahead-of-switch-2-reveal">acknowledged this strong support</a> once again in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial results briefing</a>, with Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa mentioning how the Switch 2 officially has the "largest third-party software lineup" ever for new Nintendo hardware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Not only have we already seen multiple hit first-party titles, but we have also had many software publishers on board from the very beginning, resulting in the most extensive launch-year lineup out of any of our dedicated video game platforms."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it's early days in the system's life, Furukawa further notes how software publishers have already released a "rich lineup of titles" catering to both "gamers and families". Attached to his comments is a graphic, highlighting the many third-party games that have been released and announced for the Switch 2 so far. This also includes some indie hits.</p>

<p>As we've now seen, Switch 2 sales have seemingly exceeded Nintendo's expectations, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">after shifting 10.36 million units</a> (as of 30th September 2025) and becoming the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware to date". This has also reportedly resulted in a slump in Switch sales, with Nintendo cutting back its forecast of the original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">has now revealed</a> how 84% of Nintendo Switch 2 players transitioned across from the original Switch systems. This was not only "early adopters" of the original Switch hardware, but also consumers who began playing the Switch at "various points of its lifecycle".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wqpmvi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Consumers who purchased Nintendo Switch between its launch in 2017 and the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 have been uniformly migrating to Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see in the slide below, 16% of Switch 2 players are completely "new players". Below this is a breakdown of Switch 2 owners and the time frame when they purchased the original Switch, according to Nintendo's internal data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7e14691bdbb61"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e14691bdbb61/switch-2.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's original Switch system <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">has now sold more than 154 million units</a>, which shows there are still plenty of players out there who have not yet made the shift across to the Switch 2, but likely will at some stage during the new unit's lifecycle.</p>
<p>Furukawa also notes how this data illustrates how existing Switch players are "smoothly transitioning to the Nintendo Switch 2", and allowing Nintendo to maintain relationships with players "across platform generations". Admittedly, it should probably come as no surprise that many of Switch 2's early adopters are existing Switch players, but it's still interesting to see the exact percentage.</p>
