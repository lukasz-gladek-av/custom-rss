<p>Both versions!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo followed up on its recently 'Close to You' short with another version that confirmed the presence of <strong>Pikmin</strong>, the company annoyingly kept it locked to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore, because both versions of the film – Pikmin and invisible Pikmin – have been uploaded to YouTube in one 8-minute-long video. Nice!</p>
<p>In case you happened to miss the whole thing, Close to You was uploaded with no warning and depicted a young child happily playing about with objects that seemed to be moving on their own. With some familiar background music, however, many had deduced that this simply <em>must</em> be Pikmin-related in some way.</p>
<p>Turns out it was! The video was uploaded to Nintendo Today!, but updated to show that the moving objects were actually being manipulated by lots and lots of Pikmin.</p>
<p>Many (including us) had hoped that this might be some indication of something more from the Pikmin franchise, but it was subsequently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sorry-nintendos-recent-pikmin-videos-arent-hinting-at-something-more">confirmed to be the first project from Nintendo Pictures</a>, the video production team previously known as Dynamo Pictures. The same company had also produced several Pikmin shorts back in the mid 2010s.</p>
<p>Having said that, Nintendo has just recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> will be receiving a free content update on Switch, adding in new Pikmin designs, a photo mode, and more. Pretty cool, huh? So we guess it wasn't all for show then.</p>
