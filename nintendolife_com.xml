<p>Brace Yourself Games is continuing its stellar lineup of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> crossover DLC with a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/everhood">Everhood</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>The succinctly named 'Everhood Music Pack' adds four new tracks to the falling notes rhythm game, all of which will be available to purchase separately or as a bundle. The DLC is now live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/57784/Rift__Everhood_Music_Pack/">Steam</a>, and the developers have announced that it will be falling onto Switch "at a later date" — so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Here are the four tracks from the RPG mash-up series that you'll find in this new wave of crossover bonus content:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Final Battle" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Feisty Flowers" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Revenge" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Why Oh You Are LOVE" by Dancefloor is Lava</li>
</ul>
<p>To see in the new releases in style, Brace Yourself Games is also adding a <em>free</em> Rhythm Rift, 'Powers of Destruction' by Cazok, for good measure.</p>
<p>This crossover DLC follows similar collaborations with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pizza_tower">Pizza Tower</a> and Hatsune Miku, and it looks like there's even more to come — which is exciting, because the base game is really rather good. We called Rift of the NecroDancer "a smart, stylish remix of what rhythm games can be" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/rift-of-the-necrodancer">our review</a>, which you can check out in full below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nintendo recently updated its music app on mobile devices, and this week it has released a new update for its Switch Parental Controls app.</p>
<p>According to the patch notes, this bumps it up to <strong>Version 2.2.0</strong> and it comes with a handful of updates to improve the overall experience. One, in particular, improves the 'Play Activity' display. Here are the full patch notes (via the App Store):</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls - Version 2.2.0 (August, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The play activity display has been improved.</li>
<li>The "Parental Controls Tips" section has been added to the bottom of the alerts menu.</li>
<li>Other small improvements have also been made.</li>
</ul></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows a major update in May, adding Switch 2 support to the system - including settings related to the GameChat feature, and various other extended features like the ability to extend daily play-time limits:</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls - Version 2.0.0 (May, 2025)</h3>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 systems are now supported</p>
<p>・ Nintendo Switch 2 systems can now be linked to the app.</p>
<p>・ Settings related to the GameChat feature have been added. If you allow your child to use GameChat, you can manage which friends they're approved to chat with and decide when they can use video chat.</p>
<p>More settings and features for supervising gameplay have been added</p>
<p>・ Extend the daily play-time limit.</p>
<p>・ Set play-time limits for linked systems as well.</p>

<p>・ Link up to eight Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch systems to the app.</p>
<p>Other small improvements and design updates have been made as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a refresher, this app is designed to allow parents to monitor their child's use of the Switch and Switch 2. It allows users to set play-time limits, customise online features including communication, set limits online, and decide what games can be played.</p>
<p>This update follows on from the announcement of a new Mario line for kids last week, which includes a new app for Switch and mobile devices. You can find out more in our recent coverage:</p>

<p>"The "Arcade Archives" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpieces that built a generation for video games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This game is priced at <strong>$14.99 USD</strong> on Switch, and costs <strong>$16.99 USD</strong> on the Switch 2 (or your regional equivalent). Once again, it's available today.</p>
