<p>We at Nintendo Life are on the lookout for someone to join our Video Production team.

Those wishing to shoot their shot will need to submit a three to five-minute face-to-camera video application in which you tell us a bit about yourself, share your favourite Nintendo franchises (and an obscure pick), and let us know anything else about you and your work — including some recent examples!</p>
<p>If all of this sounds very much up your street, head over to the <a href="https://apply.workable.com/hookshot/j/9B75C3E03D/">job listing</a> for the full list of requirements and desired skills.
