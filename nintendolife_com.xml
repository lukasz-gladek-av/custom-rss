Now, a new Nintendo patent filed in April and published this week has ignited rumours about Nintendo DS games potentially returning in the future.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613">Mike Odyssey on social media (via GoNintendo)</a>, the three methods of dual-screen gaming detailed include "Dual Screen (Parent and Child Screens), Single Screen Mode (Picture in Picture) and Switch Mode (Switch between Screens)". You can <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3ZAZvTXYAACnrb?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096">read the abstract and see each image</a> in the post:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gzhint&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The Nintendo DS library previously appeared on Wii U's Virtual Console service. It featured over 30 games and supported touch interaction on the system's GamePad. Considering this particular collection has already appeared on a Nintendo online service, it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if it did resurface at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a patent, so it doesn't necessarily guarantee anything is in the pipeline for the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library, and it could just be Nintendo going about its usual business. If we do hear anything else about this latest discovery, we'll let you know.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action-switch-the-balatro-of-pinball-games.1328623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon’s Tilt</a> deservedly received praise for its occult-themed gameplay, with many deeming it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">worthy spiritual successor</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/tg16/devils_crush">Devil’s Crush</a>. Now, sole developer WIZNWAR is back with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a>, a cyberpunk-inspired twist that improves upon its predecessor in almost every conceivable way. Simply put, this is one of the greatest pinball games ever made.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a> managed to pull in players who have never even entertained the idea of playing poker, then Xenotilt has the power to do the same for pinball – it’s remarkably approachable while being <em>incredibly</em> difficult to put down once it's got a hold of you. In combining straightforward mechanics with a near-constant stream of points topping up your high score, you’ll find the desire to have “just one more go” almost impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Set on a single ‘table’ (which is themed to look like a spaceship of sorts), the aim is simple: score as many points as you can with your three allocated balls. Split between three distinct tiers, the table houses a selection of boss characters that you’ll need to vanquish to gain huge chunks of points.</p>
<p>You achieve this by battering them with your ball via carefully aimed shots from the flippers, or by firing from auto-turrets. You activate these (providing you have ammo) by ‘cradling’ the ball on one of the flippers and pressing ‘down’. The turrets immediately lock onto enemies both big and small, and it’s a great way to clear the field and give yourself some more room.</p>
<p>Like other pinball games, you can also nudge the table to coax the ball into moving in specific directions, either to hit an enemy, grab a jackpot, or prevent yourself from falling into oblivion. Nudging too often within a short period of time can lead to a game over, so use this sparingly!</p>
<p>There's <em>endless</em> opportunities to ramp up your score, and if you’re able to maintain your combo multiplier, you’ll soon find that you’re able to break through the million-point barrier, perhaps even the billion. This is perfectly doable on ‘Normal Mode’, but if you opt for ‘EX Mode’, you can occasionally enter bonus areas completely separate from the main table. These offer up massive rewards, and one is even a quaint little spin on the game of snooker – it’s great fun.</p>
<p>It also looks the part too, with pixel art sprites, neon colours, and gloriously outrageous effects combining to create a stunning symphony of light and sound. It can sometimes be difficult to keep track of things in the default view, but Xenotilt also supports TATE mode, which looks awesome whether you’re playing on the OLED Model or the Switch 2. Similarly, the music is inspired, and I guarantee that at least one of the tracks will get stuck in your head long after you step away from the table.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played a pinball game before, then Xenotilt might well be the only one you’ll ever need. Heck, even if you don't <em>like</em> pinball, I suspect playing this might very well change your mind – it's mercilessly addictive from the get-go. Give it a shot and you’ll soon succumb to its will.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take a look</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix has released a new side-by-side comparison video for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>. Not only do we get a look at the game's opening cutscene on the Switch 2 in docked mode, but alongside this is a direct comparison to the same moment on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Square Enix previously confirmed Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will run at a "stable 30 frames per second" on the Switch 2, while offering "smooth performance" and some "crisp visuals".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187149 @ 1760850849 -->
<p>Other details about the Switch 2 version haven't been revealed just yet, but the first impressions of this version have been relatively positive so far. The game's director has also recently gone into detail about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">how the team made this version look so "great"</a> while praising Nintendo's new device as a "truly amazing piece of hardware".</p>

<p>Square Enix mentioned last month how it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">intends to release a demo for the Switch 2 version</a> of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade by the end of this year, so if you're still unsure about it, this might help ahead of the full game's arrival on 22nd January 2026.</p>
