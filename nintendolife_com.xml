<p>Become a dressmaker</p>

<figure data-uuid="40062ef98b2c1"><a title="Magical Craft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40062ef98b2c1/magical-craft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Imagineer</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Imagineer and developer syn Sophia (the team behind Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_2_-_fashion_forward">Style Savvy</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_3_-_styling_star">New Style Boutique</a> series) announced a new Switch dressmaking game called <strong>Magical Craft</strong>. It's already been released in Japan, and now, in an update, an ESRB listing has surfaced.</p>
<p>No local release has been announced just yet, but it seems we could be getting some news soon. The developer is the same Japanese team behind the 2023 Marvelous Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fashion_dreamer">Fashion Dreamer</a>. It also more recently helped Imagineer with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3</a>.</p>
<p>In this title, you gather fabrics, motif patterns and other items to make dresses, with the ability to "freely customize" a one-of-a-kind dress - with over 100,000 possible designs. To complete each dress, you'll play through mini-games featuring four kinds of sewing magic, and your villagers can then wear them.</p>
<p>Here's an official description regarding the game's protagonist and story (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dressmaking-adventure-game-magical-craft-neko-to-mahou-no-dress-announced-for-switch">via Gematsu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story unfolds in the tranquil village of Frune. The protagonist, a young girl named Lilia, begins her journey as a dressmaker, using the “sewing magic” she inherited from her grandmother. As she fulfills requests from the villagers and works toward becoming a legendary dressmaker, her everyday life of dressmaking begins."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we hear any updates about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>And it's "no comment" on "why separate SKUs were not possible"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="06fa2bb960801"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/06fa2bb960801/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of the superhero workplace comedy game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> on Switch and Switch 2 hasn't exactly panned out as expected.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, there has been a lot of back-and-forth over the past week about censorship in the Nintendo versions of the game. It resulted in the developer AdHoc Studio sharing multiple comments, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">Nintendo issued a formal statement</a>.</p>
<p>The previous update from the studio said the plan was to "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/people-have-a-right-to-be-pd-dispatch-dev-says-it-intends-to-address-at-least-some-censored-switch-content">address at least some of the censored content</a>" in the Switch and Switch 2 releases going forward. Now, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57271-dispatch-devs-say-uncensored-physical-switch-release-not-possible-can-t-comment-on">GoNintendo</a> has asked about the possibility of a "fully uncensored" physical version of the game on Nintendo platforms, but apparently, this won't be happening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GoNintendo:</strong> Unfortunately the answer isn’t one we hoped for. Our point of contact told us there is <em>“no possibility for a physical version to be released without the adjusted content.”</em> They also went on to say that the discussion isn’t <em>“currently relevant as there are no announcements regarding a physical release at this time.”</em> That is very much true, but you might remember that in our interview with Natalie Herman, Lead Producer on Dispatch, we asked about the potential for a physical release. Herman responded by saying, <em>“Let’s just say we’ve dreamed of Dispatch in a shiny red case. We have a lot of physical media fans on our team.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same site also asked about the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">singular worldwide release discussion</a>" doing the rounds online and reportedly got the following response back from AdHoc's PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“AdHoc is legally unable to provide further comment on why separate SKUs were not possible for different regions.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there are any other significant developments or comments made, we'll provide an update. You can find out more about Dispatch and the censored content in the Switch versions of the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review and previous stories</a> here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Following a special Nintendo Direct broadcast last week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, Nintendo is now celebrating the series on its music app this week with the release of the 3DS soundtrack.</p>
<p>This 3DS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> game was locally released in 2014. The soundtrack contains a <em>whopping</em> <strong>210 tracks</strong>, with a runtime of 3 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Oh Mii oh my! Songs from the Nintendo 3DS game Tomodachi Life are now available on the Nintendo Music app... Featuring tracks such as Afternoon on the Island, Mii Apartments, and more."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka (who was recently credited for music in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>) and former Nintendo composer Asuka Itō, who contributed to multiple other Nintendo projects throughout the 3DS generation.</p>

<p>As usual, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription to listen to the soundtrack on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> mobile app. If you didn't catch last week's Direct about the new Switch game, be sure to check out our previous coverage. This new title launches this April.</p>
