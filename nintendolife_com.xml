<figure data-uuid="27101ee173e6e"><a title="Pokémon FireRed Version" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27101ee173e6e/pokemon-firered-version.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the joys for many trainers during the earlier generations of Pokémon was giving the main character and their rival a rude or downright inappropriate name. In the Switch eShop versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a>, it seems there have been some updates to this.</p>
<p>As reported by Kotaku, you'll either have to get <em>really</em> creative now, or there's a good chance the game will override whatever you've input and instead give you a generic name. Here's a sample of some of the words that won't fly:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkutqzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Kotaku</em> has verified that some words, such as “d**k,” “p***y,” “s**t,” and even the f-slur are replaced by names like “Gary” or “Janne.” This doesn’t seem to extend to some milder words, however, as “hell” and “damn” were not replaced."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This update appears to impact Pokémon names as well. One obvious theory suggests the update is to prevent users from flooding social media with screenshots and footage containing offensive language. This also wouldn't be the best look, as Pokémon is meant to be a family-friendly experience for all ages.</p>
<p>As many trainers have highlighted, this confirms these classic Game Boy Advance releases have actually been edited for this special release. There have also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-version-gives-you-the-mystic-ticket-and-aurora-ticket">some other updates...</a></p>

<p>Well, Nintendo kindly sent one over to Nintendo Life Towers and we can confirm that it is indeed a Switch 2 Pro Controller — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a pad we absolutely love</a> — now with some pleasantly subtle RE-detailing. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Back in the day, sure, we were <em>all about</em> the gorily OTT RE chainsaw controller for GameCube, but two decades on? We're a little more sophisticated than we used to be, perhaps. We don't <em>need</em> blood splatter over every prong of our pad, and this new one could sit on the side quite comfortably without alarming pets or family members.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at those little details, courtesy of our lovely video chap Alex, shall we? First, some close-ups, then a handful of moody shots that may well have been snapped in a Raccoon City warehouse! Or possibly Alex's garage:</p>


<p>Tasty, no? Itchy, right?...</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing how it compares to the regular Pro Controller colour-wise (it <em>is</em> a little different), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjhZXoQ8OhI">check out Alex's short below</a>, and our review of the non-Evil version.</p>
<p><em>Let us know below if you've picked up one of these pads.</em></p>
