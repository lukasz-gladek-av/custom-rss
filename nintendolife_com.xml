And folks, it's looking and sounding <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>This is the third Hyrule Warriors game and is completely canonical, set long before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Taking place during the Imprisoning War, it follows Zelda after she's been transported back in time, basically filling in the gaps on what the princess was doing while she was stuck in the past.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>For our very own PJ O'Reilly, it's probably the best Hyrule Warriors game to date, with near-perfect performance, deliriously fun combat, and a pretty solid story, the only downside is that the maps are a little safe. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PJ's 9/10 review</a> concludes that "Lessons have been learned from both Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it."</p>

<p>But of <em>course</em> we're not the only ones who have covered the game. While some outlets are holding back until launch day (due to embargo restrictions), there are plenty of critics willing to share their thoughts on Age of Imprisonment.</p>
<p>Let's start near the top, shall we? <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/">RPG Site</a> is equally as glowing as us on the game, rewarding it a <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">9/10</a>, with reviewer James Galizio even calling it "a sleeper hit for my personal game of the year." The story strikes a good balance between Zelda and the other characters, and the game is stuffed full of the best Musou combat to date:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Age of Imprisonment isn't just a great Zelda spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire Zelda series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming down a notch, <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/">CGMagazine</a>'s Chris de Hoog awards Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">an 8.5/10</a> and an Editor's Choice, calling the story "a fulfilling complement" to TOTK, with particular praise given to the blend of the mainline game's combat with the Warriors formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> had me hooked for its entire 30-hour+ quest, always torn between wanting to see what happened next in the story and seeking out the components to unlock new features for the characters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another outlet praising the game's combat is <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/">VGC</a>, with friend of the site and NL contributor Chris Scullion awarding Zelda's Musou outing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">a 4/5</a>. If you're still worried about the frame rate, then here's another review stating that "noticeable" dips below 60fps are "rare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat is the best in the Hyrule Warriors series to date, and once you’ve reached the credits, about 18-20 hours in, there’s still a hell of a lot to do thanks to a large map filled with side-quests, unlockable characters, and other missions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TJ Denzer over at <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/">Shacknews</a> joins the performance cheers with <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/146650/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-score">an 8/10 review</a>, but is less enthusiastic about the sidequests and music. However, the combat is once again the star (we're also <em>big</em> fans of that headline, 'Ultrahanding out beatdowns'):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trying out Switch Skills and Sync Attacks between practically every pair of characters were some of my favorite things in this game and I hope Koei Tecmo tries something like them in future games..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slipping into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">7/10</a> scores we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">GameSpot</a>'s Richard Wakeling, who says that performance issues "are almost completely absent". The downsides come in the form of an inconsequential story and a lack of mission variety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story doesn't feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor's performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, Age of Imprisonment marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/">Gamesradar+</a>'s Oscar Taylor-Kent is a little more muted, awarding the game a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">3/5</a> citing "underutilized" spaces and "bland maps" with many missions lacking "depth", but combat is "sharply improved" compared to previous Hyrule Warriors games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I have more fun revisiting the less fully featured Age of Calamity, something has gone amiss. They did call it Age of Imprisonment, I suppose – but I wish they'd let me off the leash a little. Zelda's beam sword hungers for more."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is sitting on a respectable <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">78 on Metacritic from 52 reviews</a> (at the time of writing this), but that number will change over the coming days. OpenCritic sits at a similar <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19291/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">77 but from only 18 reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Still, you'll be able to judge for yourself when Age of Imprisonment launches on Switch 2 on <strong>6th November 2025</strong>. What a treat, hey?</p>

<p>Thought Nintendo had forgotten about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>? Think again! December's big release has just landed a brand-new trailer titled 'Survive' and, expectedly, it's still looking awesome.</p>
<p>Now, the trailer itself is only a little over a minute long, and you will have seen a lot of the footage before, but there are still some brief new snippets for those who have been going through every previous reveal with a fine-tooth comb.</p>
<p>We get a glimpse at some cool-looking psychic platforms, mysterious jungle vehicles, cutscene dogfights and more of that open desert area that we know we'll be speeding around on Vi-O-La. There's also a slightly different look at a fight with a pack of wolves, plenty of dramatic locales and Samus doing yet another <strong>Akira</strong> slide — because we can never get enough of <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>In short, things are still being kept pretty securely under wraps — hey, it's not like the game comes out <em>one month today</em> or anything... What we do know is that the long-awaited adventure is looking mighty fine. Let's just keep those fingers crossed that it can live up to the anticipation.</p>
