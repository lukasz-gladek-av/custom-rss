<p>Breaking records in less than a week</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a6181ef1adbe/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo shared its first official sales data for the Switch 2 – confirming the new hybrid system had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide"</a> in just the first four days, making it the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware within this amount of time.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the video game firm has revealed this new device is also the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware in the US" in four days. This was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">reported by IGN</a> – with the outlet also told "Switch 2 sales in all regions were approximately twice those of the Nintendo Switch 1 across both consoles' first four days on the market". Nintendo has not provided specific sales figures for this region.</p>
<p>This follows reports about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">system's positive start in locations like the UK</a>, France and Spain. Unsurprisingly, the launch is also benefiting certain franchises such as Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which has now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">surpassed five million lifetime sales</a> just a week later.</p>
<p>It's still early days for the Switch 2, and there were obviously some concerns about pricing and supply in the lead-up, but based on the official sales updates so far, it appears to be an excellent start. Nintendo will bolster the new device's software library next month with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and it's likely to welcome even more consumers to the Switch 2 family with games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> later this year.</p>
