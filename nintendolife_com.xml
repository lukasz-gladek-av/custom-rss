<p>Arriving on Switch next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you cast your mind back to the early days of the Switch eShop, before the storefront was swamped by slop and rip-offs, you might recall <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_chef_brigade">Battle Chef Brigade</a> — a weird fusion of cooking sim and action RPG all wrapped up in a sweet anime-inspired art style. It was a lovely little game from developer Trinket Studios, and what do you know, the team is back with something that looks equally intriguing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_suit_aces">Battle Suit Aces</a> is a sci-fi RPG that mixes the bold visuals of old-school mech anime with some particularly deep-looking card combat. It boasts the same visual style as its predecessor and another interesting mash-up of gameplay styles</p>
<p>Arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th October</strong>, Battle Suit Aces will see you assemble a rag-tag team of space explorers and set out into the stars in search of 'Relic Suits' — those big mech-like guys promised by the title. There's a certain visual-novel-ness to how the story unfolds, and you can catch up with your team between missions by preparing meals or hanging in communal areas — hello? <strong>Persona</strong>? — but the missions themselves look to be the big selling point.</p>
<p>The game's card-based combat appears to be full of tactical potential, as you put together a frontline of mech pilots, each with their own abilities and goals. Cards can be moved around to target more foes or swapped out for different objectives, and you'll build up your deck with even more hunky anime action heroes as you progress through the story.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screenshots from developer Trinket Studios:</p>

<p>Battle Suit Aces is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/battle-suit-aces-switch/">North American eShop</a> for <strong>$24.99</strong>. It'll be arriving at a particularly stacked time for Switch releases, but may end up being one to watch for those after a slice of something different.</p>

<figure><a title="ShadowCast 3 / Covert Dock 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f10fb3758b790/shadowcast-3-covert-dock-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Genki - Human Things</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Genki (which got into a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-and-accessory-maker-genki-reach-settlement-in-switch-2-lawsuit">wee bit of trouble with Nintendo</a> recently) has teased two upcoming products: the <strong>ShadowCast 3</strong> and the <strong>Covert Dock 3</strong>.</p>
<p>The ShadowCast 3 is the next iteration of – you guessed it – the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/shadowcast-2?_pos=1&amp;_sid=d19e4fee4&amp;_ss=r">ShadowCast 2</a>, which allowed users to connect their Switch to a laptop or iPad for accessible gaming and capture on the go. It came with its limitations, with a recommended capture quality of 1080p60 for the best results. As such, while we can't confirm for definite right now, it seems reasonable to assume the ShadowCast 3 will allow for 4K capture at 60fps – perfect for the Switch 2, then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Covert Dock 3 is the new iteration of... oh, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2?_pos=3&amp;_sid=6f92cbe00&amp;_ss=r">you get it</a>. This thing is pretty nifty and would essentially bundle a 4K HDMI dock into a portable console charger, allowing you to connect your Switch in its handheld configuration to a TV without the need for a full-size dock. Sadly, the second version isn't compatible with the Switch 2, so that's presumably where the Covert Dock 3 comes into play.</p>

<p>Genki has released a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanthings/trilogy">Kickstarter</a> page for the two products which will go live within days at this point. Price has not yet been confirmed, but an initial image at least gives us a good glimpse at what each product will look like. The Covert Dock 3 is on the left and looks remarkably similar to the Dock 2, albeit with a new colour scheme, while the ShadowCast 3 on the right is a pretty significant departure from the previous version.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye out for more details on these new products and let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>Hey, listen!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Zelda: Ocarina of Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22378a2e0cf02/zelda-ocarina-of-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lego released its first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>-themed Lego set last year after ongoing rumours, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/lego-zelda-deku-tree-set-rumours-resurface-online">turned out to be accurate</a>. Now, in an update, there's a new rumour doing the rounds about the next set in this particular series.</p>
<p>Instead of a hybrid set bringing together two different games, this next one is rumoured to be based solely on Link's N64 outing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. According to a story from <a href="https://youtu.be/b04dj4jMGgI?t=285">BrickTap</a> (<a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">via Brick Fanatics</a>), it will be a Ganondorf Diorama.</p>
<p>The product name, "which may not be final" as <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">highlighted by the same source</a>, is supposedly '77093 Ocarina of Time Ganondorf Diorama'. It will apparently contain 1003 pieces and is expected to be much cheaper than the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set as a result (which contains 2500 pieces). As for the launch, it's believed to be arriving in March of next year.</p>
<p>Again, this is strictly a rumour for now, but there would definitely be plenty of potential for a Ganondorf Diorama or at least something similar. He obviously has a huge role and plenty of scenes in Ocarina of Time, so it will be interesting to see what comes of this, if it is the real deal. The Zelda series' 40th anniversary is also taking place next year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-everything-announced-for-super-marios-40th-anniversary">and much like Mario</a>, big celebrations are expected.</p>
<p>If you haven't taken a look at the Great Deku Tree set just yet, be sure to read (or watch) our review. The 2-in-1 build allows you to create the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. At the time of its release, we called it a striking addition to Lego's growing line of Nintendo sets, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>
