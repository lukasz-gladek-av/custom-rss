<p>Plus, Mech Zangie-F returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ahead of her debut on <strong>15th October 2025</strong>, C. Viper gets the spotlight with a brand new gameplay trailer for Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>Available as part of the <strong>Year 3 Ultimate / Character Pass</strong>, C. Viper (or Crimson Viper) was originally introduced to the series in the 2008 entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>. She retains her signature moves such as Burning Kick, Thunder Dash, Knuckled Pursuit, and Seismic Hammer. A brand new move called Focus Force has also been introduced, allowing you to bring up a protective barrier before launching your counterattack.</p>
<p>In addition to her standard outfit, C. Viper will also boast her Street Fighter IV attire for those who want to inject a bit of nostalgia into their gaming. As for the new outfit, Capcom has provided two pieces of artwork in its recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/544495527868235881">blog</a> to give you a good glimpse at Viper in all her glory.</p>

<p>In addition to a brand new character, the Year 3 Pass also introduces an extra outfit for Zangief. This is based directly on Mech Zangie-F from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/marvel_super_heroes_vs_street_fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a>, though its overall design has been updated accordingly for this new release. It looks pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The additional outfit will be available on 15th October alongside C. Viper, but that's not all. Owners of the Year 3 Pass can also look forward to two addition characters in the coming months: Alex and Ingrid.</p>

<p>Ready for your Asterism Voyage?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Dragami Games has announced that its mecha strategy title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> will launch for Switch 2 on <strong>25th September</strong>. By Jove, that's today!</p>
<p>Relayer Advanced, which sees you assume the role of Starchildren in a battle against the alien Relayer, has already seen release on various other platforms since its debut back in 2022, and this snazzy new Switch 2 version comes complete with all previously released DLC and spin-off story content.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar, the 'Advanced' version is a souped-up take of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/relayer">Relayer</a> from March 2022 (the Advanced rejig launched the following October), which sits with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/relayer/">a Metascore of 77</a>. So, if you like SRPGs featuring big robots leathering chunks out of each other in space (and let's face it, who doesn't?), then it seems there's gonna be plenty of faces to get busy leathering for you.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the game's PR blurb, plus some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will command the "Stellar Gear" unit that the Starchildren board and battle against the "Relayer" forces. On stage, players will lead their troops to victory by making full use of such strategic systems as "Hate," which quantifies how easily enemies target you, "Skills" specific to jobs and characters, "Backstab," which launches pincer attacks, and "Big Bang," a special move.</p>
<p>This is the complete version that includes the main game as well as all previously released DLC.</p>
<p>Command a unit of "Stella Gear," humanoid weapons created using the technology of an ancient galactic civilization, and defend Earth from invasion by the mysterious lifeforms known as "Relayer."</p>
<p>There are a total of approximately 100 cutscenes that are played when units battle each other.</p>
<p>The stage maps are also rendered in high-quality full 3D.</p>
<p>There is also "Hate," which indicates how likely you are to be targeted by the enemy, a wide variety of skills, and special attacks such as the pincer attack "Backstab" and the special move "Big Bang."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as all of the above tweaks, the game also includes a full English dub alongside its Japanese vocals. Hooray!</p>
<p>There's no pricing on Nintendo's US site just yet, but in the UK it'll set you back £29.50.</p>

<p>Plus, new update roadmap revealed</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df46493c82381/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hot off the back of its Switch 2 release earlier this month, First Studio and Marvelous have released the first major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, bringing the game up to ver. 1.1.0.</p>
<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-switch-2-gyro-controls-confirmed-for-future-update">previously teased gyro mode</a> addition, the update also adds in a brand-new boss, various camera adjustments and a fair share of bug fixes to boot.</p>
<p>What's more, the studios have revealed the new Titanic Scion update roadmap, so we can get an idea of everything on the horizon. It's near-identical to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-roadmap-outlined">the one showcased earlier this month</a>, but it's always nice to know what's in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The free 'Iris Outfit' DLC will still land on 2nd October, followed by more new bosses and cosmetic items on 16th October. The 'Into the Abyss' Expansion Pack will then arrive as a paid add-on in November, before a batch of three bosses land for free in December.</p>

<hr>
<p>We had a decent enough time with Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion's mech combat when it launched on Switch 2, but felt that the whole thing was sullied by a less than perfect performance. Here's hoping that this update moves things in the right direction.</p>
