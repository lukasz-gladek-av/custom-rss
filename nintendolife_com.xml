<figure><a title="Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ad1f1337a4f7/masahiro-sakurai-on-creating-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qPqBilhEtI">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434">a Yahoo Japan interview</a> (geo-locked) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> lead and game dev extraordinaire Masahiro Sakurai has blown up in the West, with reports suggesting that the Kirby creator is advocating for generative AI. However, it seems the nuance of his comments have gotten a little lost in translation.</p>
<p>Translated quotes shared on social media suggested Sakurai saw AI as a solution to the issues facing developers of large-scale games, although prominent posters such as <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1936888173327433860">Stealth</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1936935928666501290">Genki</a> have since removed initial posts as more nuanced interpretations of his interview comments have been proposed.</p><p><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In the interview, when asked about the future of the games industry, Sakurai said he doesn't believe the current development model is sustainable due to the amount of time and work involved in producing the biggest games.</p>
<p>He followed this with comments on generative AI which were initially taken as endorsement, although as pointed out by others online, the tone is one of disappointment about the realities of AAA game dev and uncertainty about its future, not 'AI is the solution'. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">Jenny on Bluesky</a> sums it up like this:</p>
<figure><a title="jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬ Bluesky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9aaecc75c6c63/jenny-atmiinipah-subahibi-net-bluesky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For comparison and context around the blow-up, here's Google's stab at machine-translating the relevant section of the interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>While game development is becoming larger and more specialized and fragmented, the indie game market, which is made by one person or a small group of people, is also growing. What do you think about the future of the game market?</strong><br>
To be honest, it's impossible to tell what's going to happen in a moment. I think that if you try to make a large-scale game like the current one, it's too much work and it's not sustainable. I feel that we can't continue like this, but at the moment, the only effective solution I can think of is generative AI. I feel that we've reached a stage where we have to change the scheme, such as by using generative AI to improve work efficiency. And I think that we will enter an era where only companies that can respond well to this change will survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it looks like another example of machine-translated text not quite capturing the nuance of the comments or the context of the conversation. Given Sakurai's extensive dev experience (which he's channelled into his enormous and excellent video series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a>), having him suddenly extolling the virtues of AI-authored content would be something of a turn.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that he was just commenting on AI as a solution being proposed by some at a time when AAA game development is more costly and time-consuming than ever.</p>
<p>Sakurai is currently working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for Switch 2, the sequel to the GameCube racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, which is currently set to launch in '2025'.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Nintendo Racers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7725d4c79231/mario-kart-world-nintendo-racers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's no denying that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> packs a pretty impressive roster of racers (come on, 50 characters, <em>plus</em> costumes ain't bad), but we'd be foolish if we didn't pour one out for the familiar faces that were lost along the way. We're talking, of course, about the <del>Koopalings</del> wider Nintendo characters that got cosy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, but missed out on the starting line this time around.</p>
<p>Link, Isabelle, the Villagers and the Inklings no longer grace the character select screen in World, and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">Ouest-France</a>, producer Kosuke Yabuki explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>According to Yabuki-san, the Mario Kart World development team felt the line-up was already beefy enough, <em>without</em> Link and co. in tow. "As developers, it would have seemed incongruous to us to add characters from other games into this universe," he told the French outlet (via Google Translate), "And it didn't seem necessary to us, given everything we could already do with Mario".</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/this-is-it-nintendo-on-why-it-added-cow-into-mario-kart-world">Ask the Developer interview</a> gave us some insight into how excited the developers were to add the likes of Cow to the game, so it makes sense that the team would want to keep going with as many Mario regulars as possible. We'd be on that character select screen all day if they started adding lil guys from <em>every</em> Nintendo franchise, after all.</p>
<p>And, let's admit it, we've all gone crazy for some of these newbies, regardless of where they came from. "The reception has been so warm that it surprised even us," Yabuki-san told Ouest-France, "It definitely exceeded our expectations".</p>
<p>"We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this casting," Yabuki-san concluded, "But there are so many characters and so many costumes that every player is sure to find something to suit them".</p>
<p>Part of us assumed that Mario Kart would balloon into some sort of Smash-style 'Nintendo Kart' for the next entry, so it's actually pretty refreshing to see the Big N go in the opposite direction. And besides, who's choosing Link over Monty Mole?</p>

<figure><a title="Digital Foundry Is &quot;Happy&quot; With Switch 2, But Feels The Screen Is &quot;Problematic&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20b1277270269/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The tech boffins over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Digital Foundry</a> have delivered their final verdict on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">Switch 2</a>, and it's mostly positive—but the console's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">LCD screen</a> has been found wanting.</p>
<p>In his review, Digital Foundry boss and games media veteran Richard Leadbetter says that, overall, he's "happy" with Nintendo's new hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being significantly larger than Switch 1, the thinness of the handheld remains much the same, making it feel significantly less bulky than Steam Deck and other PC handhelds. Similarly, the bigger screen can make for a more immersive experience and colour reproduction is significantly improved over the original model. What’s also surprising – and highly appreciated – is the number of games that either run at native 1080p in handheld mode (like Mario Kart World, for example) or use DLSS to upscale to 1080p, delivering pleasing results.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter likes the hardware in general, taking time to praise the new Joy Con controllers and even citing the "little ‘feet’ on the bottom of the unit" as praise-worthy. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-are-you-excited-at-all-for-switch-2-gamechat">GameChat</a> also gets a positive appraisal. "This is the original Switch revised and refined into a generally more pleasing and more effective unit, delivering a proper generational upgrade with highly impressive efficiency."</p>

<p>However, the console's LCD display—<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/switch-2-launching-this-year-with-8-inch-lcd-screen-according-to-new-analyst-rumour">a point of contention even before the console was released</a>—proved "problematic in a number of ways" for the industry vet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo promised HDR, but an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 nits will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range experience with the signature HDR contrast and highlights almost completely absent in handheld play. Even more disappointing is motion quality: the Switch 2 LCD has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">blurring characteristics</a> that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch’s display. Side by side with the Switch OLED panel, the key problems with Nintendo’s choice for Switch 2 come into sharp focus – it’s simply nowhere near as good.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>There are clear problems with Switch 2’s VRR (variable refresh rate) functionality too. Now, in theory, we believe that there’s no reason why it should not work effectively. The Switch 2 Welcome Tour software includes a VRR showcase that demonstrates what we think is a 40-120Hz VRR window, but crucially it also reveals support for LFC – low frame-rate compensation – outside of that window. A fully featured VRR on Switch 2 is possible!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another minor grumble relates to the length of the supplied USB-C cables, which Leadbetter feels simply aren't long enough.</p>
