            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It’s no secret that I’ve not been the biggest hype-monster when it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. I’m not big on the idea of an open game being restricted to just a city, and the combat, whilst intriguing, left me apprehensive for how it would be executed.</p>
<p>Well, I got the chance to go and play the game on Switch 2 in the Eiffel Tower recently, courtesy of Nintendo UK and The Pokémon Company International, so I can now say a few things with far more confidence.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the real-time combat? It absolutely <em>slaps</em>. Game Freak has taken some real care and consideration into how the moves we’re all so familiar with should be adapted in order to fit within a real-time system, and it works wonders.</p>

<p>Every move has its own cooldown, much like the systems in the <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> games, and these vary depending on the strength of the move, as well as no doubt some other factors. Quick Attack, for example, is unsurprisingly fast to execute, and to recharge, making it a great way to dash in and swiftly poke an enemy without any real commitment.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the cooldowns, which is just as well, otherwise I’d be a fool for singing such praises. Toxic Spikes leaves <em>actual</em> toxic spikes on the ground, and the enemy Pokémon has to walk over them to be poisoned, so you not only have to use the attack, but lure them into the hazard’s hitbox, which adds another lovely extra layer to combat.</p>
<p>Similarly, some moves will leave a temporary area of effect in place, such as Whirlpool. These don't do major damage at first, but if you can corral the enemy into staying in place, that damage will creep up substantially. Protect-like moves have also changed and function more as a panic button than anything else; if you see an Alpha Houndoom charging up something massive, you can tactfully negate it with a single press of a button, which gives much more application to an otherwise one-note move.</p>

<p>Alpha Houndoom? Oh yes indeedy, Alpha Pokémon from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> are back, and bolder than ever. So bold, in fact, that it managed to hit my player character enough that I was whisked back to a Pokémon Centre in an area I wasn’t supposed to explore, and was told to fast travel back to the assigned locations <em>very quickly</em>.</p>
<p>I had an absolute blast taking this thing down, and had to rely on items a fair bit in order to eventually rase the sucker. I couldn’t just spam them though, oh no; if you use an item in combat, there’s a cooldown until you’re able to use another item from your bag, so you can’t just fully revive your entire party and cheese every encounter.</p>
<p>I also had a pop at a Rogue Mega Victreebel and its voluminous gullet. It was a fun fight, and definitely a nice change of pace, but I can’t help but feel it might have been a little more impactful if it hadn’t taken place entirely within a near-shapeless purple haze. I prefer to have some context for this stuff, and so to suddenly take the fight out of the usual playing field felt like a bit of a cheat.</p>

<p>Having said that, I’m not mad keen on the usual playing field either. Lumiose City is big, but <em>sweet mercy</em> is it dull. The towering buildings end up providing what is, from my limited time with the game, a series of wide-ish corridors to explore, perhaps with the occasional, more-open area. It just feels very samey and lame. I'm hopeful that we get to see more interesting environs in the full game, but what I've seen thus far doesn’t fill me with confidence.</p>
<p>On that note, the game is also fairly uninspiring from a visual standpoint; it runs very smoothly at 60fps, but the price of that is seemingly buildings made of flat walls with balconies and the like being nothing more than part of the models’ textures. It really is baffling and overwhelmingly disappointing that Pokémon games continue to fall short in the looks department, especially when you consider that historically (on handheld devices) they were graphical showcases many moons prior.</p>
<p>In fairness, the game doesn’t look <em>bad</em>, just dull and serviceable. This is probably due to the game also coming to Nintendo Switch, but the end result is, sadly, uninspiring. I’m hopeful that the combat will be enough to do a lot of the heavy lifting, but until we get our hands on Pokémon Legends: Z-A proper, hoping is all we’ve got.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Developer LilliLandia Games (which sits under Tencent Games) has revealed its first trailer for an upcoming Switch 2 life sim called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animula-nook">Animula Nook</a>. Yeah, we're not too keen on the name either, don't worry.</p>
<p>There's no release date for this one yet, but it'll be making an appearance at this week's Tokyo Game Show. The 4-minute long trailer does, however, give us quite a bit to work with, showcasing a whole bunch of CGI cutscenes along with a smattering of <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>-inspired gameplay. Visually at least, it looks pretty amazing.</p>
<p>What we're not quite to sold on right now is the actual gameplay. It looks a little slow, a little clinical, and there's a lot of information missing from the trailer. Where's the UI, for example? We can see scenes in which the main protagonist is decorating their home and garden, but how exactly is this being translated into gameplay?</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now, because there's a lot that we like about this. Hopefully its appearance at TGS will shed some more light on how the gameplay will actually function.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Discover a tiny yet immense world:</strong> Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</p>
<p><strong>- Collect beyond the ordinary:</strong> In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</p>
<p>-<strong>Build with everyday objects:</strong> Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Befriend the world’s tiny folk:</strong> This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</p>
<p><strong>- Define yourself in every detail:</strong> Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</p>
<p><strong>- Convenient creative tools:</strong> Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</p>

<figure><a title="HORI Wireless HORIPAD Turbo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a40167a4511b7/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer HORI has lifted the lid on its latest licensed Switch 2 controller, the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Wireless HORIPAD Turbo</a>. It's a colourful affair, with an overall design that looks uncannily close to Nintendo's official offering, but there are a couple of caveats that stop it from <em>quite</em> toppling the mighty Pro Controller.</p>
<p>But let's start with the positives. The Wireless HORIPAD Turbo boasts TMR sticks to reduce chances of the dreaded drift, full gyro control, mappable face and back buttons, a C Button, and a neat 'Button Lock' function to prevent you from accidentally hitting any of the middle buttons (+, -, Home and Screenshot) during particularly sweaty online matches. It also comes with its own HORI Button in the middle, which can be used for rapid inputs and setting up profile preferences.</p>
<p>A pretty appealing line-up, no? The black model cuts a very similar silhouette to Nintendo's Pro Controller (and is a drastic improvement over HORI's <a href="https://hori.co.uk/nsx-005/">wired counterpart</a>, if you ask us), but the Wireless Turbo offers a little bit of colour variation in its full lineup, with 'Aqua Cyan', 'Frost White', 'Shine Yellow' and 'Ruby Magenta' designs all available.</p>


<p>Naturally, this <em>isn't</em> a Pro Controller, so there are a few missing features in the Wireless Turbo if you're after a pad with the full range of Nintendo abilities. Like many third-party pads, this offering cannot be used to wake the Switch 2 from sleep, and there's no support for reading your amiibo. What's more, the Wireless Turbo doesn't contain an audio jack, and there's no HD Rumble either.</p>
<p>All that said, the Wireless HORIPAD Turbo <em>does</em> come at a cheaper price than the Pro Controller. The pad is currently listed on the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Japanese HORI website</a> for 7,980 yen (around £40 / $54), with a 'Winter 2025' release date. Of course, there's no guarantee that this price conversion will match the <em>actual</em> regional retail prices, but that's a good chunk cheaper than the £74.99 / $89.99 asking price for Nintendo's official offering.</p>
<p>The pad is now available to pre-order in Japan, so we can't imagine that a Western release will be far behind. If you want an even closer look at the colour range, you'll find HORI's 13-minute video rundown of the collection below.</p>
