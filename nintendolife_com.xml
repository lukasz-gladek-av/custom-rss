But if you're not keen on splashing out on the <strong>$66.99 / $99.99</strong> replica or its cheaper cardboard equivalent, then you <em>might</em> be in luck.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> kit lying around gathering dust, then you'll want to dig it out in the coming days. According to <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/nintendos-virtual-boy-classics-will-be-playable-on-labo-vr-headsets/">GamesBeat</a>, a Nintendo Treehouse staff member has confirmed that the cardboard peripheral will be compatible with Virtual Boy on NSO.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vmikzy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now just to be absolutely sure, we've reached out directly to Nintendo and will update this article once we get confirmation. But honestly, it kind of makes sense that Labo VR would be compatible, and hopefully this will make the prospect of playing Virtual Boy a little easier for current owners.</p>
<p>Released in 2019, the VR headset could be used with big-hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. Nintendo has not opted to utilise it in recent years, but the cardboard variant of the Virtual Boy headset has definitely taken some inspiration. It will launch alongside the full-fat replica for a more affordable <strong>£16.99 / $24.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you plan on using your Labo VR kit, then you'll need to consider that the Switch 2 simply won't fit inside the peripheral. So you'll need to stick with the OG Switch, but Virtual Boy will thankfully be compatible with both systems.</p>

<p>It's time to shoot some hoops</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The team-based competitive title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has received two major updates since it hit the court last August, and today Nintendo has released the game's first update of 2026.</p>
<p>This one is a much smaller patch. It bumps the game up to <strong>Version 1.2.1</strong>, and apparently addresses some issues to improve the overall game experience. Here's the full rundown, so if you've been encountering these problems during gameplay, they should no longer be a problem once you've performed this update:</p>
<h3>Drag x Drive Ver. 1.2.1 (Released February 3, 2026)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Fixed an issue where the effect of defensive pressure on opponents’ halfpipe shots was smaller than intended.</p>
<p>- Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This again follows two major updates. The previous one added Survival Tag across multiple modes and even released an update for the game's demo.</p>
<p>If you haven't already tried out this game on the Switch 2, check out our written review as well as our video review above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans. Add in some pals, and you've got a solid bit of fun for the price."</em></p>

<p>Are you feeling it?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="0f8fe0aa4ee94"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f8fe0aa4ee94/xenoblade-chronicles-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Monolith Soft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours about a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> release have started to circulate online today after a possible "leak" on the casting platform Spotlight.</p>
<p>The page of voice actor Caitlin Thorburn (who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qvb7f9/caitlin_thorburn_just_updated_her_spotlight_page/">voiced multiple roles in the second game</a>) has reportedly been updated to reference a "Xenoblade Chronicles" project due out in 2026. She's apparently reprising her role as KOS-MOS, who previously appeared in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/xenosaga_i_and_ii">Xenosaga</a> series.</p>

<p>So that's what's supposedly been uncovered. As for the legitimacy of this, it is just a rumour for now, but <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/monolith-soft-development-and-speculation-st.51/page-55#post-2165560">apparently the profile</a> can only be updated and edited by the person who is the subject of the page. Of course, it doesn't necessarily guarantee anything and could also be a mistake.</p>
<p>If this is a sign of a new Xenoblade game (or a returning one in some way or form), this wouldn't actually be the first time something like this has happened. Xenoblade fans have been quick to point out how a similar situation happened ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, when the Melia voice actor Jenna Coleman spoke about "another game" before an official announcement.</p>
<p>If we hear any updates, we'll let you know. Just keep in mind Nintendo or Monolith Soft haven't announced any new or returning Xenoblade Chronicles projects at this stage.</p>

<p>Following a delay last September</p>

<figure data-uuid="56cfcaf6b549d"><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56cfcaf6b549d/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last September, 2K Games and Gearbox Software announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> had been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">delayed for Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The plan was to spend a little extra time to deliver the "best possible experience" on Nintendo's new system, but it appears the plan has changed. In Take-Two's latest earnings results (the parent company of 2K Games), the Switch 2 version has been removed from the company's release schedule.</p>
<p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Variety, the "difficult decision" has been made to "pause development" on this particular version of the game. The team at Gearbox is instead focused on delivering "quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game".</p>
<p>This decision <em>won't</em> impact other Switch 2 projects, and 2K will continue to collaborate closely with Nintendo. Upcoming releases for Switch 2 include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pga-tour-2k25">PGA TOUR 2K25</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26</a>.</p>
<p>Before the most recent delay and cancellation of pre-orders, Borderlands 4 was meant to arrive on the Switch 2 in October 2025. This title was originally released on other platforms last September and while the shift to open world was praised, there were also reports of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/borderlands-4?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">console version's problematic performance</a> at the time.</p>

<p>As we enter February, Nintendo has today announced two more titles for the Switch Online's Game Boy library.</p>
<p>Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> Yoshi reveal, Nintendo seems to be continuing the Yoshi celebrations with the release of the 1991/92 puzzle-themed Game Boy title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/yoshi">Yoshi</a>. Alongside this, Nintendo has locally released the 1990/91 platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/balloon_kid">Balloon Kid</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the official Nintendo descriptions for both titles and you can check out the trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yoshi™</strong></p>
<p>Yoshi is an action/puzzle game starring Mario's trusty buddy Yoshi, who has been imprisoned in an egg. Now it's raining Goombas, Bloopers, and Boo Buddies, and you have to help Mario stop the airborne invasion. As the critters fall, catch them on trays. Stack two of a kind and they both disappear, or capture the whole bunch in between eggshells. When the eggshells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. To save the day, switch and shuffle, and don't let your piles get too high!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Balloon Kid™</strong></p>
<p>In the little town of Pencilvania, there lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother Jim would spend countless days filling the skies with their balloons. One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away.</p>
<p>As Alice, you must save your brother from peril. Float through eight different stages as you follow Jim's trail of balloons. Collect as many balloons as possible to earn bonuses. Test your piloting skills to avoid enemies, or let go of your balloons to face enemies on the ground. In BALLOON TRIP mode, compete for the highest score and move up the ranks. Take a big gulp of courage and give Alice a hand as she searches for her missing brother!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in case you're wondering, Japan is getting Yoshi and <strong>Balloon Fight GB</strong> this week. The second game, released exclusively in Japan in the year 2000, is a Game Boy Color version <a href="https://tcrf.net/Balloon_Kid/Balloon_Fight_GB">with some updates</a> such as a world map and the ability to save. You can see it in action in the trailer below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This title is an action game for the Game Boy Color released in 2000 on the Nintendo Power game rewriting system. You control Alice, who flies while holding on to a balloon, and chase after her younger brother who has been blown away by the wind. Clues to her brother's whereabouts are balloons left all over the stage. You will progress while avoiding various obstacles, including birds with sharp beaks and flying fish that appear from the sea. Sometimes you can even let go of the balloon and explore on land. In "Balloon Trip" mode, you can challenge yourself to see how long you can fly without hitting an obstacle.</p>
