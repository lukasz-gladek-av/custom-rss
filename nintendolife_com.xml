<p>Switch 2 physical is a Game-Key Card</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're planning on getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/digimon-story-time-stranger">Digimon Story Time Stranger</a> for the original Switch, in case you missed it, there'll be an upgrade similar to what Bandai Namco offered with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_sparking_zero">Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! ZERO</a>.</p>
<p>If you boot up the Switch version of the title on the Switch 2, you'll be able to download a free update that will give you graphical improvements, which are the equivalent of the Switch 2 version. Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When playing the Nintendo Switch version of Digimon Story Time Stranger on the Nintendo Switch 2 version...Graphics will be improved to the equivalent of the Nintendo Switch 2 version after downloading the update data."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="228312d27cadc"><a title="Digimon Story Time Stranger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/228312d27cadc/digimon-story-time-stranger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As previously noted, on Switch 2, you'll have access to 'Performance' and 'Quality' mode options, and if you return to the Switch version, the "graphics will revert" and these options will not be available. Here are the resolution and performance specs once again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On Nintendo Switch 2, players will have the option of playing in Quality Mode (4K HDR, up to 30FPS docked; Full HD, up to 30FPS handheld) or Performance Mode (Full HD, up to 60FPS docked and handheld)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to online listings, the Switch 2 version of this title is a Game-Key Card while the original Switch version is a full physical release. So if you're a collector, the Switch release might be your best option when the game launches on these platforms in July.</p>

<p>"Stop an alien threat from destroying all human life"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last year, during The Game Awards, it was announced the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/saber-interactive">talented team at Saber Interactive</a> would be reviving the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/turok-origins">Turok</a> IP with a new game known as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/turok-origins">Turok: Origins</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an update during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo's latest Partner Showcase</a>, it's been revealed the new sci-fi shooter (featuring both first and third-person perspectives) will be releasing on the Switch 2 later this year in <strong>fall 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's some information about the intergalactic story, which will see you fighting for survival against a terrifying alien threat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Turok: Origins,</em> players will take on the mantle of the ancient Order of the Turok, heroic guardians of unimaginable power locked in a battle for survival against ferocious creatures and a terrifying alien threat that seeks to destroy all human life in the galaxy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guardians will be able to fight solo or in online co-op as they take on a variety of creatures, dinosaurs and bosses across a range of environments. There will also be the ability to unlock and upgrade advanced weaponry and DNA Powers.</p>
<p>Saber is the same team that worked on and helped out with multiple ports during the Switch generation including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/world_war_z">World War Z</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crysis_remastered">Crysis Remastered</a>.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a fan of the Goemon and Mystical Ninja series, there was a rather exciting 40th anniversary announcement shared during this week's Japanese Partner Direct.</p>
<p>Konami and the <a href="https://x.com/M2_game/status/2019429197727572111">emulation experts at M2</a> are teaming up to release <strong>Ganbare Goemon Daishuugo!</strong> - a new retro collection coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms in Japan on <strong>2nd July 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This package will include 13 titles from across the series. It includes releases from the Famicom, Super Famicom and Game Boy era. Here's the full list (<a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2026/02/japanese-fans-are-getting-a-ganbare-goemon-collection-and-weve-never-been-more-jealous">thanks, <strong>Time Extension</strong></a>):</p>

<p>Once again, the catch is that this collection has only been announced for Japan. If there are any updates regarding a local release or online pre-orders, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>In some related news, during the local Partner Direct, Konami announced a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a> and it's available now on the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is now available. If you are wondering how the Switch 2 version holds up, the <a href="https://youtu.be/V5Ai1Zg4jGU?t=21">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has released a side-by-side graphics and performance comparison, showing it alongside the original Switch release.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition runs at 4K at 60fps docked, and there's also a 120fps option - lowering the game's resolution to 1080p. As for the handheld mode, players can expect a bump from 720p on Switch to 1080p on the Switch 2, with the game running at 120fps. You can see it all in motion in the video above.</p>
<p>The game's frame rate on the Switch 2 is mostly consistent when it comes to reaching its target frames, even on the higher 120fps setting. As we've already noted, this is a free upgrade if you already own the Switch version of the title. You can access this download from the eShop.</p>
<p>And if you don't own Hollow Knight on either of these platforms, it will set you back $15.00 / £10.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/chrono-trigger-xenogears-writer-is-releasing-a-brand-new-rpg-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1427554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment during today's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>, you may have caught a glimpse at a cute-looking RPG called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/another-eden-begins">Another Eden Begins</a>. Coming to Switch 2 and Switch 1 this <strong>summer</strong>, it features time travel, turn-based combat, ten different endings, and New Game+.</p>
<p>What if we also told you that the creator was none other than Masato Kato, one of the writers of acclaimed '90s Squaresoft RPGs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/xenogears">Xenogears</a>, as well as the director of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross</a>? And that the game's music is composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who <em>also</em> worked on all three of those games? The pieces are starting to fall into place now.</p>
<p>Yep, while it may have been a footnote during the Direct, this sounds like a big one for classic RPG fans. Plus, while it's not immediately clear from the trailer, this is almost-definitely a reworking of Kato's free-to-play mobile RPG <strong><a href="https://en.another-eden.jp/">Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space</a></strong>, which came out in 2017 and is still ongoing.</p>

<p>Fans online seem to think so, highlighting that Begins appears to only cover the first "arc" of the mobile game, while highlighting some of the differences, including a few character redesigns.</p>
<p>Taking place across multiple timelines, Aldo's younger sister is kidnapped by the Beast King. Forced to pursue them, the young hero finds himself falling through spacetime, where he awakens 800 years in the future.</p>
<p>As Aldo, you'll gather 18 different companions, including an android, a feisty hunter, and a noble frog samurai. Look, <em>you're</em> thinking it, not us (Okay, maybe us too) to help traverse the timelines and save the world. Blend in some strategic turn-based combat and you have a JRPG that feels ripped right out of the SNES and PSOne era.</p>

<p>So, this seems to be following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> formula of reworking a mobile favourite to remove the gacha elements <em>and</em> make it fit on home consoles. We'll have to wait for more details, but for now, this looks promising.</p>
