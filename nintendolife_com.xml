<p>Annapurna Interactive has today announced that Furcula's weird roguelike-meets-creature collector <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> will be landing on Switch on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>
<p>This one briefly popped up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-august-2024-every-announcement-and-game-reveal-from-the-indie-world-and-partner-showcases">August 2024 Indie World</a> showcase, where it was accompanied by a 'February 2025' release date. That wasn't meant to be (obviously), but it's nice to hear that it's still coming our way.</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of Morsels before, this is a strange, top-down roguelite where you play as a mouse who is transformed into a Morsel — a weird little creature that possesses wicked combat powers — and sets out into the upper world to take down the oppressive forces of... street cats? Hey, we said it was weird.</p>
<p>In your trips up top, you'll be collecting other Morsels, which can be swapped out as you play to tackle feline foes with different abilities. They're weird-looking fellas, but the retro aesthetic gives a cute sheen to the whole thing.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the Morsels <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fight enemies using your rotating roster of captured Morsels, switching between them at any time<br>
- Each Morsel has its own abilities and strengths, and can become afflicted with ailments or boosted with power-ups and quirks<br>
- Multiple hidden bonus levels with unique art styles and surprising gameplay twists<br>
- Charming and addictive gameplay, with endless replayability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have enough roguelikes on Switch to last us a lifetime, but we'd be lying if we said that the weirdness of this one didn't leave us a little intrigued. Hey, in a few months, we can see it for ourselves.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Will you be checking it out on Switch later this year? Dive into the comments and let us know.</em></p></section>
