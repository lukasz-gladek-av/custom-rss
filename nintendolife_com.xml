<p>You better boo-lieve it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're after something spooky to play in the run up to Halloween this year, then you might want to consider <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/an_english_haunting">An English Haunting</a> from developer Postmodern Adventures.</p>
<p>Available via the Switch eShop now, this is a classic point-and-click adventure with retro-inspired visuals and a dark, spooky atmosphere. It kinda reminds us of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective">The Darkside Detective</a>, which was an excellent entry to the genre back in 2017.</p>
<p>You've got touchscreen support with this one in handheld mode, but for those who prefer docked, you can also connect a USB mouse for proper PC-like controls. As for the story, An English Haunting sees you step into the shoes of Professor Patrick More, who "teams up with a deceptive medium to create an extraordinary device that can reveal what lies beyond our world".</p>
<p>In short, it sounds like a delightfully traditional horror story, and we're here for it. Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Point &amp; click adventure gameplay based on inventory puzzles.</p>
<p>- More than 60 detailed pixel art backgrounds to explore.</p>
<p>- A cast of more than 70 characters to interact with, including real figures from the period, such as the medium Florence Cook, physicist William Crookes, illusionist Harry Houdini, and even writer Arthur Conan Doyle, whom you will control to solve one of the game’s mysteries.</p>
<p>- Inspired by the works of the greatest horror authors from the beginning of the 20th century, M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood, and Arthur Machen.</p>
<p>- Text available in English or Spanish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Squirrelled away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Maximum Entertainment popped up at the Fall IGN Fan Fest to reveal that the delightfully weird sandbox shooter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a>, will be blasting onto Switch 2 on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if you didn't catch this one on its PC release last year, the title tells you just about everything you need to know. You play as a squirrel. You have a gun. What you do with it is up to you.</p>
<p>There's a fair emphasis on the 'sandbox' elements here, with platforming, collectibles, weird little challenges and a bunch of funky gun abilities at your disposal. And let's not beat about the bush, the titular conceit paints a funny enough image on its own.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the official <a href="https://squirrelwithagun.com/">Squirrel with a Gun website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fight Tooth, Claw, and Gun</strong><br>
Discover what an erratic squirrel is capable of with a gun in its paws (or just its paws) and how far how far this fuzzy fiend will go to collect its acorns. Escape a secret underground facility and defeat the Agents. Upgrade your weapons and locate the other secret bunkers to take down elite bosses; even blow up a tank! Swap out weapons to try your paw at all 12 types of enemy takedowns.<br>
<strong><br>
Solve Intricate Puzzle Rooms to Collect Golden Acorns</strong><br>
Navigate unique puzzle challenges to collect all the golden acorns by getting creative with how you use your arsenal of weapons, using weapon recoil to give yourself a boost. Collect enough golden acorns to unlock hidden sections of the game.<br>
<strong><br>
Have Some Nutty Sandbox Fun</strong><br>
Explore the world from a squirrel's eye view or cruise around in your toy car. Harass the neighborhood or ask for nice pets from curious passersby. Help them out in exchange for goodies (or simply mug them) and unlock cosmetics to create your squirrely style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who stick around right to the very end of the above Switch 2 announcement trailer will see Maximum Entertainment and Dee Dee Creations showcase a Squirrel with a Gun <em>physical edition</em> too. We don't have any information on when we can expect to see this boxed copy just yet, but it's always exciting news — heck, the mock-up doesn't even have the Game-Key Card icon on it!</p>
