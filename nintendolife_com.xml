<p>Fair dinkum</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/watch-nintendo-direct-september-2025-live">today's Nintendo Direct</a>, publisher Krafton is bringing developer James Bendon's <strong>Dinkum</strong> to Switch on <strong>9th November</strong>. There's a demo coming on the Switch eShop later today.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of it (or if the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-life-sims-and-farming-games">enormous crop of cosy farm-sim-style games</a> has you confused - which would be understandable!), Dinkum is set on an Australian outback-style island and sees you farming, building, foraging, hunting sharks — you know, all the usual cosy life-sim shenanigans — as you fight to thrive in cute, slightly polygonal environments filled with plant and animal life.</p>
<p>It opened in Early Access back in 2022 on Steam, getting its full release in April this year and garnering over 14,000 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062520/Dinkum/">"Very Positive" reviews</a>. Solo dev Bendon says the game — which is being ported to Switch by 5minlab — has "been the most requested console from players who have been waiting a long time to play Dinkum."</p>
<p>Beyond an "exclusive in-game Battlegrounds costume," content will be available across both PC and Switch, although the update timings may vary per platform.</p>

<p>The game's already sold more than 1.4 million PC copies, apparently, so its Aussie-flavoured offering of 25-minute days, island customisation, and cosy-sim online multiplayer must be doing something right.</p>
<p>The bar is high on Switch when it comes to island customisation and cosy-sim online multiplayer, though, with the spectre of the massively popular <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> lingering on years after its pandemic-fuelled world takeover. Whether Dinkum can compete is a question for which we'll have to wait until November for an answer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, check out the trailer at the top of the page if any of this sounds up your street.</p></section></article><div><p>Gavin first wrote for Nintendo Life in 2018 before joining the site full-time the following year, rising through the ranks to become Editor.

<p>What's not to LOVE?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> will launch for Nintendo Switch 2 on 12th February 2026.</p>
<p>The game, which you can check out in the trailer above, looks like it's taking Mario Tennis back to its glory days, packed full of features, modes, and even an adventure for the cute characters involved to work through!</p>
<p>We'll have more info on this one as it comes in, but a new tennis game from the Mushroom kingdom is always a good time, and with brand new Fever Racket mechanics, a roster of 38 (!) characters, tournament and trial modes, motion controls and online play...we're fairly excited already!</p>

<p>Available for Switch 1 &amp; Switch 2!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> digital pre-orders are now live on the Nintendo eShop for both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0, as you'll doubtless be aware, takes the series back in time for a new story that features a fully-customisable protagonist, larger party sizes, town-building and, of course, the good old turned-based scraps and high drama we all show up for in the first place.</p>
<p>The game is available in both standard and deluxe editions on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/OCTOPATH-TRAVELER-0-2914713.html#Overview">eShop</a>, with the standard coming in at £49.99/$49.99 whilst that fancier version will set you back £54.99/$59.99 (or whatever that equates to where you are). The digital deluxe version nets you the game and the following extras for your coin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>■ Contents of the Digital Deluxe Version</p>
<p>1. OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 Base Game<br>
2. Deluxe Travel Provisions</p>
<p>▼ Action Skills<br>
- Triple Strike Mastery<br>
- SP Saver Mastery<br>
- Extra JP Mastery</p>
<p>▼ Consumable Items: 8 Types of Nuts (M)<br>
- Fortifying Nut (M)<br>
- Magic Nut (M)<br>
- Tough Nut (M)<br>
- Resistant Nut (M)<br>
- Light Nut (M)<br>
- Critical Nut (M)<br>
- Sharp Nut (M)<br>
- Slippery Nut (M)</p>
<p>▼ Town Decorations: Festive Decoration Designs<br>
- Table with Roasted Chicken<br>
- Festive Arch<br>
- Large Festive Arch<br>
- Festive Flag<br>
- Grand Vase</p>
<p>3. Digital Art Book</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/OCTOPATH-TRAVELER-0-2914713.html#Overview">game's eShop page</a>, there's also confirmation that Switch 1 and Switch 2 save info is transferable, so that's great news! However, it also confirms that there's no upgrade path available between both versions.</p>
<p>On Switch, Octopath Traveler 0, as noted over on the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">game's official website</a>, will run at 720p and up to 30fps, whilst Switch 2 players get 1080p/60fps. So, make sure you get the version you know you're gonna stick with.</p>
<p>Here's a selection of images from the eShop page to compare and contrast Switch 1 and 2. It's not too hard to see the drop in resolution, but otherwise both versions are looking tasty!</p>
