<p>Bingo!</p>

<figure data-uuid="72fca9445ef7b"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72fca9445ef7b/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>We had a blast with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> when it arrived on Switch and Switch 2 earlier this summer, but we can all agree that it was missing something, right? Something like, we don't know, bingo?</p>
<p>Well, Marvelous has answered the call and has added exactly that in the new ver. 1.1.0 update. Yes, 'Happy Bingo' is the big addition this time around, giving you the daily chance to fill out an activity card and win a prize. You'll need to have reached 'City Bazaar Rank' or higher to unlock the new mode, but with that out of the way, it's bingo a-go-go.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436xovwrg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's a little more information about the new mode from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2508780/view/499459531596630810">Steam game page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve updated the game and reached “City Bazaar Rank,” the Nature Sprites will visit during an event cut scene introducing “Happy Bingo.” Each spot on the card features an everyday activity like fishing or petting animals. Players complete these activities to fill spots on their card until they’ve completed a Happy Bingo! Players then turn in completed cards at the Nature Sprites’ stall, Happy Shoppe, on bazaar days to earn a variety of useful items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's not just bingo, either. Marvelous has thrown a handful of other fixes and tweaks into this update, all of which were shared in an update post on Steam. We've collected these patch notes together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Ver. 1.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bingo features added<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue resulting in a rare game crash<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where dismounting from horse would reset bag color to default outfit settings<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where pet food bowl would stop functioning properly after rehoming a pet<br></li>
<li>Adjusted select BGM and sound effect volume<br></li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
<li>Addressed Unity security vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>While we had a few small issues with the fishing and sheer number of gameplay systems, we called Grand Bazaar "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 8/10 review</a>. You'll find it in full below.</p>

<p>The Minecraft crew join the Season Pass</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> was released for the Switch at the end of last month, and now in an update, Sega has locked in the first Season Pass DLC release date.</p>
<p>This included a teaser trailer and the confirmation that the paid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Pack is out this week on 8th October 2025. It contains Steve, Alex and Creeper, along with a new track. This is available in the Season Pass and Digital Deluxe Edition, or you can purchase the standalone pack.</p>

<p>This will also be joined by the in-game Minecraft Festival, which will run from 9th October 2025 until 12th October 2025 and is free to join, even if you don't have access to the pack.</p>
<p>This pack will be followed by SpongeBob, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man">Mega Man</a>, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Avatar: Legends.

<p>Legends: Z-A will also be available on the Switch</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>As we've already mentioned, October is a huge month for the Switch 2 (and Switch) with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>So far, there's been some Mega reveals and distribution events announced, and now Nintendo has sunk some of its marketing budget for the game into a commercial featuring the 'Stranger Things' star, Gaten Matarazzo.</p>
<p>The Netflix series is currently in its fifth season, and although there are no links here, Matarazzo is known to be a big fan of Nintendo and has previously teamed up with the company to promote titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this new commercial we get to see the star harness the power of Mega Evolutions, while also highlighting how the Switch 2 is just as playable, when you're out and about, as Nintendo's original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A launches for the Switch 2 and original Switch on 16th October 2025. It's arriving in between an already action-packed month of game releases. The new Pokémon game will also be joined by a new Switch 2 bundle on the same date, which includes a copy of the latest entry.</p>

<p>We're taking baby steps with this one</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="bc74c5000bab3"><a title="Nintendo Life Image" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc74c5000bab3/nintendo-life-image.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday surprised <em>everyone</em> with a new animated short called '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-goes-full-pixar-in-strange-new-animated-short-film-close-to-you">Close To You</a></strong>', and it's already led to all sorts of theories online.</p>
<p>We know Nintendo is currently in the process of expanding beyond video games with theme parks and movies (<em>we're looking at you,</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a>). It's also got its video production company '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/nintendo-launches-official-website-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">Nintendo Pictures</a>' and recently launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">Mario product line in Japan</a> for younger audiences, made up of rattles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">building blocks with amiibo functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Then there's perhaps the most common claim that this new video is tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>. If you watch the short, it appears there's <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1975553503524458919"><em>something</em> invisible</a> moving all the objects in the scene, and Nintendo enthusiasts online have <a href="https://x.com/RogersBase/status/1975703210863304718">seemingly matched up the music</a> in this trailer with the game series.</p>
<p>We've even got <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/53641-nintendo-drops-close-to-you-animated-short-update">past quotes from Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto</a> telling us how Pikmin are "all over our world" and "invisible to the naked eye". So, what do you think? Is this something to do with Pikmin, or do you think it's something completely different? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>That's not all, though.

<p>Oh, and Yacht Club Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> has also been delayed at the last minute, so it will no longer make Halloween.</p>
