<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c34c895667b32/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, announced for Switch 2 back in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct in April, finally has a release date on the newest Nintendo console.</p>
<p>We've known about the game's release date on PC, PS5, and Xbox for a while now, but in a video posted on social media, Randy Pitchford has confirmed that the Switch 2 version will follow shortly afterwards â€” on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Pitchford manages to draw out the reveal in the video posted on X earlier today, but eventually alleviates fans' concerns about the game's portable port.</p>

<p>So, we'll have to wait just an extra three weeks to get our hands on this one. Not bad at all!</p>
<p>Thankfully this was much better news than what has previously been circling Gearbox founder and CEO Pitchford previously. The industry icon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/randy-pitchford-defends-borderlands-4-pricing-comment">was forced to defend a statement</a> he made about game prices where he said "if you're a real fan, you'll find a way", in response to a potential $80 price tag.</p>
