            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer</link>
            <guid>1449868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There's part of me that still can't quite believe I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Rave Racer</a> on a home console. Namco's 1995 sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> never made it out of the arcades back in the day, despite promises that it would be ported to PC as part of NEC's push for its PowerVR graphics processor.</p>
<p>For years, the game's legacy has been having its circuits reproduced in later Ridge Racer games, but Rave Racer has finally been released from its arcade prison – and while its coin-op roots are both a plus and a minus, what we have here is perhaps the purist example of what makes this franchise so special.</p>
<p>Rave Racer consists of four circuits, two of which are taken from the original Ridge Racer (technically, they're variations on the same track, so in reality, there are, in fact, three courses on offer here). The City and Mountain courses would resurface in the PSP entries <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/ridge_racer">Ridge Racer</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/ridge_racer_2">Ridge Racer 2</a></strong> as 'Midtown Expressway' and 'Greenpeak Highlands', while the City circuit would form the basis of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/ridge_racer_6">Ridge Racer 6's</a> Rave City.</p>
<p>You can choose to either race against 11 other cars or take part in Time Trial events, and it's even possible to race all of the circuits in reverse, thanks to a combination of button presses before selecting your track (right, right, then press the accelerator and brake simultaneously).</p>
<p>Manual and Automatic transmission options are available, and this release lets you compete against three other friends in split-screen mode that replicates the multi-cabinet link-up mode originally seen in arcades. There's also a two-player split-screen mode, too.</p>

<p>These features — alongside the traditional Time Attack, Caravan, and Hi Score modes the Arcade Archives series is famous for — do much to extend the longevity of Rave Racer, which, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Arcade Archives Ridge Racer</a> before it, can quickly become stale if you're not totally committed to perfecting your racing lines and tirelessly improving your track times. After all, this is a game that was designed for arcade and not home play.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of progression and low number of circuits on offer, Rave Racer plays like an absolute dream. The handling model in this game is subtly different from that seen in Ridge Racer (and pretty much every other game in the lineage, for that matter); cars aggressively shift as they make sharp turns, and the camera itself tilts whenever you drift around a tight corner. Furthermore, there's an on-screen splitstream gauge that shows when you're benefiting from 'drafting' behind rival cars.</p>
<p>The drifting itself feels like it offers more bandwidth for player skill to emerge; it takes a little getting used to initially (especially for those of us weaned on the PS1 port of Ridge Racer, which was designed with digital and not analogue steering in mind), but after a few hours of play you fall into an almost subconcious 'flow state' and the whole experience becomes practically otherworldly.</p>
<p>Rave Racer isn't the perfect racing game, by any means; there's not a lot of content and no career mode, but the on-track action is as pure and exhilarating as any you'll encounter in the arcade racing sub-genre. And, in case you were wondering, yes, the game still has the bug which has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1RW0MTujA">allowed players to totally smash the game's course records.</a></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="43d9786118aff"><a title="Pokémon 30th Anniversary Box Art Brawl" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43d9786118aff/pokemon-30th-anniversary-box-art-brawl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>'!' Whoops! Looks like you've walked into our path. The exclamation mark has already appeared above our heads. We challenge you to a very special edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Before we send out this week's competitors, however, let's recap what went down <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening">last time</a>. Marking another significant Nintendo anniversary as Zelda turned 40, we matched up two covers for the OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, and after a weekend of voting, the decision was split! Like, 50/50 split. Congrats to both parties, we guess!</p>
<p>But anywho, back to this week's battle. To celebrate 30 wonderful years of Pokémon, we're matching up the generations this time to find out which is the very best (like no one ever was). While we've included the enhanced 'third' editions for each gen where applicable, we've stuck to just the Western mainline games and removed any remakes or Legends inclusions to keep things fair — naturally, some Gens will have more covers than others, but do they add up to a better picture overall?</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsuqmjl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There are the full <em>nine</em> options to choose from this time, so make sure you're stocked up on Potions, and let's get into it.</p>
<h2>Gen I - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red, Blue</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_yellow_version_special_pikachu_edition">Yellow</a></h2>

<p>It doesn't get much more iconic than this, eh? While legendaries would go on to take centre stage on the series' box art, Gen I kicked things off with two of its fully-evolved Starters (Venusaur occupies the 'Green' variant in Japan) and the most well-known 'mon of all, Pikachu.</p>
<p>The backgrounds are as simple as they come, but we love the hand-drawn look of the central figures.</p>
<h2>Gen II - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold, Silver</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_crystal">Crystal</a></h2>

<p>The Gen II legendaries are truly some of the best out there. Lugia, Ho-Oh and Suicune adorn this generation's box art, with shiny backgrounds that really sell a 'step-up' for the series. Talk about a touch of class!</p>
<h2>Gen III - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby, Sapphire</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Emerald</a></h2>

<p>By Gen III, you're no doubt spotting a bit of a theme emerging. It's not enough to take away from the three awesome legendary designs in this generation, mind you (heck, they are this writer's favourites). Another good one, all in all.</p>
<h2>Gen IV - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl">Diamond, Pearl</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_platinum">Platinum</a></h2>

<p>Pokémon really got off to a great start on the DS with this trio. The legendaries look awesome, the dark backdrop suggested there was some drama underneath, and Platinum's glittery sheen is as eye-catching as they come.</p>
<h2>Gen V - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white">Black &amp; White</a> (2)</h2>


<p>The fact that Pokémon White had Zekrom and Black had Reshiram never sat well with this writer, but we just know that dragon-obsessed kids all over the world lost their minds at these covers — and rightly so!</p>
<p>The '2' variants simply dial things up to 11, and there's no arguing with that.</p>
<h2>Gen VI - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X &amp; Y</a></h2>

<p>The series burst into the 3D generation with this pair of covers. The '<em>Look! New legendaries!</em>' format returns from previous games, but we were always particularly fond of the giant 'X' and 'Y' in the backgrounds.</p>
<h2>Gen VII - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon">Sun &amp; Moon</a> (Ultra)</h2>


<p>Our apologies to the Sun and Moon fans out there, but we always found Solgaleo and Lunala to be a little bit... boring. The bright sky backgrounds of each help elevate the covers, it's true, and the Ultra variants spice things up even more (much like Black 2 and White 2 before them). But is it enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the others?</p>
<h2>Gen VIII - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Sword &amp; Shield</a></h2>

<p>New box shape alert! Pokémon covers went portrait in the Switch generation, and how did TPC make use of all that extra space? With two big old legendary dogs, armoured up to the teeth. Fair play.</p>
<h2>Gen IX - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a></h2>

<p>And so we arrive at the latest generation. Say what you will about Gen IX's Koraidon and Miraidon, there's something about the art style here that we find really rather appealing. Perhaps it's the splattered background or the gold trim border, but does anyone else find these unexpectedly... classy?</p>

<p>"There's kind of a part of me that lives on forever"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As you might recall, the All Elite Wrestling star and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> fan Kenny Omega helped out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>'s Year 3 DLC announcement, but it didn't actually end there.</p>
<p>Ahead of the return of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_iii_new_generation">Street Fighter III: New Generation</a> rep Alex this month, Capcom has shared a new video showcasing the pro wrestler's involvement in motion capture for this particular fighter. As part of this, Kenny has also shed some light on the entire process during an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aews-kenny-omega-brings-alex-to-life-for-street-fighter-6-ign-fan-fest-2026">interview with IGN</a>, mentioning how Capcom was very open to his suggestions and also included his signature moves.</p>
<p>In the same interview, he revealed his participation in the motion cap was actually a result of a misunderstanding on his end, and it led to him, fellow pro wrestler Michael Nakazawa, and Capcom hammering out a session in a single day. Here's exactly how it unfolded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the news broke and they told me, we signed the NDAs and we know who the characters are and Alex will, in fact, be one of them. And they said, 'For you being such a good sport, it'd be cool if we put a move of yours in,' maybe one or two or a taunt or something."</p>
<p>"I had said, 'Wow, that would be great. I just don't know when I could fit that into my schedule to do the mocap for it.' And they'd said, 'Oh, wait, you do the mocap for it?' I said, 'Yeah, is that what you were talking about, or no?' They said, 'Oh my, if you would do the mocap for it, that would be awesome.' And so a misunderstanding on my part is what led to me actually going to the studio and doing a slew of mocap for the character. If there was ever a better time to be stupid, that was one of them, because it worked out in my favor completely to not understand what they were talking about at that moment. So because of that one discussion, I got invited back to the next year's Tokyo Game Show. And then before doing the game show, I stopped over at Osaka, where they do the mocap for Capcom. And we hammered it out in one day. It was a grueling 10- or 11-hour shoot. I remember losing like 8 or 9 pounds of water weight, but it was so worth it and so fun."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alex will be followed by the DLC character Ingrid later this year. You can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/61agyx2rvmg">full video interview with Kenny Omega</a> on YouTube. Capcom has also announced it's got JAM Project on board to contribute to the original BGM track "Go! Alex! Hope is Born! - Alex's theme".</p>

<p>"It's Meat Boy like never before"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've played any of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a> games previously, you might be interested to hear a brand-new 3D game is arriving in 2026.</p>
<p>In an update this week, developer Sluggerfly and the game's publisher Headup have now confirmed a Switch 2 version. While <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-meat-boy-3d">Super Meat Boy 3D</a></strong> does approach the brutal platforming action from a different perspective, the core gameplay remains intact.</p>
<p>This includes "brutal, but fair levels", boss fights, Dark World levels, and a soundtrack with involvement from Steve Marcois of the deathcore band Despised Icon. Here's a bit more about this meaty new experience, and you can see some extended gameplay footage on Switch 2 in the video below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em> is a brutal platformer that sees you guide a cube of meat on a mission to rescue his bandage-made girlfriend from an evil fetus in a tuxedo jar - IN 3D! You'll wall-jump past buzz saws, crumbling caves, and flaming forests, dying a million times along the way - IN (you guessed it) 3D. With old-school difficulty, twitchy reflexes, epic bosses, and loads of secrets, it’s Meat Boy like never before - IN (say it with me!) 3D!"</p>

<p>As part of the 30th anniversary Pokémon celebrations, Game Freak this week lifted the lid on its new mainline game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>.</p>
<p>This game is coming exclusively to the Switch 2 in 2027 and includes a new open world to explore as well as "beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves". Of course, there are also new Pokémon to meet, catch and train along the way.</p>
<p>Alongside the reveal trailer, Nintendo's official game pages for this title have also shared some direct screenshots of the game. So here's a sample of what you can expect when this new generation of games arrives at some point next year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsuqmjl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
