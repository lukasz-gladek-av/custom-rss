<p>Another smashing patch</p>

<figure data-uuid="6da3549b449be"><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6da3549b449be/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s first DLC in-game event next week, Nintendo has rolled out a new update for the smash outing.</p>
<p>This updates the game to Version 2.0.2 and includes a fix tied to Pauline's voice when collecting fossils in the two previous updates. It also makes "several other changes" to improve the gameplay experience. If we hear anything else about this update going on behind the scenes, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza: Ver. 2.0.2 (Released October 21, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed the issue causing Pauline's voice not to play at times when acquiring a fossil in Ver. 2.0.0 and Ver. 2.0.1.</p>
<p>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The next in-game event will allow you to nab two new figures for DK Island. Of course, to access this content, you will need to have purchased the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> DLC. If you're still not sure about it, you can check out our review. Here's a quick sample, and below this is the video review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush feels like a split banana. The new roguelike mode is a lot of fun, gelling surprisingly well with the game's core mechanics and giving me a welcome excuse to swing back into my beloved Bananza, but the other half of the deal, DK Island, left me feeling a little short-changed with its lack of appeal outside of the new game mode."</p>

<p>Horrifyingly good news for Luigi fans</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch 2's 'Nintendo Classics' GameCube library for Switch Online expands next week with the return of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>This spooky GameCube launch title will drop on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>, so just in time for Halloween. It made its debut in 2001 and puts Luigi in the spotlight as the main character. After winning a mansion filled with ghosts, he's now got to save the day with the help of Professor E. Gadd and his trusty Poltergust 3000.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer (which highlights how you can now play all three titles on the Switch 2) and here's the official PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luigi wins a stately mansion, but he’s in for a ghastly surprise when he creeps through its front door and learns that his magnificent manor is teeming with ghosts. And worse yet, Mario is nowhere to be found!</p>
<p>Enter <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, where a gallery of ghouls haunt the halls, secrets wait to be unearthed, and Luigi is … not the most courageous character around. Luckily, Professor E. Gadd is on the scene, and he has the perfect tools for the occasion! Play as Luigi, capture ghosts with the Poltergust 3000, track his items and whereabouts with the Game Boy<sup>™</sup> Horror device, and help save Mario from a frightening fate in this action-adventure game originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2001.</p>
<p>With <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> joining Nintendo Classics, all three games in the series can now be played on Nintendo Switch 2, including <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>. Take all three adventures for a spooky spin this Halloween!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This next update follows games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. This is also one of ten titles originally announced alongside the Nintendo Classics GameCube library. Some other titles planned for the service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind, to play Switch Online GameCube games, you need access to a Switch 2 and the Expansion Pack Tier. Japan will receive the same update next week. Apart from Luigi's Mansion, earlier this month, Nintendo also added three more games to the SNES library.</p>
