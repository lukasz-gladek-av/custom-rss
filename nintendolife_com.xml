<figure data-uuid="a4f604de646d6"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4f604de646d6/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>In the magazine business, the back page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else.

<p><em>Today, Jim and Alana are heading off to Kalos for Lumiose City Fashion Week...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>What's the best part about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>? The battle system? The catching? The Wild Zones? The Z-A Royale? No. All of those are factually incorrect answers. The best thing about Pokémon Legends: Z-A is buying clothes. Lots and lots of clothes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59qmisnl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>I'll hear no other opinions on the matter. Z-A is far from the character customisation of a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate</a> or a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout</a>, but who needs 14 types of nose, forehead shapes, and muscle builds when you could have berets, wide-leg pants, and a frilly little satchel?</p>
<p>I've put more time into my outfit choices than I care to admit, and I know for a fact that fellow fashionista Alana has done the same. So join us as we celebrate Lumiose Fashion Week (an event we made up to distract from the Poké Dollars we've spent on shoes) by styling out some of our favourite fits.</p>
<h2>The 'Official' Lumiose City Fashion Show</h2>
<figure data-uuid="de097e1fa51c5"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de097e1fa51c5/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-woman-taking-photo-of-a-woman-in-silver-dress-7778884/">Nintendo Life / Ron Lach / Pexels</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, it's not 'official', nor is it a 'fashion show', but we've each been rifling through our virtual wardrobes to pick out the very best 'fits we can muster.</p>
<p>And of course we've based our looks on our beloved teams — what do you think we are? Rookies?</p>
<h3>Norman's Lumiose looks</h3>
<p>I never normally make myself in a Pokémon game. I almost always pick a different gender and name from my own and see the game through a <em>character's</em> eyes instead.</p>
<p>The exception is when the Pokémon game in question offers a bunch of outfits that I'd very much like to add to my real-life wardrobe. Then, Trainer Jim needs to have a shaggy bob, he needs to wear glasses, and he needs to slay every. single. look.</p>
<p>And so we arrive at my Lumiose collection. Not so much an attempt to directly imitate my Pokémon as it is to match their vibes. If those static NPCs could turn their heads when I walk down the street in my little Gengar number, they would. If they could move their eyes, I'd catch them with my vibrant Feraligatr get-up.</p>
<p>It's new. It's fresh. It's <a href="https://youtu.be/mIydlgER51o?si=RsIJD2nH-Bf1tbfA&amp;t=53">fashion</a>.</p>
<h4>Feraligatr Fit</h4>
<figure data-uuid="f57dc514a4f5d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f57dc514a4f5d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My beloved, vibrant boi needed a big, bold fit to match. Once you see that cream stripe as a little exposed belly sticking out from under a crop top, there's no going back. As for the trousers, well, they're the best money can buy in Lumiose and I won't hear otherwise.</p>
<h4>Absol-utely Fabulous</h4>
<figure data-uuid="6507534c4b6ef"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6507534c4b6ef/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Absol is high-end and edgy, so my fit is too. A white leather jacket and turtleneck are a bold pairing with some chino shorts, but those space boots tie everything together.</p>
<h4>Venusaur 'Venturing</h4>
<figure data-uuid="db4a98a33cff7"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db4a98a33cff7/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What is Venusaur if not a streetwear hiker's dream? The cargos, thicc trainers, and cap are all about presenting a hip exterior, while the fluffy jumper ups the cuddle-factor.</p>
<h4>Gengar Get-Up</h4>
<figure data-uuid="df0d3a87bfd9d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df0d3a87bfd9d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted the Gengar fit to feel like it was floating, hence the vaguely camo bottoms and floral boots. It's a blessing that I don't own one of these beanies in real life. You'd never see me without it.</p>
<h4>Cosy Camerupt</h4>
<figure data-uuid="7d6eee166ee96"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d6eee166ee96/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sure, Camerupt might have a tough exterior (just look at that scowl!), but there's something about him that just feels cosy — hence the comfy cardigan and wide-leg jeans. I'm colour matching a little, but this one's all about the vibes.</p>
<h4>Ooh La La, Gardevoir</h4>
<figure data-uuid="978af0e90dfb1"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/978af0e90dfb1/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Call off the stylists, I've found my favourite fit! The whites are classy, chic, and clean. There's a subtle floral undertone in the loafers, on my beret and in the earrings. Don't even get me started on that hip pop!</p>
<p>If you see this pair heading for you in the mall, you'd better know your azures from your ceruleans.</p>
<h3>Hagues' Kalos kit</h3>
<p>Okay, first off, let's address the Copperajah in the room — I do not have long blue hair in real life. But this trainer also isn't me. This is Kisa, an avatar character I've been using for quite a while. She's my Warrior of Light in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and, as a result, I've grown quite attached to her and sometimes let her jump ship into other games.</p>
<p>Anyone who's played FFXIV knows that 'glamour is the true end-game', so you <em>know</em> we've got some fashion chops here.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm usually a <em>little</em> more girly with my looks, but my team is a mix of ethereal, dopey, and cool. How do you make that work? Well...</p>
<h4>Florges' Fall Florals</h4>
<figure data-uuid="dcc14a95a5e2d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcc14a95a5e2d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>I know</em> I went florals for Florges... but only a little. I can't not. (I'm sorry, Miranda.)</p>
<p>But I didn't go <em>full</em> floral, I went Fall floral. I knew I had to fit the grey morning of Lumiose a little, so a cute little sweater and some sneakers rounded things out.</p>
<h4>Eclectic Eelektross</h4>
<figure data-uuid="eab7bcf9105b2"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eab7bcf9105b2/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the more difficult looks to assemble, Eelektross' colour scheme is gorgeous, but there aren't many easy matches here. The headphones were a must, as was yellow, but I can't match Canari's drip that well.</p>
<h4>Trendy Tyrantrum</h4>
<figure data-uuid="8fea7c3bed3d1"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8fea7c3bed3d1/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chic fossil hunter was my goal here, but Tyrantrum isn't exactly going to pair with an art deco jumpsuit. A boilersuit with a headband, though? Now that's a little bit cute.</p>
<h4>Hawlucha's a Hipster</h4>
<figure data-uuid="2a70dc4907199"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a70dc4907199/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am not a sportswear person, so I was most worried about pairing Kisa up with Hawlucha. Luckily, bright colours are kinda a lucha libre thing, therefore a Hawlucha thing. I can do brights; <em>that's</em> my thing.</p>
<h4>Chandelure Chic</h4>
<figure data-uuid="e6b4b7d49d1ba"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6b4b7d49d1ba/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ghost Pokémon are a gift for fashion, but there are so many obvious routes you could go down. Ultimately, Chandelure screams class to me, so an expensive suit and the hotel interior mean this was the easiest outfit to put together. Just save those Poké Dollars...</p>
<h4>Feraligatr feels Mega Fetching</h4>
<figure data-uuid="91a19b699ec30"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91a19b699ec30/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Totodile line has never been fierce to me — it's always been a goofy line that <em>tries</em> to be fierce. And I love that the Mega evolution for Feraligatr leans into that.</p>
<p>I adore Jim's vibrant red and blue look, but I went a little more classic sailor. Very French.</p>

<p>Spooky season has passed and many of us are now looking ahead to the 'H' season (or perhaps there's some Turkey in the near future for you for those of you in the US). So it's time to load up on the best games you can get on the eShop for the chilly months ahead.</p>
<p>Just in case you need reminding, here are the rules: Our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from last month (that's October 2025) from our suite of reviews. The three games with the highest scores will make the podium. It's that simple!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vugxmt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>It's been a crazy busy month what with Pokémon and tons of Switch 2 ports and indie releases, though that feels like every month at the moment, doesn't it? Every eShop game we scored a 7/10 or above is eligible here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a big one missing — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</a>. We're working on our full review and it'll be with you soon, but until then, make sure you check out <a href="https://youtu.be/zik-Cx7oxQE?si=70EZwzHIvWj1mkfB">Felix's video on the Switch 2 release</a>.</p>
<p>Alrighty then, here are all the games that didn't <em>quite</em> make the cut for the top three; plenty of fantastic games, but the cream of the crop was <em>very</em> good this time around:</p>

<p>When Dotemu speaks, we listen. And we've been particularly excited about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, a brand new IP from the French studio that made its name on Streets of Rage 4 and Windjammers 2. Developed alongside Guard Crush Games and Supamonks, this is a roguelike beat 'em up with tons of style and customisation.</p>
<p>Besides looking <em>beautiful</em>, Absolum is all about finding the build that fits your play and combo style. You can play as one of four characters either alone or in two-player co-op and go through run after run as you try to save the world.</p>
<p>It's fiendishly good, and on Switch 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/absolum">we scored it a 9/10</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: Absolum did receive a physical launch just a few weeks after its release, but we've allowed it to remain part of the votes this month.</em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">2nd Place - Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>It may not be Metroid Prime Pinball, but hey, we don't <em>need</em> Samus when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a> is loaded up. A bullet hell pinball follow up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon's Tilt</a>? Cyberpunk imagery, a huge table, 9 balls? You'll never need another pinball table again.</p>
<p>You have a three-story pinball table to conquer, and it'll take you a good while to get your head around everything you can do in-game. But that Genesis-style soundtrack and those neon visuals will be more than enough to tempt you back for one more go.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action">another 9/10 for us</a> on the Switch 1. Heck of a game, that.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Ball x Pit  (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a> is impossible to get away from right now. If you're a fan of roguelikes, Breakout, or Vampire Survivors, then you've probably already poured hours into this thing. It's <em>the</em> hot thing this October, and it's no surprise it won our staff's eShop Selects vote.</p>
<p>This mishmash of things, which includes base-building, multiple playable characters, tons of ball combinations (no giggling in the back, there), and waves and waves of enemies to stop you on each of your runs, is a cacophony of numbers, colours, and euphoria. Once you nail the formula with one character, you'll want to do it with them all. Keep aiming, bouncing, and combining, and you'll get there soon enough.</p>
<p>Rounding out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ball-x-pit">9/10s this month</a>, congrats to Ball x Pit for completely surprising us and taking away all of our free time! Oh! And a Switch 2 version dropped just last week, so go try it for yourself.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-october-2025]]></content:encoded>
