<p>Catching Zs</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has revealed yet another new Mega 'mon arriving in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC, but more than that, it has revealed a whole new <em>type</em> of Mega Evolution.</p>
<p>Mega Lucario Z is the latest Fighting- and Steel-type Mega Evolution to join the line-up, boasting a swanky blue and yellow look as well as some particularly fetching fringe work. This marks the debut appearance of Z Mega Evolution — a new take on the mechanic that sees Pokémon able to fire off their moves quicker, but also burn through their Mega Power at a faster rate.</p>
<p>Pokémon that undergo a Z Mega Evolution might not be best suited for long battles, then, but they'll likely pose a good way for wrapping up fights with a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Here's the official rundown of Mega Lucario Z and a handful of snaps from The Pokémon Company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility. It can utilize its aura in a variety of ways, including stretching it into a shield or channeling it into physical blows by concentrating it into specific parts of its body, such as its legs or fists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mega Lucario Z will arrive with the <em>other</em> new Megas in the Legends: Z-A DLC on 10th December.</p>

<p>The path to Mega Mewtwo starts here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As a part of today's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC news, The Pokémon Company revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legends: Z-A</a>'s next Mystery Gift Code event, and it's not one to be missed.</p>
<p>The event is live in-game right now. All that you need to do is head to the 'Mystery Gift' menu and select 'Receive via Internet' to get involved. Right off the bat, you'll be rewarded with special Mewtwonite X &amp; Y Mega Stones, and you'll also unlock the new 'Project M' side mission, which sets you on the path to catch — you guessed it — Mewtwo!</p>
<p>You need to have rolled credits to access the gift, but no end date has been revealed for the event at the time of writing, so you've got plenty of time to get there if you're still exploring Lumiose at your leisure.</p>
<p>And yes, while the news was broken in today's Mega Dimension dump, the event is available for <em>everyone with the base game</em>.</p>
