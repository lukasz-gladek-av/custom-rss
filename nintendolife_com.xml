<blockquote>
<p>"Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership takes this long-running RPG series to new heights in a high-seas adventure that's packed full of top-notch combat, inventive variety, a positive and thoughtful story, and lots signature comedy from the dynamic duo themselves. This is a big game, packed full of surprises and fun, and the all-new Battle Plug system, alongside lots of flashy specials, a fittingly emotive art-style, and a world that brimming with puzzles and challenges, make for a must-play in our book."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>The digital version launched last month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the digital release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> at the end of last year, Sega has now locked in the launch date for the physical version.</p>
<p>It previously revealed it would be arriving in "early 2026" and it's now been confirmed this release will be racing onto Switch 2 on <strong>26th March 2026</strong>. It will be priced at <strong>$69.99 USD</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>) and Sega notes how it will feature the "full base game" on the cartridge.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to simply upgrade your existing Switch copy, you can purchase the game's upgrade for <strong>$10.00</strong>.</p>
<p>As one extra treat today, Sega has also announced the "Blue Star Extreme Gear" is now available to all CrossWorlds players. This follows on from last week's release of the paid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a> Pack for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, allowing players to race as Pac-Man and Team Ghost on a track inspired by the series.</p>

<p>Airing later this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches next month on the Switch 2, and as we get closer to this anticipated release, Capcom has announced it will be airing a Resident Evil Showcase this week on <strong>15th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It promises to feature "brand new gameplay and news" about the upcoming entry starring Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. Of course, if there are any other surprises revealed, we'll be sure to let you know when the news drops.</p>
<p>Capcom also notes how it will feature a "post-show" discussion on the <a href="https://youtu.be/VXQveAdzC74">Capcom USA YouTube channel</a> after the main showcase, featuring Twitch partner guests and a giveaway of a Resident Evil 4 Collector's Edition. It's worth noting there will be "no new information" during this segment.</p>
<p>This announcement follows a short trailer for Resident Evil Requiem surfacing at CES 2026 last week (it was actually featured during NVIDIA'S PC showcase of the title). Apart from Requiem, Capcom previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a> will also be heading to the Switch 2 on 27th February 2026.</p>
<p>To start the new year off, Capcom is currently offering some deals on the Nintendo eShop in select locations - with sales on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_investigations_collection">Ace Attorney</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man</a> and more.</p>
