<figure><a title="madden big patch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c10fce3ee4b2e/madden-big-patch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>EA Sports has dropped a huge new update for the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a>. The September 17th patch introduces a large number of fixes, adjustments, and other bits and bobs to a game that does a very solid job of bringing the full Madden experience to handheld - so long as you can take the frame rate hit.</p>
<p>Focusing in on highlights here, this patch (which brings the game to version 1.7) brings defensive adjustments in the midfield that should make runners a little easier to catch, whilst a new mechanic that's been brought over from EA's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_26">College Football</a> franchise allows you to make your own default pass protection system to suit your chosen coach philosophy. Audio and visual effects, some quirky animations and other bugs also see fixes.</p>
<p>You can check out the full, and very long, patch notes over at <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-september-17-2025">EA's site</a>, but here are some highlights for your perusal:</p>

<hr>
<p>Indeed, a glance over to the game's forums in the wake of the news of this update, and players seem very happy with the laundry list of changes in the patch notes, most of which have been in response to feedback. So well played there, EA.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">8/10 review</a>, we said Madden NFL 26 is "a very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory. Yes, you'll need to get used to a drop in the frame rate to 40fps on Switch 2, but it's a reasonable downgrade in order to get this type of game running as well as it does on a portable machine."</p>

<p>Cuts quite the figure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/curse_of_the_dead_gods">Curse of the Dead Gods</a> is an excellent roguelike in the now-classical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> vein, one that earned itself a lovely 8/10 from us back when it released, and Passtech Games' follow-up to that cracker, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ravenswatch">Ravenswatch</a>, is also quite the banger itself, sitting pretty as it currently is on a very nice score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ravenswatch/">84 on Metacritic</a>.</p>
<p>Think Hades but with heroes, villains and settings plucked from twisted versions of the fairytales of your youth, and you're pretty much there. It's a goodie from a team with a good track record, in short, and today it's getting a free update called Hourglass of Dreams.</p>
<p>Here are some quick details from the press blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In</em> <em>Ravenswatch</em><em>, there is a constant intangible threat: time management. Defenders of the world of Reverie have 3 days and 3 nights (18 minutes) per level before the Master Nightmare awakens. The Hourglass of Dreams update has a significant impact on each run, as it allows players to earn additional rewards by completing a level ahead of schedule. The faster the heroes challenge and defeat the Master Nightmare, the greater the rewards.</em></p>
<p><em>Conversely, they can now decide to take their time to explore the level further and try to strengthen themselves as much as possible, up to 3 minutes after the Master Nightmare awakens. But this additional time comes at a heavy price: depending on its duration, the boss becomes increasingly formidable, with exponentially increased damage and health points!"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The free update also includes character rebalances, more environments, new side activities and quests, with something called the Leprechaun's Cauldron, a Jack and the Beanstalk challenge and more besides!<em><br></em></p>

<figure><a title="Xenoblade / Days of our Lives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0dcf8f1da785/xenoblade-days-of-our-lives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The long-running American soap opera <strong>Days of Our Lives</strong> has made headlines recently after one of its regular characters name-dropped <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong>, of all things.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407">Nintendeal</a> on X (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-cant-believe-a-days-of-our-lives-character-just-name-dropped-a-mid-tier-rpg-franchise-while-flirting">IGN</a>), the moment occurred when Aaron Greene attempted to invite Arianna Horton into his room by asking if she wants to "come play Xenoblade on my Switch". Looking like she just couldn't let the poor guy down, Arianna actually agreed and said "wow, uh, yeah, yeah sure".</p>

<p>It's not the first time a Nintendo franchise has been name-dropped in a TV show, and nor will it be the last, but usually it's the likes of Mario or Zelda that are the go-to franchises for something like this.</p>
<p>Here, however, the fact that Xenoblade is name-dropped indicates that the writer of this particular scene may be a fan; or at the very least is aware of the RPG series from developer Monolith Soft.</p>
<p>It's gone down well with fans, regardless, with user <a href="https://x.com/ZhenghuaYang">Zhenghua Yang</a> stating "This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned. Top tier marketing."</p>
