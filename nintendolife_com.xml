<p>Confirmed in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/29/3122984/0/en/Atari-enters-into-an-agreement-to-invest-in-Thunderful-Group-AB.html">press release</a>, Atari will become the majority owner of the company, which was founded in 2017 and was essentially a merger between Image &amp; Form, Zoink, and Rising Star Games. It will acquire around 82% of the outstanding shares at approximately €4.5 million.</p>
<p>The Swedish Securities Council has granted Atari an exception to complete the transaction without needing to bid for the remaining shares.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This news comes just after <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update">Thunderful Group announced</a> that it would be restructuring the company to "improve operative cash flow", as the company is operating at a deficit.</p>
<p>Its most-recent release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random_the_eternal_die">Lost In Random: The Eternal Die</a> — which only launched last month — has "shown weaker sales than expected". CEO Martin Walfisz <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-martin-walfisz-to-leave-the-role-as-ceo-of-thunderful-group-ab">will also be stepping down from his role</a> by the end of the calendar year.</p>

<p>Thunderful went through a restructuring twice in 2024, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/thunderful-announces-its-second-restructuring-program-in-one-year">second as recently as November 2024</a>. Its newest SteamWorld game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_heist_ii">SteamWorld Heist II</a>, reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/new-steamworld-game-sales-fell-slightly-short-of-thunderfuls-expectations">fell slightly short of expectations</a>. Thunderful just announced it was bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> to Switch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/acclaimed-puzzler-viewfinder-bends-reality-on-switch-this-winter">later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Atari has made a number of fruitful acquisitions over the past few years, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/atari-enters-agreement-to-acquire-night-dive-studios">Nightdive Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/atari-acquires-retro-specialist-digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a>. With Thunderful's woes over the past few years, <em>hopefully</em> this will turn out as well as these two seem to have.</p>
