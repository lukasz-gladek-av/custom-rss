<p>To celebrate the milestone, Marvelous has also showcased a new piece of artwork on social media, which depicts the protagonist's loyal partner and guide Woolby wearing a delightful party hat. Adorable.</p>

<p>Released on <strong>5th June 2025</strong> to coincide with the launch of the Switch 2, Guardians of Azuma gained high praise for its mix of RPG and simulation gameplay. We awarded it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">a score of 9/10</a> and said that it "manages to reinvent itself while still maintaining the bones that make the Rune Factory series feel like itself".</p>
<p>At the moment, Guardians of Azuma remains a console exclusive for the Switch and Switch 2, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/australian-classification-rates-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-disgaea-7-complete">Australian classifications</a> indicate that it may soon come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, so that will no doubt boost its sales quite nicely.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hqlkrn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Arriving "This Fall"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Mega Evolution is the talk of the town for Pokémon in 2025, and it looks like it won't be long before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> gets in on the fun too.</p>
<p>As showcased in the weekend's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-2025-pokemon-world-championships-closing-ceremony">Pokémon World Championships Closing Ceremony</a>, the next TCG Pocket expansion will introduce a batch of Mega Evolution cards to the mobile app. While the full lineup is yet to be revealed, we got a peek at the Mega Gyarados ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Altaria ex cards, which we're sure we'll all be chasing when the next expansion arrives at some point "this Fall".</p>
<p>These new Mega Evolved ex cards boast high HP stats and the ability to deal some tasty damage, but they come with their own risks. You see, if your Mega Evolution ex card gets knocked out, your opponent will take <em>three</em> points — in short, it's an insta-win.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how these high-risk, high-reward cards shift the meta when they arrive in the app in the coming months. We still don't have a name or a secure release date just yet, but we're going to start saving our Pack Hourglasses now, just in case.</p>

<p>Launching next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Feardemic has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bad_cheese">Bad Cheese</a>, a new survival horror from developer Simon Lukasik, will launch on the Switch (with backwards compatibility on Switch 2) on <strong>1st September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">Bendy And The Ink Machine</a> before it, Bad Cheese utilises old-school 'rubber hose' animation, which was perhaps most notably used in the 2D action-platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>. It's difficult to gauge exactly what the aim of the game is, but it appears that you'll be navigating a spooky 3D environment, interacting with various objects, and solving tactile puzzles to progress.</p>
<p>We have to admit, it doesn't necessarily look <em>scary</em>, but the atmosphere seems to be fairly effective, and there's definitely some creepy monster designs being utilised throughout the trailer.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Face your demons –</strong> You all live together. You, Dad, Mom, Brother, and the rest of the demons. Try not to cause problems so you don’t have to be punished<br>
<strong><br>
- Help around the house –</strong> Scrub, sweep, clean, make fries, kill spiders, bring Daddy his pills – essentially, be a good kid<br>
<strong><br>
- Find hidden treasures –</strong> Explore the house and look for treats and action figures scattered around. This might be the only fun part about living here<br>
<strong><br>
- Just try to get by –</strong> Visit various parts of the house, face difficult situations, and experience the gruesome reality of a child-mouse trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in an abnormal household</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These battles will allow up to four trainers to join in on battles where they attempt to defeat as many of each other's Pokémon within a set time limit of 3 minutes. You'll need to make full use of a variety of moves as well as Mega Evolutions as you "go on the offensive".</p>
<p>Here's the official PR, and you can check out the latest trailer below this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trainers will be able to jump into the Z-A Battle Club in the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> game in the newly revealed Link and Ranked Battles. In the Z-A Battle Club (Link Battles), up to four players will race to defeat as many Pokémon as possible within the time limit to take the top spot.</p>
<p>In Ranked Battles, up to four Trainers can compete online from around the world to earn points. When players earn enough points, they will rise in rank. Trainers will start off at Rank Z and can be promoted all the way up to the ultimate Rank A.​</p>
<p>Players can earn in-game rewards when a battle ends or when their rank increases, with additional rewards granted based on their final rank when the season ends after a set time period. Since rewards vary by season, active participation is necessary to climb the ranks and earn rewards. Players will also be able to enjoy Private Battles with their friends using local communicationor with those farther away online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A arrives for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>, with pre-orders now officially live. This includes a Nintendo Switch 2 + <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> bundle offer.</p>
