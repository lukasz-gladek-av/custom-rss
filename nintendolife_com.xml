<p>"Plenty of toilet humour"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Art of Play, Boat Rocker Media, and the BBC have announced a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danger_mouse">Danger Mouse</a> game based on the hit cartoon series from the '80s.</p>
<p>Scheduled for launch in <strong>2026</strong>, Danger Mouse will be a side-scrolling affair with 15 levels to work through. Co-op play will be available to include Penfold as a playable character, and the title is said to include "plenty of toilet humour", so we're definitely morbidly intrigued to see what that entails.</p>
<p>There's little else to note at the moment, but from the few screenshots available at the time of writing, the visuals actually look pretty cool; very faithful! We'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one in the coming months.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 15 Levels – Side-scrolling, arcade battle action, super danger-filled levels!<br>
- Team Up – As Danger Mouse and Penfold in cooperative multiplayer to take on the Baron’s evil epic do-overs!<br>
- Take Control – Of the iconic Mark IV to drive, dive, fly, and tap dance your way to victory again…!<br>
- Plenty of Toilet Humor – But no potty mouth. Just incredibly dangerous foes to battle all over the globe!<br>
- Time Wasters – Errr… um… We mean mini games. Yes. Mini games!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a find!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pikachu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b9699422f05d/pikachu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's amazing what you can find in the bottom of a bin sometimes, right? Not that we frequently go scurrying around in trash, you understand... But y'know, there are definitely occasions when something rare and potentially very valuable has been unknowingly thrown away.</p>
<p>Case in point, Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ElbowDeepInElmo/">ElbowDeepInElmo</a> (lovely...) has posted images of a Pikachu statue that they state was rescued from the trash by a printing company responsible for the early runs of Pokémon cards (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pikachu-statue-that-was-salvaged-from-the-trash-turns-out-to-be-official-promotional-material-from-1999-us-premiere-of-pokemon-the-first-movie/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>According to the poster, it's not just any statue, but rather a piece of promotional material that was used for <strong>Pokémon: The First Movie</strong> when the film had its premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in 1999.</p>

<p>The Pikachu is sadly missing its tail, which was likely thrown away at the same time as the main statue itself, but the poster is hoping to have a replacement tail 3D printed to make the statue complete once again.</p>
<p>It's also been made clear that the statue is not currently for sale or trade at the time of writing. We reckon it might be worth quite a bit at this point, mind you, even if it is missing its tail.</p>
<p>You can <em>just about</em> see the statue in the archival footage from the premiere below, which in itself is a wild trip down memory lane, even if you weren't there yourself. Ah, those were the days...</p>

<p><em>What do you make of this extraordinary find? Have you got any rare or interesting Pokémon merchandise or promotional material from back in the day? Let us know with a comment.</em></p></section>

<p>It's showtime in 'Uncaged Fury'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Mortal Kombat II movie hype train is about to leave the station, with Warner Bros. today releasing a teaser tied to the upcoming action movie, which is arriving in cinemas on <strong>24th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's actually an "in-universe film trailer" for 'Uncaged Fury' starring Johnny Cage, who is played by The Boys superstar Karl Urban. Here's the description <a href="https://youtu.be/Sccu5MKUfuA">via IGN</a>. And just a word of warning, there is some swearing and a rude gesture (Johnny flipping the bird) in the video above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Uncaged Fury sees the legendary Johnny Cage take on a band of goons with ease, making use of pipes, fast-paced combat skills, and an aura unlike any other."</p>
</blockquote>
