<p>Hey! Look!</p>

<figure data-uuid="6837cd168aee5"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6837cd168aee5/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has revealed a new batch of photos of the upcoming live-action Zelda movie, giving us our closest look yet at its central duo.</p>
<p>The pictures were shared on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, and reveal Bo Bragason's Princess Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth's Link in full costume on location in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Now, it's true, there are only three photos to take in for now, but it looks... like Zelda! This is the first time that we have seen the lead cast in costume, and the game inspo is certainly strong with each actor's look.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e10c57b60c81c"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e10c57b60c81c/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Movie Link appears to be sporting a darker green tunic and cream undershirt, vaguely reminiscent of his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess">Twilight Princess</a> styling, while Zelda's blue dress and plaits more closely resemble something out of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="367ff37016cd1"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/367ff37016cd1/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now remember, these images have only been shared on Nintendo Today! at the time of writing (where direct capture and screenshots are not available), so these are the best shots we can get for now — but be sure to head over to the app to see them in their full glory.</p>
<p><em>Update. Nintendo has since shared higher-quality images on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434768853606880">Twitter</a>, which we have subbed in above. The <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067">tweet</a> was accompanied by the following message from Miyamoto:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Filming is on track for the film’s release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latest pictures accompany the news that the live-action film has officially started shooting. We'll have to wait until <strong>7th May 2027</strong> to see it in its full glory, but we'd expect to see more updates like this as the run-up continues.</p>
