<p>Still coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><em>Are</em>Fans are still speculating as to what exactly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/danganronpa-2x2">Danganronpa 2x2</a> is — part a remaster and rerelease of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_2_goodbye_despair_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa 2</a>, part a brand new scenario, the game is largely shrouded in mystery. But while we wait for more info (and a firmer 2026 release date), Spike Chunsoft has opened up pre-orders for the physical release of the game.</p>
<p>On both Switch 1 and Switch 2, Danganronpa 2x2 will be getting a standard physical release — stocked at various retailers for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> — which appears to include the game fully on the card for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Plus. there's a special collector's edition, appropriately-named the 'Psycho Tropical Vacation Package'. This will set you back <strong>$139.99 USD</strong> and includes a RSVLTS reversible Psycho Tropical hat, a Kidrobot 3" figure of bother tropical Monokuma and Monomi, an OST which includes remixes of the best tracks from the original game, and a clamshell-style outer box to display your collection in.</p>
<p>In addition, if you pre-order directly from <a href="https://store.spike-chunsoft.com/">Spike Chunsoft</a>'s Shopify page, you'll get a 4" Monokuma Flight Tag.</p>

<p>Canadian store <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/products/danganronpa-2x2-standard-edition-nintendo-switrch-pre-order?bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP</a> has also opened up pre-orders for the game for <strong>$84.99 CAD</strong> (or <strong>$194.99 CAD</strong> for the special edition). European European orders will be handled by Reef Entertainment.</p>
<p>We haven't seen much of Danganronpa 2x2 since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">its reveal at the September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, though it was shown off at the Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Fes: Ultimate Appreciation Festival back in November.</p>
<p>The "all new storyline" being added to this rerelease is reportedly meant to be as long as the base game, which means double the content. And probably double the shenanigans. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_v3_killing_harmony_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa V3</a>, anything is possible...</p>

<p>On <strong>17th February 2026</strong>, owners of the Nintendo Switch versions of both games will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Editions for free. And if you have the newer console, why wouldn't you? The price for the Switch 2 Edition straight-up hasn't been announced.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, you'll be able to play both games and 1440p and 60fps docked, while handheld is bumped to 1080p and 60fps. You all want to see some terrifying sea creatures in crisp, shiny visuals in the dark now, don't you? *shudders*</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wrspgm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Controls have also been "optimized" for Switch 2, so perhaps there's some Mouse Mode integration there?</p>
<p>Both Subnautica games arrived on Switch 1 back in May 2021 and we enjoyed both of them a lot — though the first game <em>just</em> edges out Below Zero for us. If you've never played them before, then make sure you have a read of our reviews, <em>and</em> check out the rundown from the games' eShop page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining the award-winning game Subnautica with its sequel Subnautica Below Zero, this Nintendo Switch™ exclusive allows players to fully immerse themselves in the full mystery surrounding the water world of planet 4546B.</p>
<p>Craft equipment, pilot submarines and out-smart wildlife to explore lush coral reefs, volcanoes, cave systems, and more - all while trying to survive in both hostile water zones and frozen terrain.</p>
<p>Features:<br>
- Survival Is Key: Gather valuable materials, craft tools, manage your hunger and thirst, all while evading the dangerous wildlife that sees you as its next meal<br>
- Crash Landing on Planet 4546B: Beneath the serene waves of this aquatic planet are clues around its complicated history and how it warps the lives for all those that crash land there<br>
- Exploration: Delve into unique aquatic and terrain biomes that will unlock not only materials, but the answers that you seek<br>
- Build Your Habitat: Crafting and building the comforts of home here. These bases will be integral for your survival from not only the wildlife, but also the harsh environment around you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sequel, <strong>Subnautica 2</strong>, is due to come to Early Access 2026, but Switch 2 isn't one of the slated platforms for it.</p>
<p>Plus, the sequel's publisher Krafton (who acquired the dev in 2022) and Unknown Worlds are embroiled in a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">rather messy lawsuit</a>. Krafton has also attracted additional negative attention after it announced it was working on becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">an "AI first" company</a>.</p>
