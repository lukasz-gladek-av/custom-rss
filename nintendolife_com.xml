<p>However, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">with a Metacritic rating of 79 at the time of writing</a>, it's clear that Samus' latest adventure didn't strike the same chord with many players.</p>
<p>It's certainly a different experience from prior Metroid outings, and it seems that Nintendo is willing to chalk this down to its protracted development period – lest we forget, it was originally announced in 2017 with Bandai Namco assisting, but was rebooted in 2019 with Retro Studios returning to the helm.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/" rel="noopener">Famitsu</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson (a name isn't given, it's worth noting) gives the following assessment of Metroid Prime 4's development period (thanks to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-discusses-its-approach-to-metroid-prime-4-and-why-it-isnt-open-world/">Nintendo Everything</a> for the translation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world Metroid’. However, Metroid’s core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas. Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.</p>
<p>In the end, the game took much longer than expected to finish, and we realized that players’ impressions toward open-world games had changed. That being said, development had already been reset once before (when we started again from scratch with Retro Studios) so backtracking development again was out of the question, and we resolved to move forward with our original vision. During this time, shooting games and action games went through evolutions, with an increase in game speed in particular, but taking in those changes would have made it difficult to construct the tempo of an adventure game, so we actively chose to not take them into account. Therefore, I think this game is pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as we (and many other outlets) loved Metroid Prime 4, it's fair to say that Retro Studios wouldn't have chosen to inherit a design template it had little influence or control over, and this surprisingly candid interview appears to back up this assumption.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition</link>
            <guid>1392649</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Switch owners already have access to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear: Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">its sequel</a>, but Bloober Team is back with a new port for Switch 2. Utilising Unreal Engine 5 to achieve some truly impressive visuals, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a> is neither a sequel nor a remake, but rather the definitive vision of the series so far, packaging both titles into one enhanced experience.</p>
<p>The result is mixed. Although this is new for Switch 2, it launched elsewhere in 2023, before the studio significantly upped its game (in my opinion) with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>. As such, what you’re getting here is a perfect representation of what I’d call ‘old’ Bloober; one that focuses on scripted, linear events with minimal player agency.</p>
<p>There’s certainly a place for that, but Layers of Fear feels like the video game equivalent of a haunted house ride. Lots of things happen <em>around</em> you and it’s all very pretty, but rarely does anything actually happen <em>to</em> you. The result is a sense of detachment from the frequent scares, which come so thick and fast that there’s barely any time to soak in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>You've got three main stories here: The Painter from the original game, The Actor from its sequel, and The Writer, a new frame narrative that ties everything together. DLCs old and new can be accessed through The Writer’s story, making this a comprehensive retelling of the series. Each story features some wonderful voice acting, though I do think this has actually been overused. Nearly every note found in the environment (and there are a <em>lot</em>) features an unseen narrator, and it’s just a little excessive – thankfully, muting it entirely is an option.</p>
<p>Gameplay is a case of meandering through detailed environments to pick up documents, letters, and objects that gradually shed light on the overarching narrative. Mysterious sounds puncture the air, furniture moves of its own accord, and corridors that might seem perfectly normal at first glance shift in new directions when you give them a second look. This is pretty cool for the first couple of hours, but the novelty wears off.</p>
<p>Exacerbating this, navigating the world is a little tougher than it needs to be. You open doors by holding ‘ZR’ then pulling forward or back on the right stick. This works fine 90% of the time, but there are moments when it just won’t function as intended, so you’ll need to let go entirely and take a moment to recalibrate what your fingers and thumbs are actually doing. Optional mouse controls alleviate this slightly and feel great for the most part.</p>
<p>And what a handsome game! The lighting is particularly impressive, and it runs well on Switch 2, appearing to aim for 60fps when docked, though the 30fps and excessive motion blur can look a touch jarring in handheld. If you’ve yet to experience the 2016 original or its direct sequel, this is the best way to do so, but if you’re after a really solid horror experience, Cronos is the better option.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition]]></content:encoded>
