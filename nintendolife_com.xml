            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="61ffe6b0cd8e7"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61ffe6b0cd8e7/nintendo-switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the introduction of the OLED model, there's been an Ethernet port built into the dock of Nintendo's flagship Switch, and that continued this year with Switch 2. If you're after the fastest download speeds or you play competitive online games while docked to your TV, you may benefit from wiring up your dock to your router directly.</p>
<p>However, since launch back in June, we've seen reports of players having issues with wired internet connections. Some point to the Realtek port as the culprit, others think it's a specific firmware or software glitch, or a USB-C-related handshake issue where something periodically goes awry. But whatever the reason, there seems to be a group for whom Switch 2's Ethernet port just isn't functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Asking around the NL office, it's blank faces, (un)fortunately. Either a wireless connection is sufficient and we haven't ever bothered wiring up the dock, or we just haven't experienced any issues.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/ethernet_port_on_switch_2_docks_failing_for_many_people">our forums</a> and <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/some-switch-2-ethernet-docks-are-malfunctioning.14103/">the wider internet</a> are filled with people who have had issues. Some have sent their docks back to Nintendo with varying degrees of success; others have found that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l6q47u/comment/n1rse3p">connecting their phones via a USB cable</a> somehow resets the chip and managed to get their Ethernet back up and running, if only temporarily.</p>

<p>Naturally, Nintendo has its error codes and <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68592">related pages</a>, but assuming that using a different Ethernet cable doesn't solve your problem, opening up a report ticket with Nintendo is the only option they're offering.</p>
<p>Obviously, this issue will be frustrating if it impacts you, but we're keen to get a sense of just how many people this is affecting. As with any electronic device, there'll be a percentage of failures or manufacturing faults that crop up that'll need attention, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">10.36 million people</a> (and counting) picking up a Switch 2 in the first few months, there are bound to be some malfunctioning units - but how widespread is the problem?</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll below if you've experienced any issues with a wired internet connection - and if / how you've solved the problem.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1752ef6450e0d"><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1752ef6450e0d/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you can turn your attention away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> for one moment, it seems we might have the very first leak from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>The Legend of Zelda Movie</strong></a> set.</p>
<p>While very little has been revealed about the film so far, it was confirmed earlier this month that the live-action is officially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">"in production" in New Zealand</a>. Now, in an update this week, footage has supposedly emerged of the production, including some clips featuring cast members and the film crew.</p>
<p>This is where this rumour possibly enters <strong>spoiler territory</strong>, so if you don't want any surprises ahead of official updates, navigate away from this page now. Right, with the spoiler warning out of the way, the first video that's been uploaded on Instagram shows two characters in a forest, surrounded by horses (with one horse equipped with some gear featuring what looks to be the Hylian Crest).</p>

<p>The first actor is believed to be Bo Bragason as Zelda, who is dressed in an outfit that looks similar to her clothing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, and the second actor (who we haven't heard about up until now) is apparently the Aussie and Tibetan actress Dichen Lachman, known for her current role in the Apple TV+ exclusive, Severance. She's also previously worked with director Wes Ball on Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.</p>
<p>As for who she is playing? Based on the footage, fans are already convinced she'll be Impa. Long-time Zelda players will know Impa is a recurring character in the Zelda series, who has been depicted as the bodyguard and mentor of the Princess.</p>
<p>The second scene doing the rounds looks to feature an older version of the series' protagonist Link in his green tunic, which he has appeared in across multiple games, including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess</a>. The footage in this upload even shows him putting on a cloak, and some fans think his horse Epona is also on display in the other clip.</p>

<p>We'd be surprised if the original clips stay up if they are the real deal. Of course, for now, it's probably best to treat this supposed leak as a rumour, but we will say the footage certainly looks the part, and casting someone from across the ditch (<em>aka Australia</em>) would check out, given the location of the production.</p>
<p>Apart from Zelda's casting, the only other actor officially confirmed for the Legend of Zelda Movie is Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. As for the story, some basic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">descriptions have popped up online</a>, but that's about it. This live-action film is currently scheduled to arrive in cinemas in <strong>May 2027</strong>, and you can find out more about it in our guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>This week has been surprisingly busy, huh? We've had a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reveals-rosalina-bowser-jr-and-more">brand-new trailer</a> for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> along with confirmation that Brie Larson and Benny Safdie are joining the cast as Rosalina and Bowser Jr. We also finally received the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-the-trailer-weve-been-waiting-for">we've been waiting for</a>, while the lovely Alex has provided his thoughts on the game so far in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">early preview</a>.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption has also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/its-official-red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-switch-2-this-december">confirmed for the Switch 2</a>, while Nintendo also launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-launches-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-search-page">backward compatibility tool</a> in which you can check if your favourite Switch games work correctly on Switch 2.

<p>Now, with that out of the way, let's see what we're getting up to this weekend...</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Still lots of Resident Evil this weekend. I'm playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> again, which is comfortably one of my least favourite entries. It's still a good time, mind you, if only because the developers basically looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and said "hey, let's just do that again!". So the basics are solid.</p>
<p>I've been dipping back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> recently too, and it's really quite fun. I've even grown somewhat fond of free-roam mode. Bonkers.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I finally bit the bullet and bought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. I hope you’re happy. I know that I certainly won’t be, when I arrive back on Monday morning having spent 15+ hours getting overly emotionally-invested in a fictional frog wizard.</p>
<p>This game looks like it will scratch such an itch for me, so brace for ‘Jim becoming increasingly insufferable’ in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>The end-of-the-year release rush has begun! This will be my first time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> so I am quite eager to jump back into the streets of Kamurochō. Same applies for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a>. Great progress last week in with both Prometheus and Chronos defeated at long last. But of course Melinöe’s journey is not over yet… and neither is Princess Zelda’s in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> where I hope to clear Chapter 4 over this weekend.</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. I wasn’t quite sure this would ever get out of development hell and despite the lack of physical edition I dived head-first into it. I am rather surprised with the story mode because it is everything a current gen Pokémon game should be. Of course the over-the-top “Captain Tsubasa” style football (“soccer” for our American readers in the audience) action is where its at! Well played Level-5!</p>
