<p>With Switch 2 now hosting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur</a> and the like, have you got a case of GameCube fever? If so, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/misc_a_tiny_tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a> might be just the soothing ointment you need to apply generously all over your body. Lead developer Michael Pearce has said it was inspired by the games of his youth, and it only takes a glance at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/misc-a-tiny-tale-will-fill-the-chibi-robo-sized-hole-in-your-heart-this-july">the trailer</a> to see that those games must surely have included GameCube favourites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo!</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. Taking that retro inspiration, Misc is a 3D platformer featuring a teeny-weeny robot bobbling about and helping people in a quirky post-human world.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157252/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The debut release from Tinyware Games, Misc was made by a core team of three, winning funding from the Australian government along the way. It was developed for Nintendo Switch (which is the version reviewed here) and PC but, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/misc-a-tiny-tale-looks-super-smooth-on-switch-2-thanks-to-a-dev-hunch">as reported on Nintendo Life last month</a>, Tinyware took a punt on Switch 2’s approach to backwards compatibility, meaning the new console does deliver a significant boost in graphics and performance – but more on that later.</p>
<p>The story revolves around an inch-tall robot named Buddy and his friend Bag Boy – a unicycle robot with a paper bag on his head. One day, they hear an explosion in their little garden village, then set out on an adventure to find out what it was. As they go, they visit other locales peppered with friendly robo-characters to lend a hand to, run errands for, or trade with.</p>
<p>As simple as the story is, it’s nice to go on a quest just because something went bang, not because the world’s ending again – and it doesn’t hold back on throwing in some dramatic moments later on. This is supported well by the music, which has a storybook quality, some eerie moments, and even a few songs for the emotional peaks.</p>
<p>Each village area you visit on Buddy’s odyssey has a locked exit gate and a scattering of collectibles. There’s not too many — no collectathon trinket fixation here — and they’re split between major golden cogs and minor metal nuts. The metal nuts are more plentiful, left in short trails to nudge you around the level, while the golden cogs are the keys to opening the gates. Each area has ten cogs, with eight required for progression. A little icing on that quite appetising collectibles cake is a feel-good "Difference Made" system (think Chibi-Robo’s Happy Points) which counts up your positive influence on the world as you potter about litter-picking and scrubbing goop.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157200/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But collecting golden cogs is the backbone of the game. You mainly get them either by completing tasks for NPCs — find a shiny trinket or complete a set of sheet music — or by performing daring feats of platforming and exploration. The platforming is all low-stakes stuff — there are no lives to lose or anything like that — but when you fall, you will be left having to retrace your steps, which can sometimes be a bit of a downer.</p>
<p>Alongside some retrying, the jump-feel takes a bit of getting used to. It’s floaty by design, with Buddy having a propeller on his head to extend his air time, and the camera will need plenty of manual nudging to get sight of both where you’re aiming and where your drop shadow’s going. It was a good decision on Tinyware’s part to put the most challenging jumping in separate underground sections — one on each level — without any golden cogs riding on it. Tucking the 'real' platforming away in break-outs like this reminded me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>’s wooden-block courses – another GameCube reminiscence.</p>

<p>While we’re on the subject of controls, there are duck and dive manoeuvres that are almost never needed, as if they’d been forgotten, and a stamina gauge to throttle your sprinting that just seemed unnecessary to me. Misc does control well once you’ve clicked with it, but these details make it feel just a little bit baggy.</p>
<p>Most of the action happens in outdoor settings a bit reminiscent of Pikmin. However, a graphical comparison with Switch contemporary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> is not <em>especially</em> flattering. The environments are varied, particularly later in the game, although they sometimes seem a little barren. While most levels don’t feel like places characters might actually live, their charm and creativity still come through.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Switch isn’t doing the game any favours: it simply can’t render the game at its best. Resolution is low, and distant assets are hard to make out, with a lot of shimmering. The default setting for focus blur is a little heavy-handed — not so much Vaseline on the lens as a custard pie — obscuring anything at a distance and making it hard to get your bearings. Once I discovered I could turn the blur off, it didn’t go back on – for simple playability more than aesthetics.</p>

<p>And that little bit of navigation help was really needed in some villages. I eventually managed to frame the levels around distinctive landmarks, but scouring places for the last couple of cogs sometimes led to walking — albeit rather cutely — in circles. As I climbed up the same stack of buckets for the fourteenth time, even Bag Boy starting giving me funny looks. Add some invisible walls and blocked gaps that look like you could go through them, and more than once I was ready to move on before having the required cogs.</p>
<p>A test on Switch 2 told a different story altogether. The resolution at distance is great, movement is much smoother, and load times are shorter. I still preferred to have the blur turned off, but the ability to survey levels properly from high vantage points helped no end in finding my way around. Again, though, it’s the Switch 1 'version' under review here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Misc. A Tiny Tale is a charming and delightful first effort from Tinyware – albeit with some wobbles in execution. It sticks very close to classic ideas and struggles with graphical fidelity on Switch, but none of that can undo the charm of the characters and the retro vibe straight from the GameCube era. Until Chibi-Robo hits Nintendo Classics, this will serve all your miniature robot helper needs.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Kirby / Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3fe9717829e88/kirby-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Masahiro Sakurai has taken to <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1943507920794325484">social media</a> to provide a small, but welcome update on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> while also paying tribute to Satoru Iwata, the former president of Nintendo who passed away on 11th July 2015.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/masahiro-sakurai-commemorates-kirby-air-rides-22nd-anniversary-and-10-years-since-satoru-iwatas-passing/">Automaton</a>, Sakurai states that Kirby Air Riders is "shaping up to be something great" as he celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> on GameCube. While it's hardly the most detailed update imaginable, it will still no doubt fuel excitement for those looking forward to Air Riders' upcoming release.</p>
<p>Sakurai also recognised the 10th anniversary of Iwata's death, and pondered on how he would soon be the same age as Iwata at the time of his passing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today was the release date of the GameCube's Kirby Air Ride. 22nd anniversary!!</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also the anniversary of Iwata-san's passing. 2015.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed since then…<br>
Iwata-san and I were about ten years apart in age and when we joined the company, and soon I'll be catching up to his age, won't I?</p>
<p>Right now, I'm pouring my heart into making Kirby Air Riders.<br>
It's shaping up to be something great!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirby Air Riders was announced as part of the Switch 2 Direct back in April this year. No further information has been shared, but it's scheduled to launch at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>In what would be one of his final YouTube videos, Sakurai also paid tribute to Iwata in a 'Grab Bag' special, during which he recounted several memories of the legendary Nintendo executive.</p>

<p>No ROMs for you!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53beccc0d116e/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A major Switch ROM site – 'nsw2u' – has been seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, nsw2u was one of the better-known repositories of Switch ROMS, which allowed users with hacked Switch consoles to download first and third-party games at will; often before their official release dates. In other words, then, it's a website that Nintendo was probably keen to vaporise quicker than Thanos snapping his fingers.</p>
<p>The full message reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with a seizure warrant issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2323 issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia as part of a law enforcement operation and action by: Federal Bureau of Investigation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo has been very strict in recent years over piracy related to Switch software, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-has-seemingly-taken-possession-of-the-ryujinx-switch-emulator-website">taking possession of the Ryujinx emulator site</a> in 2024 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-is-handed-another-lawsuit-win-after-accused-switch-pirate-fails-to-plead">winning a legal case against the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit</a>.</p>
<p>It's not clear at this stage what might happen with nsw2u in the long run, but we'd wager that the site probably won't be coming back online anytime soon.</p>
<figure><a title="Site Seizure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b36b44021935d/site-seizure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: FBI</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding the Switch 2, it became clear soon after launch that those utilising MiG carts would be banned from online services on the console. This <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">drew the attention of Brazil's consumer rights watchdog</a>, who filed a complaint with Nintendo arguing that the latter's policy violates users' rights to access the services that they've paid for.</p>
