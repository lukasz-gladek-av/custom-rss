            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Rumours have been rumbling about Valve — the Washington-based developer responsible for creating Steam, but for also bringing us some of the best games ever made such as <strong>Half-Life</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a>, and <strong>Counter Strike</strong> — announcing some brand new hardware for a few days now.</p>
<p>And earlier today, multiple press outlets have revealed they've gone hands-on with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/hardware">three new pieces of Steam-compatible kit</a>: a brand new controller, a "streaming-first" headset, and what is basically a game console. The Steam Controller, Steam Frame, and Steam Machine, to give them their proper names.</p>
<p>And while the controller and headset look cool, the Steam Machine is the one that's caught most people's eyes, and for good reason: it looks an awful lot like a GameCube, doesn't it?</p>
<p>The resemblance is pretty striking. The Steam Machine is just a little black cube, measuring at approximately 6-inches, just a little bigger than our favourite purple 'Cube from the 00s, which comes in at 5.9 × 6.3 × 4.3 inches (sans the Game Boy Player, though the Steam Machine looks like it <em>basically</em> has one of those).</p>

<p>We're not the only people to make the comparison either; "It's not an Xbox, it's not a GameCube" Game File's Stephen Totilo posted on Bluesky shortly after the Machine's reveal. The Verge's Tom Warren opted to give it the cheeky nickname the "<a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1988671431211905535">GabeCube</a>".</p>
<p>Still, it <em>is</em> missing a handle, but it does have a customisable face plate. Not quite the same as the little GameCube logo on top of the console, but similar enough. It's sleek, small, and we're a little envious.</p>

<p>Our friends over at Digital Foundry have <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/hands-on-with-steam-machine-valves-new-pcconsole-hybrid">an excellent run-down of the new console</a> (alongside the other two peripherals) if you want more details.</p>
<p>Prices will be revealed at a later date, but the console is due to arrive in early 2026. Oh, but if Valve doesn't release a handle within a few months of the Steam Machine's release, well, they've missed a trick, we reckon.</p>
<p>But it's good to see the old cubic design back in full force. The GameCube <em>truly</em> is perfect, design wise, isn't it?</p>

<p>The Evil Empire expands</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've assumed that it would be coming our way for some time now, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> developer Evil Empire has today finally given its slick roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, a Switch release date.</p>
<p>This one will be arriving on the eShop (for both Switch <em>and</em> Switch 2) on <strong>16th December</strong>, with a physical edition following behind on <strong>10th April 2026</strong>... albeit as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>We've been keeping an eye on this one ever since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/prince-of-persia-roguelite-from-dead-cells-dev-revealed-switch-not-confirmed">first revealed</a> early last year, but just in case it hasn't popped up on your radar yet, here's a brief rundown of what you can expect.</p>
<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is a roguelike that mixes stylish platforming action with build-based combat. You can expect procedurally-generated levels, over 100 different weapons and medallions to power-up your build, and lots (we mean <em>lots</em>) of Dead Cells-style retries.</p>
<p>We've included some pictures of the platforming action below, so you can get an idea of what you can expect.</p>

<p>After a time in early access, this one launched on Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series earlier this year. It has since racked up over 1,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on PC, so let's hope that the Switch's portability promise can keep the good times coming when it arrives for us next month.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It only feels like yesterday that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> finally made its way onto the Switch, and yet here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">a beefed-up Switch 2 version</a>. This new release is effectively the same game, but Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have taken advantage of the newer console’s specs for a much smoother, crisper experience.</p>
<p>Crucially, the frame rate has been greatly improved here, sticking to 60fps that (to my eyes, at least) never falters. It makes exploring Kamurocho all the more enjoyable, and even the busiest scraps with Yakuza thugs run smoothly. The resolution has been bumped up considerably in docked and handheld, bringing it more in line with launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>. It looks wonderful.</p>
<p>And yes, the game itself is still the same, which, in my opinion, is a good thing. There’s really nothing else quite like Yakuza, except maybe, well… other Yakuza games. You’ve got this super-compelling narrative at its core involving backstabbing criminals, corrupt politicians, and devoted friends that succumb to darkness, and it does a great job at keeping you engaged with superb Japanese voice performances (no Western dub here, though).</p>
<p>It’s stuffed with utterly ridiculous moments that, in anything else, would undoubtedly detract from the overarching plot, but it just works so well here. You can play bowling, pool, darts, and even sing karaoke. The juxtaposition between the serious narrative and the ludicrous sidequests is sublime – it’s just such a <em>video game</em>.</p>
<p>A lot of the focus is on melee combat, and with the combination of several distinct fighting styles with the option to purchase a plethora of upgrades throughout, it never quite loses its edge. Swapping between Rush, Brawler, Beast, and Dragon styles provides ample variety, and if you don’t fancy using your fists, you can always just pick up a bicycle and smash it into your foes' faces. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>Some aspects can be a little grating, for sure. Boss fights go on for a little too long at times, while the overall pacing isn’t quite as satisfying as the aforementioned Yakuza 0. This is fundamentally a 2016 remake of a 2005 game, and the developers have taken great strides in subsequent years to polish the series further and ditch the features and mechanics that don’t <em>quite</em> work.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’d still recommend starting with Yakuza 0 if you’re completely new to the series, but Kiwami is a perfectly fine place to dive in, too. It doesn’t feel quite so bloated as some of the later entries, yet it still flexes a peerless sense of style at every opportunity. Playing Kiwami portably on Switch 2 is a joy, and I sincerely hope Sega brings the entire series to the console. It’s found itself a great home.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami]]></content:encoded>
