Known for its cosy atmosphere, warm character, humour, and iconic art, Dragon Quest is due a big year, and Square Enix is kicking things off with a brand new "reimagining" — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined.</a></p>
<p>Bringing what is regarded as one of the longest RPGs of the PlayStation era to Switch 1 and Switch 2, Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined has attracted joy — and a few raised eyebrows — for streamlining events and making a few tweaks to the game. What was a 100+ hour experience (or 70-ish-hours on 3DS) is now much leaner. So, how to you retain the magic when you're trying to appeal to new audiences, but make sure that old fans are satisfied?</p>
<p>We had a chance to ask the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, a few questions about the upcoming reimagining — which, for the record, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">we absolutely loved</a>. Ichikawa has worked on the Dragon Quest series since 2018, starting out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> as an assistant producer.</p>
<p>As a long-time fan of the series, we asked him about his experience with the original PS version, what changes were difficult to make, and whether the team got to share their work with the series' artist, the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Before we dive into Reimagined, can you share with us the first time you experienced Dragon Quest VII, and what you thought of the game - PlayStation or 3DS version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeshi Ichikawa, Producer of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined:</strong> I was in the lower grades of elementary school when I first played the PlayStation version. I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?” and I don’t think I managed to clear the whole game back then.</p>
<p>When I played it again as an adult, I was able to complete it successfully, and I found the dark world filled with irrationality especially striking and modern.</p>
<figure data-uuid="84316e918d5fb"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84316e918d5fb/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>There’s a lot of pressure to keep the traditions of Dragon Quest intact while modernising certain aspects. How do you juggle those expectations with a game like Dragon Quest VII Reimagined?</strong></p>
<p>As a major title with a passionate fanbase, there was certainly pressure. However, the excitement of being able to deliver this beloved franchise in a way that feels fresh outweighed it, and I believe we were able to enjoy the development process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Having worked on previous Dragon Quest games before in various different ways, how different is it working on a remake like Reimagined to say, a mainline entry such as Dragon Quest XI or a spin-off like Dragon Quest Builders 2?</strong></p>
<p>In a remake, we believe it’s essential not only to offer players a fresh experience but also to preserve the charm of the original version. Striking the right balance between these two is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Given that it’s a big year for Dragon Quest in 2026 with the 40th anniversary, why is this year the right time to return to Dragon Quest VII? And why kick off the celebrations with this one?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past originally released in 2000 - so this year is its 26th Anniversary! Because of this, we felt it was the perfect time to bring its storytelling and unique atmosphere to a wider audience - especially now, in today’s world.</p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined not only “reimagines” the story and emotional portrayal of its characters but also makes the game significantly more approachable and accessible. We believe this game will be enjoyable for both previous DRAGON QUEST VII players and newcomers alike!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6e3829828eaf"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6e3829828eaf/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What attracted you to the diorama style that’s used in Reimagined? Why did you decide to go with something completely different, as opposed to the HD-2D style used for Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest I &amp; II?</strong></p>
<p>The original DRAGON QUEST VII was defined by Akira Toriyama’s designs, featuring charming, stylized characters. We considered how to convey that cuteness while still capturing the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the same time, we discovered that movies and games featuring doll motifs were well-received globally, which inspired us to combine this concept with DRAGON QUEST VII’s character designs. We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to the visual expression seen in the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama. However, as mentioned earlier, we kept in mind throughout production that the visual style needed to match the charm of his adorable illustrations.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Quest is usually known for being lighthearted and charming – at least, it always feels very cozy to us! But Dragon Quest VII is often considered one of the darker entries. How do you balance this and do you make any changes in Reimagined to lean more one way rather than the other?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is a work whose appeal lies in two aspects: the irrational and dark scenarios encountered throughout the journey, and the exciting coming-of-age story of an ordinary boy growing into the savior of the world. This title preserves that appeal while reimagining it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8152e720c2622"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8152e720c2622/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You’ve talked about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">streamlining the game’s narrative</a> and the discussions you had on which scenarios you wanted to keep, rather than get rid of. How tough was it to cut the sections you eventually settled on, and do you have a favourite that was a must-keep for the final game?</strong></p>
<p>We felt that reimagining the scenario was necessary to create a more fast-paced and immersive narrative experience. Throughout the process, we consciously made adjustments to ensure that the original version’s unique atmosphere and core story remained intact.</p>
<p><strong>If you were to sum up Dragon Quest VII Reimagined in one sentence (or one word if you want a challenge), what would it be?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title allows you to experience the irrational nature of the world and the exciting story of growth that lies beyond.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, to wrap up this interview, what does Dragon Quest mean to you? And how will you be celebrating the 40th anniversary?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is the story of the growth of a boy from humble beginnings, and I hope that, through developing this title, I too have grown. I would be delighted if this game could serve as the beginning of delivering a wonderful 40th anniversary celebration of DRAGON QUEST to everyone.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>This interview has been slightly edited for clarity and flow.</em></p>
<p>Thank you to Ichikawa-san and the team at Square Enix for making the time to speak to us.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined launches on Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>. Will this be your first time playing the game, or did you play it on PlayStation or 3DS? Let us know down below!</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-will-carefully-consider-a-switch-2-price-increase-says-furukawa</link>
            <guid>1424293</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2af72df597d2f"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2af72df597d2f/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest financial report <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/switch-2-storms-towards-its-forecast-target-with-17-37-million-units-sold">paints a positive picture for the Switch 2</a>, with the console comfortably outpacing, well, pretty much everything that's come before it. Since launching in June 2025, its now shifted an astonishing 17.37 million units, and is well on track to hit its forecasted target on 19 million for the fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, comments from Nintendo's President, Shuntaro Furukawa, may raise a few eyebrows as we head towards the end of FY2026 and into FY2027 (thanks, <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/markets/world-indices/TUUSCEPJHBPUHI4W2N5VLZTRAA-2026-02-03/">Reuters</a>). Naturally, with memory prices rises exponentially thanks to the advent of AI, questions regarding a potential price increase for the Switch 2 are lingering.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Furukawa provided the most corporate-laced answer imaginable; one that we're certain won't assuage fears anytime soon. He simply said that Nintendo would "carefully consider the matter while taking a comprehensive look at the state of adoption of the platform, current sales trends, costs, profitability, market environment, and other factors."</p>
<p>So it could go either way, then.</p>
<p>As further covered by <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF2760P0X20C26A1000000/">Nikkei</a>, Furukawa also concedes that the rising memory prices may impact the company's financial performance in the future, though there are no immediate risks for the remainder of the fiscal year. When discussing the upcoming financial year, Furukawa said "If prices continue to rise for a long period of time, it could put pressure on profits from the next fiscal year onwards".</p>
<p>So despite the Switch 2 performing exceptionally well in its first year, the situation is undoubtedly more complex. It's not just a case of "console sells well, money goes up"; there are many factors to consider, and it seems that memory prices may well have a pretty huge impact in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>We'll keep a close eye on how Nintendo deals with the situation and provide further updates as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a6f9a599310d5"><a title="Mario Tennis Fever" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a6f9a599310d5/mario-tennis-fever.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are rapidly approaching launch day for Nintendo's next first-party release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and, following a series of hands-on sessions, the final previews are starting to roll in.</p>
<p>While we here at Nintendo Life don't have a full written preview for Mario's latest sporting shenanigans, the wonderful Ollie Reynolds sat down with equally wonderful Alex Olney to talk through his time with the game. "It's more Mario Tennis," Ollie said, "and if you like that sort of thing, you're going to be absolutely thrilled".</p>
<p>While Ollie's time was mainly limited to brief multiplayer matches, he did sing the praises of the new Fever rackets and Wonder Flower-filled challenge courts. You'll find his full conversation with Alex about all things Mario Tennis Fever (and NSO Virtual Boy, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder - Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>) in the video below.</p>

<p>But we're not the only ones who have stepped onto the Fever court today! Several other outlets have also shared their early opinions, and we've rounded up a bunch of them so you can get an idea of what everyone makes of it so far.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/mario-tennis-fever-hands-on-preview-534201-20260203">GamingBible</a>'s preview, which seemed very positive about the whole experience, particularly the promise of varied gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the sheer number of Fever Rackets on offer though paired with an impressive teaser of what special matches add into the mix, I’m hopeful that this game has all of the right ingredients to deliver</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2026/02/03/mario-tennis-fever-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-virtual-boy-previews-26673543/">Metro</a> seemed similarly optimistic, praising the potential for chaos that the new mechanics and gimmicks bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s frantic, it’s daft, and it’s sure to be a fun family party game, even if it’s not a serious tennis sim</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mario-tennis-fever-preview-switch-2/">Polygon</a> felt that Fever might just be the best Mario sports title in years, and a worthy start to the Switch 2 generation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the full scope of its content suite is still a question mark, long-time developer Camelot is poised to deliver a strong serve for its Switch 2 debut. The fundamental play of a Mario sports game hasn’t felt this good in over a decade</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-leans-way-harder-on-the-mario-than-the-tennis">IGN</a>'s preview sung many of the same praises outlined above, but it also gave a shoutout to the "fantastic" visuals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s nice to see developer Camelot’s Switch 2 debut looking so clean, especially after 2021’s Mario Golf: Super Rush was downright ugly at times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baby Waluigi's presence made a headline appearance in <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-preview/">The Gamer</a>'s coverage, which appreciated how you can bring the tennis back to basics, if you so choose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, some of these abilities do take the actual skill out of tennis and can boil matches down to simply spamming fever shots and hoping the RNG of tornadoes and splashes will be enough to win the day. Thankfully, there is an option to turn off these gimmicks and play the old-fashioned way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-mario-tennis-fever-sets-itself-apart-from-other-recent-mario-sports-games/1100-6537844/">GameSpot</a> left the preview equally intrigued, hoping that the full game can keep up the variety and depth found in the hands-on section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't say whether it has course-corrected on the single-player, but the multiplayer is so chockablock with options and game-changing effects that I'm intrigued</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Well, there you have it! It sounds like Mario Tennis Fever is shaping up to be a rather interesting one when it launches on Switch 2 on <strong>12th February</strong>.</p>
<p>If Ollie and Alex's chat that we mentioned back at the start of this post has whetted your appetite for previews of the written variety, then you'll find our hands-on thoughts of Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, Pragmata and the Virtual Boy NSO library below.</p>
