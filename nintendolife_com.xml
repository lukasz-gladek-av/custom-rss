<p><em>"Stellar? It's a chaotic mess!"</em> Indeed it is, and well met, my friend. However, that's exactly why it's so damn good, so stop shouting at me.</p>
<p>Also, it's only a mess when you don't know what you're doing. That's right, and as I tried to impress in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">my 8/10 review</a>, once you know what you're doing in Kirby Air Riders, and once you take that knowledge with you into the online realm...well, it's a surprisingly strategic thing. There's a way to play well and a way to play badly, and luck doesn't come into it nearly as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>, with its back-of-the-pack power-up boosts and blue shell upsets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adwuogmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Nope. If you know the score in City Trials, as is the case with any race on any track in this game, you'll reap the rewards directly, and so being able to quickly grab the best power-ups (that's all those ludicrously massive icons that littler the arena) alongside a proper knowledge of the fastest routes, most protected avenues, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-how-to-reach-city-trials-floating-garden-and-floating-island">secret areas</a>, and all that jazz, will make you a winner. Oh, wonderful skill-based racing with a high-skill ceiling - you <em>were</em> hiding in there all along.</p>

<p>So. Given that I'm rightly enamoured with the air riding here, and given that I've been so impressed by a game that manages to remove acceleration control (one of the best bits of driving) whilst still remaining more strategic and engaging than other racers of its ilk, it's shame to have a complaint, but I do.</p>
<p>As we reported a little while back, Kirby Air Riders creator and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> guru Masahiro Sakurai has said that there will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sakurai-has-no-plans-for-kirby-air-riders-dlc-everything-is-here">not be any more DLC for the game</a>. Sad (and also slightly spoiled) face. And it's a sad face because as much as I adore City Trial, I think its biggest strengths are drawn from and highlighted by its map - as a map you have to learn so well.</p>
<p>However, in having to get so very familiar with it to succeed against the best that online play can throw at you, only having the one to play on is something that's gonna limit my time with this one, and maybe, ultimately, bring it to a premature end.</p>
<p>If I was aware of even one new City Trial map coming down the pipeline, I'd be confident in the fact that Kirby Air Riders would remain on my Switch 2 indefinitely. And it still may do, by the way, because I just can't get enough of Rick.</p>
<p><em>Why</em>? Well, because he's a huge and cuddly hamster and I love him. But that's a different story.</p>

<p>No, what I mean is <em>why</em> can't we just have one more map? It's not an issue in any way in the rest of the game's modes, and the minigames that see out a round of City Trial are superb - nothing needs doing there.</p>
<p>Indeed, I fully feel as though Sakurai is being 100% genuine in his "<em>Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start"</em> statement when announcing that DLC was a no-go. I just...can't we just have even one more? (How hard can it be to design a breathtakingly brilliant map that works in solo <em>and</em> online play for player counts that vary wildly? I mean, <em>come on.</em>)</p>
<p>There's a ton of content here when you dig into Air Ride, there's endless reams of stuff to unlock and collect in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-playable-characters-and-how-to-unlock-for-every-game-mode">characters</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-tracks-and-how-to-unlock">tracks</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-machines-and-how-to-unlock">machines</a> in Road Trip, but the very nature of City Trials, with its hyper-fixation on this single (admittedly large and very well thought-out) Skyah map, surely means that it'll only continue to thrive and surprise if they chuck more maps in there for the long-term riders to tuck into.</p>
<p>C'mon, Nintendo. Let us feast on the fun of learning another area inside out whilst crushing our foes in online match-ups.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is just days out from launch, and in case you missed it, you can redeem the eShop version of this title with a Nintendo Switch Game Voucher. You could also grab this version with a voucher and then pay to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p>
<p>This follows the news in July that Nintendo would be discontinuing Switch Online Vouchers. Although these vouchers will no longer be sold after <strong>30th January 2026</strong>, Nintendo has said it will continue to add Switch titles to the voucher catalogue throughout the same year. Vouchers will remain valid for 12 months from the purchase date.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>One of the other titles to recently join the Switch voucher program was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which you can also pay to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Nintendo hasn't announced if it will release a similar voucher program for the Switch 2 (<em>at least for now</em>), but if we hear anything, we'll let you know.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194232,194327 @ 1764421279 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This is my final weekend before <em>all the games</em> release, so I'm determined to wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> and get a run or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> under my belt. Yes, these are the same two games that I have been playing every weekend for weeks now, and no, I will not apologise for that.</p>
<p>I'm already nervously eyeing all the titles I'll want to pick up in the next seven days, so I'll be trying to enjoy having some money while I can. That said, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/switch-2-black-friday-deals-are-a-bit-meh-but-here-are-the-best-weve-seen">Black Friday deal</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that's looking <em>particularly</em> tempting...</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a> a shot this weekend if I get chance – it looks so cool! Other than that, a quick dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> before the fourth entry drops sounds like it might be on the cards. Have a good weekend, folks!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>I forgot to mention that last weekend I went to the 10th edition of Lisboa Games Week. As one of the leading video game culture shows in Portugal, it is always a great place to meet old friends, make new ones and play the latest upcoming chart toppers. Nintendo had the biggest show floor ever, right at the main entrance, so it was impossible to miss all that Switch 2 red-tinted area. I was surprised to have play time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, both running their demo builds quite smoothly. The main reason that made me not stay at home was hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>… and I was smiling the whole way. The latest entry in the series came out in 2007, I was an entirely different person back then. With the imminent release, I am clearing my schedule to ensure that it is all Samus Aran from next week onwards (and yes, my head is still back there, I got me a bad case of post-convention blues!).</p>
<p>My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. Will I be able to complete it before next week? Certainly not. Will I be redecorating the streets of Kamurochō with every street thug foolish enough to look me sideways until then? Put your money on the Dragon of Dojima, and you will never be poor again.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>Not much time for gaming this weekend, as the HOLIDAY TIME has begun. I've got a Christmas party, a Christmas craft market, a house Christmas decoration plan, and a (not-Christmas) D&amp;D session.</p>
<p>But I did just buy <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a> in the Steam Sale, like I said I would last week. So mayyyyyybe I can find the time in between all the Christmas...</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing and loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> update has got me surveying the state of my museum. Bugs, fossils, and fish-wise, I'm 100% complete, but my art gallery is perhaps 20% finished. So, I've started hitting Redd up on Harv's Island to see about changing that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I'm dipping into the Namco DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_namco_legendary_pack">Atari 50</a>, and the kids are intrigued by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>, so it might be time for a Reroll. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> marks a completely new story where the legendary bounty hunter Samus Aran is unexpectedly transported to the unknown planet Viewros. As you've probably already seen, she's also joined by a team of Galactic Federation soldiers.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-difficulty-settings-revealed-by-nintendo">same recently published article</a> on Nintendo's Japanese website, there's an official introduction to the team of soldiers who have also been transported to the same location. Throughout this new adventure, Samus will work and fight alongside all of these characters to return home alive.</p>
<p>If you don't want any <strong>spoilers</strong>, you might want to navigate away from this page right now. Below is a look at each of the Galactic Federation soldiers and a description. Apart from MacKenzie's description (based on the in-game logbook which has already been shared online), the other descriptions are <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/troopers/index.html">translated from Nintendo's website</a>.
