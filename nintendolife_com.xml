<p>Gee Bee lands tomorrow</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The next <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> title coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 buzzes onto the consoles tomorrow, <strong>2nd October 2025</strong>, and it's the first-title Toru Iwatani — the creator of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/pac-man">Pac-Man</a> — developed for Namco.</p>
<p>The 1978 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_gee_bee">Gee Bee</a> is the next game in Hamster's huge catalogue of ports. Notably, Gee Bee was the first ever arcade game designed in-house at Namco. The game will be <strong>$7.99</strong> on Switch 1,and <strong>$9.99</strong> on Switch 2 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>On both consoles, the game will support mouse controls — on Switch 1, that means plugging in a USB mouse, while Mouse Mode on Switch 2 will work straight away.</p>
<p>This is essentially a block breaker game, though with a little bit of a pinball table twist. You'll use a rotary dial to control paddles to hit balls towards the top of the screen.</p>
<p>While Gee Bee was a success, it underperformed in Namco's eyes. Still, without it, the arcade scene and Namco's own output may have been very different, so it's an important part of history.</p>

<p>Arcade Archives Gee Bee and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-gee-bee">Arcade Archives 2 Gee Bee</a> arrive on the eShop tomorrow. Will you be checking these out? Let us know in the comments.</p>
