<p>Still coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><em>Are</em>Fans are still speculating as to what exactly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/danganronpa-2x2">Danganronpa 2x2</a> is — part a remaster and rerelease of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_2_goodbye_despair_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa 2</a>, part a brand new scenario, the game is largely shrouded in mystery. But while we wait for more info (and a firmer 2026 release date), Spike Chunsoft has opened up pre-orders for the physical release of the game.</p>
<p>On both Switch 1 and Switch 2, Danganronpa 2x2 will be getting a standard physical release — stocked at various retailers for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> — which appears to include the game fully on the card for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Plus. there's a special collector's edition, appropriately-named the 'Psycho Tropical Vacation Package'. This will set you back <strong>$139.99 USD</strong> and includes a RSVLTS reversible Psycho Tropical hat, a Kidrobot 3" figure of bother tropical Monokuma and Monomi, an OST which includes remixes of the best tracks from the original game, and a clamshell-style outer box to display your collection in.</p>
<p>In addition, if you pre-order directly from <a href="https://store.spike-chunsoft.com/">Spike Chunsoft</a>'s Shopify page, you'll get a 4" Monokuma Flight Tag.</p>
<figure data-uuid="aee2552de968a"><a title="Danganronpa 2x2 Psycho Tropical Vacation Package" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aee2552de968a/danganronpa-2x2-psycho-tropical-vacation-package.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spike Chunsoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Canadian store <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/products/danganronpa-2x2-standard-edition-nintendo-switrch-pre-order?bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP</a> has also opened up pre-orders for the game for <strong>$84.99 CAD</strong> (or <strong>$194.99 CAD</strong> for the special edition). European European orders will be handled by Reef Entertainment.</p>
<p>We haven't seen much of Danganronpa 2x2 since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">its reveal at the September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, though it was shown off at the Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Fes: Ultimate Appreciation Festival back in November.</p>
<p>The "all new storyline" being added to this rerelease is reportedly meant to be as long as the base game, which means double the content. And probably double the shenanigans. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_v3_killing_harmony_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa V3</a>, anything is possible...</p>

<p>On <strong>17th February 2026</strong>, owners of the Nintendo Switch versions of both games will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Editions for free. And if you have the newer console, why wouldn't you? The price for the Switch 2 Edition straight-up hasn't been announced.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, you'll be able to play both games and 1440p and 60fps docked, while handheld is bumped to 1080p and 60fps. You all want to see some terrifying sea creatures in crisp, shiny visuals in the dark now, don't you? *shudders*</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ptsgqh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Controls have also been "optimized" for Switch 2, so perhaps there's some Mouse Mode integration there?</p>
<p>Both Subnautica games arrived on Switch 1 back in May 2021 and we enjoyed both of them a lot — though the first game <em>just</em> edges out Below Zero for us. If you've never played them before, then make sure you have a read of our reviews, <em>and</em> check out the rundown from the games' eShop page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining the award-winning game Subnautica with its sequel Subnautica Below Zero, this Nintendo Switch™ exclusive allows players to fully immerse themselves in the full mystery surrounding the water world of planet 4546B.</p>
<p>Craft equipment, pilot submarines and out-smart wildlife to explore lush coral reefs, volcanoes, cave systems, and more - all while trying to survive in both hostile water zones and frozen terrain.</p>
<p>Features:<br>
- Survival Is Key: Gather valuable materials, craft tools, manage your hunger and thirst, all while evading the dangerous wildlife that sees you as its next meal<br>
- Crash Landing on Planet 4546B: Beneath the serene waves of this aquatic planet are clues around its complicated history and how it warps the lives for all those that crash land there<br>
- Exploration: Delve into unique aquatic and terrain biomes that will unlock not only materials, but the answers that you seek<br>
- Build Your Habitat: Crafting and building the comforts of home here. These bases will be integral for your survival from not only the wildlife, but also the harsh environment around you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sequel, <strong>Subnautica 2</strong>, is due to come to Early Access 2026, but Switch 2 isn't one of the slated platforms for it.</p>
<p>Plus, the sequel's publisher Krafton (who acquired the dev in 2022) and Unknown Worlds are embroiled in a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">rather messy lawsuit</a>. Krafton has also attracted additional negative attention after it announced it was working on becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">an "AI first" company</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Well, that didn't take too long! After launching on the Switch eShop back in December, Dotemu and Tribute Games have today updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> to ver. 1.0.5, bundling in a fresh batch of hero colour palettes to boot.</p>
<p>The 'Cosmic Collabs' update includes a new wardrobe option for 12 of the 15-hero roster, each inspired by a different Marvel game. Spider-Man and Venom each get a crossover fit from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Black Panther and Rocket Racoon take theirs from <strong>Marvel Snap</strong> art, She-Hulk and Wolverine's new looks come from <strong>Marvel Strike Force</strong>, Captain America and Nova take inspiration from <strong>Marvel Future Fight</strong>, Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill's palettes are all about <strong>Marvel Contest of Champions</strong>, and even <strong>Marvel Puzzle Quest</strong> gets a nod in Storm and Iron Man's fresh threads.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. The update also includes its fair share of bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and new features, so you can be sure things are running smoother than ever before as you put these new palettes to the test.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753970?emclan=103582791475080003&amp;emgid=519737782627731794">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion Ver. 1.0.5 (10th Feb 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Epic MARVEL Games Collaborations!</strong></h3>
<p>We’re bringing in tributes to our favourite MARVEL Games experiences, including palettes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Rivals</strong></em> - Spider-Man and Venom</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Snap</strong></em> - Black Panther and Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Strike Force</strong></em> - She-Hulk and Wolverine</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Future Fight</strong></em> - Captain America and Nova</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Contest of Champions</strong></em> - Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Puzzle Quest</strong></em> - Storm and Iron Man</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>New Features!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hero Lab Upgrades</strong> - with new palette previews to help you get a great view of new cosmetic options, and a new Team Level indicator.</li>
<li><strong>Tweaked Arcade Modifiers</strong> - swinging into danger with modifications. The Double HP modifier is now an HP Multiplier - where enemy HP can now be multiplied by 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 times their standard amount!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay Improvements!</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve made a number of visual changes based on your feedback, designed to make it easier for you to keep up with the on-screen action, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroes will now be highlighted when HP is low</li>
<li>The Focus bar has been split to make it easier to read</li>
<li>Special Damage number visuals have been changed to red - making them easier to identify</li>
<li>The Heteropteron Level Larva Bug has been tweaked to make the enemy stand out. In addition, we’ve added flashes on the Larva during throw animations and introduced colour cycling effects on the attack!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also taken some time to go back for further balancing on boss fights, tweaking these to provide a little more fair play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hela</strong> - Increasing cooldowns for both Grudge and Hellblades attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Venom</strong> - Reducing block and parry actions and removing combo parry, increasing reaction cooldown, lowering damage on the Bite attack and removing some post-Grudge attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Phyla-Vell</strong> - Reducing block actions and lowering chance of using Cosmic Attack. We’ve also added cooldown on some attacks, increased the cooldown on cosmic Fury and lengthened the initial block action to prevent instant parry.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bug Fixes!</strong></h3>
<p>As well as all this, we’re squashing some bugs of our own!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a blocker caused by using Cosmic Ghost Rider’s special attack just before triggering a boss cutscene</li>
<li>Fixed an out-of-bounds issue when performing a dive attack during Master Mold’s Double Fist move</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where boss summons would not be defeated alongside the boss, if the summon is receiving damage from a player</li>

<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Hela to become permanently immobilized when parried and pushed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Taskmaster could become frozen in mid-air when hit during his jump attack (while playing online)</li>
<li>Fixed a missing animation with Venom’s Parry Attack which could cause loss of control</li>
<li>Fixed various issues related to Venom’s passive Slow effect for Standard Attack and Team Assist.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that would stop Storm from performing a combo if she performs a standard attack after being charged</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash if Sauron attacks an Enemy (or anything that's not a Player)</li>
<li>Fixed a Thanos-related crash when hit by a turret projectile</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which could cause a crash during follow-up attacks after Cosmic Ghost Rider’s Rising Attack</li>

<li>Added a Medkit and a breakable in the final area of Level 08</li>

<li>Enhanced spawn delay of Bug Barricade and Bug Larva, reduced Bug Larva spawn zones and altered the final Bug Larva attack delay on Level 13</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Even More Tweaks!</strong></h3>

<li>Fixed Captain America’s Pallette #2 from being described as a Corps File in the cosmic Matrix</li>
<li>Improved Cosmic Ghost Rider’s chain visuals during online play</li>
<li>Tweaked Spider-Man and Venom’s web grab connections</li>

<li>Fixed subtitles being cut off on certain lines</li>
<li>Tweaked item despawns to avoid risk of repetition for off-screen items</li>
<li>Added a failsafe for Web Pulled enemies so they don't get dragged pass the Player (and potentially cause invincibility)</li>
<li>Unlockable Super Heroes should no longer display greyed-out icons</li>
<li>Fixed drone positioning in Hala which could cause incorrect attack warnings</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause position de-syncing in online play</li>

</ul>
