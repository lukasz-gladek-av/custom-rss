<p>Button mashing is smashing, especially with friends</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've known for a while now, and as reported by our sister site Time Extension <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/taitos-track-and-field-esque-arcade-game-field-day-is-heading-to-ps4-and-switch-this-month">a week back</a>, Taito's 1984 classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arcade_archives_field_day">Field Day</a>, is on its way to Nintendo Switch consoles as part of the Arcade Archives series.</p>
<p>Now, Hamster has announced that the game will officially release on 31st July. Which is today. Holy timely news piece, Batman.</p>
<p>Field Day was amongst a whole crop of a very particular style of button-mashy sports game that popped up in the mid-'80s, mostly off the back of the enormous success of Konami's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_track_and_field">Track and Field</a>. This very writer whiled away copious hours playing most of them on his trusty Commodore 64, so can therefore confirm that the whole thing becomes very addictive if you let it get to you. These were as good as games looked back at the time, too, especially on home computers.</p>
<p>Of course, where Track and Field had regular sports games in a regular stadium sort of scenario, in this one you are taking part in a raft of challenges at a girl's school - stuff like tug-of-war, hence the name Field Day, which is like a Sports Day, right? Right?</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat antiquated look of this one, you must understand — and especially if you've never tried any of these sorts of games — that adding a second human player can lead to a category-10-level time sink. We're talking extinction-level event here. Well, not really. It does get bloody competitive, mind.</p>
<p>Also, some experts (or boffins, if you want) reckon this effort is actually more challenging than Track and Field, given its slightly odder collection of events. Here's some further details from Hamster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"FIELD DAY" is an action game released by TAITO in 1984.<br>
Players compete in a variety of seven non-conventional sporting events from three-legged race to tug-of-war in an effort to become the sports day champion.<br>
Each event features a qualifying score which must be met to progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Field Day releases today and costs £6.29/$7.99/€6.99</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has been out for a few weeks now, and unsurprisingly, players are still discovering all sorts of things about it.</p>
<p>Apart from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/random-donkey-kong-bananza-players-are-already-skipping-layers-and-transformations">new ways to speedrun the game</a>, as you've probably noticed, there's some lovely attention to detail, and it extends to DK's fur. <a href="http://suppermariobroth.com/">Supper Mario Broth</a> on social media notes how a full "Bananergy" meter will actually make DK's fur "slightly brighter".</p>
<p>Here's the post in full, along with a bit of extra detail about how exactly it works:</p>

<p>We've had a closer look at this ourselves and have taken multiple before-and-after shots in one of the layers with better lighting:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rlvyij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Additionally, Ys X: Proud Nordics will also feature 29 DLCs from the Switch release. The same outlet's review has also reconfirmed previous reports about the game featuring a performance mode that supports up to 120fps on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Apart from launching in Japan, Proud Nordics will also be made available for Switch 2 in Asia and is being distributed by Cloud Leopard Entertainment. If you haven't tried out the Switch version since its arrival last October, there's a demo available on the eShop.</p>
