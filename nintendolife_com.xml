</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 this October, and if you weren't already sold, Bandai Namco has now released a demo.</p>
<p>This "free demo" is available to download on the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms. It will give you a sample of the upcoming entry in the puzzle-platformer horror series, as you step into the Necropolis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Step into the Necropolis, the #LittleNightmares III demo is out now on all platforms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This demo release follows Bandai's news in June, confirming a Switch 2 "Enhanced Edition" for the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a>, which will also be made available next month. This version of the first game will run at 60FPS, includes higher resolution, faster loading times, and also comes with quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the recent announcements for the Little Nightmare's universe in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life:</p>

<p>Zombie hunter Juliet is back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>More Switch titles are slowly beginning to receive Switch 2 game upgrades, and Dragami Games has now announced its own plans for Juliet's zombie hack-and-slash <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lollipop_chainsaw_repop">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>.</p>
<p>The title will be getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition featuring "high frame rate", "high resolution", and it will be made available as an upgrade for existing Switch owners. It's scheduled to arrive at some point in November 2025. It hasn't been revealed just yet if this will be a free or paid upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<p>When this title arrived on the Switch last September, one of the main issues with the title was the performance and optimisation, so the Switch 2 version will hopefully sort these problems out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An idiosyncratic collaboration between Suda 51 and filmmaker James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw highlights the unique style of both creators. Itâ€™s a hyper-stylised, quip-heavy action game that remains a uniquely demented experience. Sadly, content omissions and some choppy performance hamper this remaster, tainting the colourful mayhem."</p>
