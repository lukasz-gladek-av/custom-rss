<hr>
<p>My first gaming memory: waking up in the middle of the night, heading downstairs, and booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_superstar_baseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a>'s campaign mode on my GameCube.</p>
<p>It was completely out of character, according to my parents, who still tell the story of my midnight gambit to this day. I had never dared transgress the norms of bedtime before, but my love for Mario and his cadre of ball-playing desperados drew me there – in front of the television in the wee hours of the morning, having the time of my life playing my favourite game. I was six. It was 2005.</p>
<p>Mario Superstar Baseball is reviewed as a completely mediocre game across the board. An ancillary Nintendo sports title developed primarily by Namco and released in the fog of the GameCube's dying breath. Yet it deserves its moment in the spotlight for its ability to show sports kids what makes Mario fun, in a gentle and approachable way. It made video games accessible to those of us in the mid-2000s whose inner nerds waited patiently just beneath the surface. For that reason, Mario Superstar Baseball is more than a nostalgia trip. It's a connector that encourages players old and new to come out of their shells (blue, red, green, or otherwise) and explore the colourful world of games.</p>

<p>When you isolate its core mechanics, Mario Superstar Baseball is pretty close to a rhythm game. Fielding is mostly automated, outside of a few button presses and the option to control players as they race to get underneath pop flies. Thus, the overwhelming majority of gameplay is spent performing baseball’s two other essential functions: pitching and batting.</p>
<p>To pitch, you aim over the plate with the sticks before holding and releasing the 'A' button on time with your character’s specific pitch motion. Part of the game’s nuance is perfecting the timing of these motions across different characters while learning the little tricks that come along with tossing change-ups, curveballs, and special pitches that make use of your character’s “Star Power.” Pro tip: Even though Kamek doesn’t come to mind off the bat as a dominant athlete among the roster of Mario characters included, this Magikoopa’s change-ups rank among the most brutal salvos the game has to offer. Have a go – you’ll be impossible to hit in no time.</p>

<p>Batting, on the other hand, is all about subtle choices. Beginners will charge up their swings by holding 'A' before each pitch, but doing so can throw off your timing, especially on fast balls. What’s more, a lot of skill-based characters, like Daisy and Luigi, are optimised around getting on base with a single button tap at the right time rather than hitting home runs with a supercharged cut at the ball.</p>
<p>Therefore, mastering the art of the bat also requires getting to know each character in your lineup. Knowing how to react when it's Shy Guy’s turn in the order versus a power hitter like Bowser or Donkey Kong constitutes a large part of Mario Superstar Baseball’s catalytic joy. Each character’s play style matches their personality and special traits.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> titles might get all the hype these days, especially in this new era of the Switch 2, Mario Superstar Baseball should not be forgotten, as it is a key example of what Nintendo wants to do with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-sports-games-of-all-time">Mario Sports</a> titles. That is, to provide a whimsical on-ramp for new fans to access the joys of the franchise while staying true enough to its roots to delight even those disciples that have enjoyed Mario since the Jump Man days. If you’re ever looking for more blasts from the past in this same vein, have a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a> for the DS (<strong>Mario Slam Basketball</strong> in Europe). Oddly enough, it was developed in collaboration with Square Enix and thus features characters from the Mushroom Kingdom competing against mainstays from the Final Fantasy franchise. A true handheld treat!</p>

<p>Speaking of handhelds, now that the Switch 2 has hit store shelves, Nintendo has managed to reclaim the video game industry spotlight. Every time they release a new console, I can’t help but think back to my favorite hardware from the Nintendo canon – and that frosty night back in 2005, just before New Year’s, when I crawled out of bed and braved the pitch darkness so that I could play a few more delightful innings with Mario and friends.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo and the gaming world at large appear to have all but moved on from Mario Superstar Baseball — especially since the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Super Sluggers</a> for the Wii and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_sports_superstars">Mario Sports Superstars</a> for the 3DS — it’s essential to look back at what makes this game and its quirky little cube-shaped console special as we move into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>While I hope Nintendo does continue to innovate, I also enjoy keeping the lamp lit for less heralded titles from its past that have made a difference larger than the sum of their parts, mediocre reviews and all. Mario Superstar Baseball is one such title, and a reboot in this era of gaming could have the potential to bring us all back to a simpler time. A time when twangy harmonica music played us into a pristine cutscene of Mario making an athletic play at his home stadium, finding a flyer from Bowser challenging his crew for the title of best baseball team in town, and questing from ballpark to ballpark all in the name of good fun and weird minigames. With nothing on the line that a secret midnight foray into the family room couldn’t fix.</p>

<p>'That'll do'</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Belkin Charging Case - front" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce52d06607d4e/belkin-charging-case-front.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sasha Stowe</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there’s one thing that’s more important than keeping your Switch 2 charged when you’re out and about, it’s a solid, reliable case to keep it safe from harm. If you imagine that you could bring those two worlds together, you’d probably be imagining something very similar to Belkin’s Charging Case.</p>
<p>A firm, robust outside only betrays its party trick by nature of being decidedly thicker than most cases. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but sadly the use of that space isn’t exactly perfect.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the positives first, though. Underneath where your console sits is a 10,000 mAh (or 20Wh if you prefer - and you should) battery that nestles itself snugly and still with a short, velcro-fastened strap. On the top side you’ll have the classic screen flap and elasticated game card holders, a mesh pouch with a pleasing lack of any metal to damage your screen, and even a smaller pouch within for housing an Apple AirTag or similar.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, things don’t look quite so rosy once you put your console in its place. The fit is just not as good as I would expect from a company like Belkin. The console can fairly freely rock left and right, seemingly due to a combination of the battery acting as a fulcrum and the immense amount of empty space beneath each Joy-Con. There are some lips that should help stop this from happening, but they’re just not enough to prevent it.</p>
<p>Having said that, it does appear that the console is secure once everything’s closed up, but it doesn’t fill us with confidence, especially given the not-insubstantial $69.99 price tag. I really like the case’s ideas, but I do think the execution is less than ideal.</p>
<p>A bit of a rethink and a redesign with a slimmer battery that wouldn’t be so inefficient with space and this could be a serious contender.</p>

<p>Before we find out what we're all up to, however, let's see what's been going on this week. First up, of course, Nintendo released the wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> to widespread critical acclaim, including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10 review</a> from us.</p>
<p>We also found out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-announces-first-cast-members-for-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">who will be playing Link and Zelda</a> in the upcoming <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> movie, while Square Enix sadly confirmed that there will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">no upgrade path</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> from Switch 1 to Switch 2.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, Sega confirmed that its physical edition for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/sonic-racing-crossworlds-on-switch-2-will-feature-the-full-base-game-on-cartridge">feature the full base game on a 64GB cartridge</a> - huzzah!</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>The plan? The plan is to get Donkey Kong Bananza and never put it down.</p>
<p>The reality? I'll probably put off buying it and instead sink another 10 hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
<p>It's a tough life.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend im gonna be joining everyone else in exploring the latest Donkey Kong adventure.</p>
<p>I've only managed about three hours or thereabouts so far, and Im already in danger of spending way too much time just destroying the entire environments. Just because I can.</p>
<p>I will actually be making time for a few other Switch cuts this weekend, too, with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> already on my homescreen and awaiting my attention.</p>
<p>Have a good one, shorts fans!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>As predicted, everyone has gone a little bananas this weekend and yours truly is no exception. However I fear I will take far longer than any of my peers to complete Donkey Kong Bananza because I make sure that I smash every single thing that can be smashed before moving on… (Please send help!)</p>
<p>A double dose of shmup action on the way, courtesy of <a href="https://ng.dev/">NG.DEV</a>. Picked up both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvein">Gunvein</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_striker_ex">Fast Striker EX</a> so I can try to keep my reflexes at acceptable levels because I want to make sure I continue to be “old school” and not just plain old.</p>
<p>While I continue to make steady progress in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Directors Cut</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>, an inexplicable need to return to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_4">Tekken 4</a> on PlayStation 2 also needed to be inserted onto the weekend rotation. So, like… <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a> on Switch 2 when, Namco? Asking for a friend.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend is largely dedicated to [REDACTED REVIEW GAME], but if I have any time, I'll also be trying to wrap up 100 days in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a>.</p>
<p>I also checked out a game the other day called <strong>corru.observer</strong> (link: <a href="https://corru.observer/">https://corru.observer/</a>) — it's this strange, funky little sci-fi game about exploring the remnants of an alien's memories. It's all fractured and corrupted and pixel-bashy, with this fantastic layer of "translation" — the alien language is being fed to you through some kind of Star Trekky auto-translator, and every now and again it'll remind you of this by saying that a word has "no equivalent" but that it's chosen something similar, and provided context. As someone with a background in translation, I think that's super neat! I'll admit that the game takes a while to wrap your head around, especially because the UI is all in-fiction, but I think it's a real treat for anyone who enjoys games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paradise_killer">Paradise Killer</a>.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, this is a creator tool mode you can access before entering the main game, and it allows you to use the Switch 2's mouse controls to carve out, smoothen, paint, and sculpt works of art.</p>

<p>As more players have now had some time to check out the new game, more creations are being shared online. So, here's a quick look at some of the creative designs DK fans are going bananas for right now.</p>
<p>Many of these designs are doing the rounds on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/">Donkey Kong subreddit</a> as well as social media. First up, we've got a cat:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4pltmoy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Next is Leo Luster – a throwback to the <a href="https://donkeykong.fandom.com/wiki/Leo_Luster">Donkey Kong Country TV Show</a>:</p>

<p>For anyone calling for more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, tell us what you think of this recreation:</p>

<p>Mario's brother Luigi might not be in the new DK outing, but he's still there in spirit:</p>

<p>And how about this classic recreation of DK:</p>

<p>That's just a small sample of the sculptures so far, and it's still early days, so we're sure there'll be plenty of other amazing creations going forward. You can see our full thoughts about this particular mode in our Donkey Kong Bananza review (<em>spoiler: we didn't mind it</em>).</p>

<p>A new update for the mobile entry is on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Although we've been racing around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the past month, there's actually been some activity in the Nintendo mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>.</p>
<p>The game's Pipe Tour is currently back for its second run, and now in another update, Nintendo has announced it will be celebrating the arrival of the Switch 2 game with four new karts as well as some familiar themed outfits for Mario and Luigi.</p>
<p>This Mario Kart World "special campaign" is taking place exclusively in Mario Kart Tour, and is also part of the Sunshine Tour which will run from 23rd July 2025 until 6th August 2025.</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-datamine-suggests-nintendo-isnt-done-with-mario-karts-mobile-entry-just-yet">a rumour in May</a> that Mario Kart Tour would be receiving new content to celebrate Mario Kart World's release.</p>
<p>In some related news, Nintendo has also <a href="https://x.com/SuperMarioRunJP/status/1945741894694416456">announced a new event</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, where you can unlock themed statues to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. This event runs from now until 28th August 2025.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, we've been finding out more details about the developers behind the Switch 2's launch line up of games, and now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio has updated its website with two major projects.</p>
<p>It helped out with not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> but also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. It previously supported Nintendo EPD on projects like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and assisted with multiple other entries in the Mario series during the same generation. You can see the rest of the company's history <a href="https://1-up-studio.jp/company/history.html">on its official website</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4pltmoy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>According to 1UP's website, its responsibilities on Donkey Kong Bananza included "design, level design, programming" and "part of the sound". As for Mario Kart World, it's mentioned how it assisted with "part of the design". As with many major first-party Nintendo titles nowadays, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/xenoblade_studio_monolith_soft_is_helping_make_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">collaborative efforts like this</a> have become increasingly common.</p>
<p>This follows an update from Nintendo earlier this month, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">"the Super Mario Odyssey team"</a> developed DK and Pauline's latest outing for the Switch 2. We've also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-the-voice-actors-behind-dk-and-pauline">confirmation of the voice actors</a> involved in this new entry.</p>

<p>Now arriving this November</p>

<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b78ba65d5ed0/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>After multiple delays, Level-5 has announced it will be delaying its upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> again.</p>
<p>Instead of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-finally-has-release-date-out-on-switch-2-day-one">previous August release date</a>, it's now been pushed back to <strong>13th November 2025</strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms. The latest delay is apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". Here's the scoop, via the game's <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1946252039518044194">official social media account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Announcement Regarding the Release Date</strong></p>
<p>Due to the content volume exceeding our initial expectations, additional time is required for voice recording, multi-language localization, and other related processes. As we work toward the final stages of development, we have decided to adjust the release date to ensure the best possible quality.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<div><p>The release date of "Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road" has been changed from August 21, 2025, to [November 13, 2025 (GMT)].</p><p>

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all the fans who have been eagerly waiting for a long time, and truly appreciate your understanding and continued support.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the video below detailing this delay and it also reiterates how development is apparently in the "final stages". The team believes this next date is when it will "finally be able to release the game".</p>
<p>The same video also highlights the development progress and improved features players can expect when this title does finally arrive. The team does not want to make any compromises and intends to use the extra time to further polish and enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>This delay follows Level-5's launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which got off to a positive start in its opening months – surpassing 1.2 million in "global cumulative sales".</p>
