<p>Kirby! Mario Kart! Deltarune!</p>

<p>The magic of Game Builder Garage lives on Nintendo Switch 2. As one of a handful of games to receive a free update for the new console — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-all-mouse-mode-compatible-games">including Mouse Mode compatibility</a> — fans are continuing to develop weird and wonderful creations in the game.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/game-builder-garage-fan-made-direct-reveals-multiple-amazing-new-creations-alongside-switch-2-update">with the recent Game Builder Garage 'Direct'</a>, we thought now was the perfect time to dive back into the game and check out what you lovely folks have been making.</p>
<p>Zion took the plunge and got to spend time with a handful of delights, including a 3D Kirby game, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>-inspired platformer, a <strong>Mario Kart</strong> game, and plenty of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> references.</p>
<p>If you're curious, check out the video up top to see Zion's experiences with these creations, and let us know if you've tried any of these out — or have any cool GBG games to share with us — in the comments.</p>

<p>NS2 Edition Hyper Partying Redux Deluxe ++</p>

<figure><a title="Jamboree TV" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/741ab0351e614/jamboree-tv.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>With Donkey Kong still basking in the limelight a couple of weeks after the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> launched, you might have missed Nintendo's second first-party Switch 2 release to hit the eShop in as many weeks. Sure, it's more of an addendum to 2024's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, but we consider the original the best entry in the entire series, and Jamboree TV only adds cherries on top of that cake.</p>
<p>PJ gave the updated game a sparkling 9/10 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">in his review</a> last week. In fact, the silly title is pretty much the only thing we're not quite on board with. We would have loved to hear the folks on the old Nintendo Power podcast saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>" <em>every single time</em> it's mentioned. Rumours that the unwieldy NS2 Edition names are the reason they stopped the 'cast are entirely spurious. Probably.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2/critic-reviews/">"Generally Favorable" Metascore of 78</a>, so not everybody enjoyed it <em>quite</em> as much as PJ - and we're keen to hear what you think.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten around to it just yet (hey, we get it, it's been a busy — and <em>expensive</em> — couple of months!), no sweat. Remember, you can come back at any time and score the game from 1-10 as you see fit, either here on Jamboree TV's game page, and it'll count towards the poll.</p>
<p>If you've already rated the game in our database, you're a <em>particularly</em> lovely person and we salute you. If not, we still think you're lovely - feel free to drop your mark below. You know, if you like.</p>
