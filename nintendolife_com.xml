<p>Maika Monroe fans, unite</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has released a new live-action short as part of its marketing campaign for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, and it's a banger.</p>
<p>Starring Maika Monroe (<strong>It Follows</strong>, <strong>Longlegs</strong>) as a doting mother caught in the midst of the Raccoon City outbreak, the short effortlessly captures the frantic panic that ensues when the iconic location is overrun by zombies and BOWs.</p>
<p>Toward the end (<strong>spoiler alert if you want to watch it blind</strong>), we see a lonely figure shuffle through the ruined remains of Raccoon City, a photo clutched in her hand as she stops at what seems to be a grave made for a child. Yes, it's Monroe's character, but she's been zombified. A bullet from an unseen shooter takes her out before the following dialogue sounds out over radio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That's the last of 'em. Facility secured."</p>
<p>"Copy that. Raccoon City is ours."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following on-screen message then reads "Evil has always had a face". Intriguing, no?</p>
<p>It's a pretty impressive advertisement for the game; one that comes close to the surprisingly emotional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg">Dead Island trailer</a> from way back when. We know, of course, that the undead featured in Requiem have some remnants of their personalities intact, so we assume this is why the mother is visiting her daughter's grave as a zombie.</p>
<p>Kudos to Capcom for bagging Monroe for the lead too; she's well-loved around these parts for her roles in the horror genre.</p>
<p>We won't have to wait long to see what happens in Requiem. The latest mainline Resident Evil entry launches on the Switch 2 later this month on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Presented in an "RPG-like fashion", naturally</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="0f68a75aaf501"><a title="Yuji Horii Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f68a75aaf501/yuji-horii-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=mare07-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Shogakukan</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Masahiro Sakurai's game knowledge was extended to yet another medium when the game developer extraordinaire's life was translated into a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sakurai-is-getting-his-very-own-manga-biography">manga biography</a>. Why do we bring this up now, you might ask? Well, because <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> creator Yuji Horii will soon get the same treatment (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/manga-detailing-the-life-of-dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-in-educational-rpg-style-to-release-on-february-24/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Unofficially titled '<strong>Dragon Quest Creator Yuji Horii: New Educational Manga Biography</strong>' (translated by Automaton), the manga is supposedly a semi-dramatised retelling of the developer's life, predominantly focusing on his Dragon Quest work — no surprises there, then. Its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=nlife0b-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon listing</a> even suggests that it'll frame the story as an RPG itself, with Horii-san recruiting people to his 'party' and 'levelling up' with new skills.</p>
<p>The manga is being published by Shogakukan, with illustrations by Iori Makoto, and it'll feature an interview with Horii-san himself at the end. While no official English translation has been announced at the time of writing, the book is set to launch in Japan on <strong>24th February</strong> for 1,210 yen (roughly £6/$8).</p>
<p>We can't take a peek at the manga's contents just yet, but here's a closer look at the cover art:</p>
<figure data-uuid="dc61910ccbb0e"><a title="Yuji Horii Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc61910ccbb0e/yuji-horii-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=mare07-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Shogakukan</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This will be the latest game developer to join Shogakukan's biography series. Back in 2018, the publisher released a similar deep dive on Pokémon's Satoshi Tajiri, all about the founding of <em>another</em> hugely popular RPG series. Who will be next, we wonder?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I’d like to talk about Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>It has received high ratings, scoring over 80 on Metascore at “Metacritic” and earning an "Overwhelmingly Positive*1" rating on Steam's customer reviews. We recently announced that worldwide cumulative sales have surpassed 1 million units. However, initial performance did not meet our expectations, and we are aiming to sell approximately another 1 million units within this fiscal year. We aim to sustain long-term sales by encouraging players to enjoy the game over time through the continued support of the title including ongoing release of additional downloadable content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega notes that its overall performance in the first half of the current fiscal year has been somewhat disappointing, citing lower-than-expected sales in the gaming division along with Rovio's performance in the entertainment sector.</p>
<p>The presentation highlights <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</a> as a major full game release for the fiscal year, but we suspect it will probably want a few more big-hitters as the wider industry grapples with uncertain economies and price hikes across the board.</p>
