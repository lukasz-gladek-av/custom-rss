<p>In its Autumn decorations, the government has awarded Horii the Order of the Rising Sun 4th Class: Gold Rays with Rosette, one of the country's highest honours. The only awards higher than this are the Order of the Chrysanthemum, and Order of the Paulownia Flowers, both of which are generally reserved for monarchs, prime ministers, senior statesmen, etc.</p><div><figure data-videoid="GReZx3uoZNA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytGReZx3uoZNA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed640b4esmnvhy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Horii is the first video game designer to receive such an award, yet he seemingly remains as humble as ever with his accompanying comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been making games for a long time, about 40 years now, but it’s not just my own efforts, it’s all thanks to the staff who helped me make it, and the users who have always supported me. I’ve levelled up in many ways, done many things, and all my hard work has paid off.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latest entry to the series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, just recently launched on the Switch and Switch 2 and is likely to be a monumental success over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Horii is also busy at work on the next mainline entry, <strong>Dragon Quest XII</strong>, which has still yet to receive a firm update or release date since its initial announcement.</p>

<p>"It looks so good, it runs so well"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Digital Extremes has been teasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a>'s Switch 2 version for a few weeks now, and in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KJqHXg1RkUg?t=1235s">devstream</a>, the studio revealed that we shouldn't have long to wait before we can get our hands on it.</p>
<p>Accompanied by yet more footage of the game in action, Digital Extremes announced that the Switch 2 native build of Warframe will arrive at some point in <strong>2026</strong>. There are no specifics outside of that initial window, we should add, though the team stated that they'll be releasing it "as early as we possibly can in the new year".</p>
<p>The fresh footage showed the game running in handheld on Switch 2 with DLSS enabled, and we have to say, it looks pretty solid. This is still a dev build, but it gives a good indication of load times and how things will fare in close-combat.</p>
<p>This is the second slice of Warframe Switch 2 gameplay that we've seen from Digital Extremes in recent weeks, but this one is made all the sweeter by the thought that we'll soon be able to play it ourselves (<em>hopefully</em>).</p>

<figure data-uuid="6caa500d37d4a"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6caa500d37d4a/yakuza-kiwami-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are expanding the <strong>Yakuza / Like A Dragon</strong> franchise on the Switch 2 with the upcoming releases of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami 2</a>, and thanks to updated store pages on the eShop, we now have the file sizes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, neither game comes close to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, which takes up a whopping <strong>45.3GB</strong>, but if you're looking to purchase both, then you'll still need a fair bit of storage.</p>
<p>Yakuza: Kiwami will take up <strong>20.2GB</strong>, while Kiwami 2 will take up <strong>28.1GB</strong>. The former is slightly smaller than its OG Switch counterpart, which came in at <strong>22.9GB</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SPNmJfiTiVg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SPNmJfiTiVg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSPNmJfiTiVg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SPNmJfiTiVg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SPNmJfiTiVg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4adf68hmnpvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Meanwhile, we already have a view of how large <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> will be when it launches on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>. This will be the largest yet at <strong>46GB</strong>, which isn't entirely surprising considering it'll be utilising the latest Dragon Engine technology alongside a substantial slice of brand-new content.</p>
<p>Kiwami 2 also made use of the Dragon Engine, and was the first remake to do so after the technology was introduced in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/yakuza_6_the_song_of_life">Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</a> in 2016. So expect slightly fancier visuals with this one on Switch 2 when compared to Yakuza 0 and Kiwami.</p>
<p>Kiwami and Kiwami 2 will both launch on <strong>13th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Series' 30th anniversary looms</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="30a0495948c20"><a title="Lady D" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30a0495948c20/lady-d.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1984834530994508196">has announced a new collaboration</a> between <strong>Resident Evil</strong> and Japanese metal group <strong>BABYMETAL</strong>, but its debut has fans divided on the franchise's apparent obsession with Lady Dimitrescu.</p>
<p>The collaboration will result in some special Resident Evil / BABYMETAL merchandise landing in 2026, presumably to directly coincide with the series' 30th anniversary on <strong>22nd March</strong>. However, the inclusion of Dimitrescu – a relatively minor antagonist from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> – has got fans wondering why Capcom isn't focusing more on legacy characters like Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield.</p>
<p>Fans are voicing their concerns over on social media, with <a href="https://x.com/SonnyBauer8462" tabindex="-1">@SonnyBauer8462</a> stating "I feel like Jill/Chris would be more befitting":</p>


<p>Of course, it's pretty clear to us why Dimitrescu is being utilised so much for marketing purposes at the moment. The character was the true standout star of Resident Evil: Village (which, don't forget, is getting a fresh Switch 2 release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a>), and the performance from voice actor Maggie Robertson remains iconic to this day.</p>

<p>Robertson also provided an overview of the franchise as part of Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQODLCylKbM">'Road to Requiem'</a> video posted last week. During the almost 11-minute presentation, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">it was announced</a> that a new themed Pro Controller would be released for the Switch 2, alongside a Grace Ashcroft amiibo in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>So yeah, we're pretty torn over Capcom's focus on Lady Dimitrescu. On the one hand, yes, the character is excellent and we imagine the company is probably busy conjuring up some sort of spin-off game for her at this very moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Resident Evil has always been known for the events of Raccoon City – even 30 years later – and it's perhaps a bit odd that not more focus is being put on the characters that started it all. Especially when you consider that we'll be revisiting the scorched remains of the city in Resident Evil Requiem in 2026.</p>
