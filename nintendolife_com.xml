<p>Just a little longer now...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Whilst we already knew that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, an upcoming battle-focused game for Switch and mobile platforms, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/pokemon-champions-a-new-battle-focused-game-announced-for-switch-and-mobile">was a thing that is happening</a>, extra details have been fairly thin on the ground this far, including when we'll actually get our hands on the game.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a brand new gameplay trailer which was just shown during the latest Pokémon Presents, we have some more info to dig into, most important of which, perhaps, is that the game won't arrive until <strong>2026</strong>. There's no further info on exactly when we can expect a drop, but this is a little longer than we'd expected, given that we've known about the new entry for a little while now.</p>
<p>Outside of a narrowing down of the release window, we also learned a few more positive things about the game itself, including its compatibility with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> - allowing you to transfer your collection of critters from other games into Champions.</p>
<p>You'll be able to fight in Ranked, Casual, or Private Battles and recruit Pokémon to your team using Victory Points.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for yourself above, it's certainly looking action-packed we have to say, and the inclusion of the ability to recruit in-game Pokémon to use in 1v1 and 2v2 battles sounds rather neat indeed.</p>

<p>Lookin' Mega</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Surprising absolutely no one, today's Pokémon Presents showcase left us with yet another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with a lengthy trailer detailing the game's story, side missions and new Mega Evolutions. And yes, there was more than a little Dragonite thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Let's start with that delightful dragon, shall we? The trailer brought us our first proper look at Mega Dragonite, which sports several "Dragonair-like features" — wings on the head, a pearl on the tail, you know the drill. We can't say that we're completely sold on the design, but more Dragonite is always a good thing.</p>
<p>You'll need to rely on newbies like this one to tackle the rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon that are springing up across Lumiose City at their own accord. The trailer gives a closer look at that Xenoblade-style combat that we were so interested in after the reveal, and yep, it still looks cool.</p>


<p>For those who weren't watching the presentation live, TPC split the Legends: Z-A section into two trailers, so you can check out the other half below to find out what the game's story will have in store.</p>

<p>If all of that takes your fancy but you haven't picked up a Switch 2 yet (and you don't want to face the Switch 1 version), Nintendo has revealed that a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-its-very-own-switch-2-bundle">Legends: Z-A Switch 2 bundle</a> will be launching alongside the game on <strong>16th October</strong>.</p>

<p>Titled 'The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Aardman Animation has officially lifted the lid on its upcoming collaboration with Pokémon — and, as you'd expect, it's a TV series.</p>
<p>In today's Pokémon Presents, we got our first look at <strong>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu</strong>, a stop-motion animated series that is set in "a region Trainers have explored before—one that is very close to Aardman’s heart." Weeeeell... that sounds like Galar, doesn't it?</p>
<p>The teaser doesn't show much, though we think Wooloo could give Shaun the Sheep a run for his money here. You can also spot the little Pichu's ears and Sirfetch'd's distinctive leek sword and shield.</p>
<p>The show isn't due to air until 2027, but we're already grabbing the cheese and crackers.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the teaser in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>To be clear, no, this isn't a special edition Switch 2 — the console itself is exactly the same — but it will likely pose a cheaper way to pick up the new hybrid <em>and</em> Pokémon game together.</p>
