<p>Thought Nintendo had forgotten about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>? Think again! December's big release has just landed a brand-new trailer titled 'Survive' and, expectedly, it's still looking awesome.</p>
<p>Now, the trailer itself is only a little over a minute long, and you will have seen a lot of the footage before, but there are still some brief new snippets for those who have been going through every previous reveal with a fine-tooth comb.</p>
<p>We get a glimpse at some cool-looking psychic platforms, mysterious jungle vehicles, cutscene dogfights and more of that open desert area that we know we'll be speeding around on Vi-O-La. There's also a slightly different look at a fight with a pack of wolves, plenty of dramatic locales and Samus doing yet another <strong>Akira</strong> slide — because we can never get enough of <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>In short, things are still being kept pretty securely under wraps — hey, it's not like the game comes out <em>one month today</em> or anything... What we do know is that the long-awaited adventure is looking mighty fine. Let's just keep those fingers crossed that it can live up to the anticipation.</p>

As reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-patent-office-boss-orders-reexamination-of-nintendos-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-which-ip-lawyer-claims-further-undermines-credibility-of-its-case-against-palworld">IGN</a>), the U.S. Patent Office boss John Squires (no, not quite The Stone Roses guitarist - close, though) has ordered the reexamination of Nintendo's “summon sub-character and let it fight” patent.</p>
<p>The patent was previously granted "without any objection" to Nintendo, though Squires points to two previous patents from Konami in 2002 and Nintendo itself in 2019 which may viewed as "prior art" references. Squires says that both are “important in deciding whether the claims are patentable,” while each “raises a substantial new question of patentability".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fylguht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>It's important to note that the reexamination doesn't necessarily mean that the patent will ultimately be rejected, but Games Fray writer Florian Mueller says that this is now "highly likely" given the circumstances. Mueller also says that the very nature of the reexamination "further undermines the credibility" of Nintendo's patent.</p>
<p>As for why this has occurred, Mueller surmises that it's likely a direct result of the public outrage that followed when news broke of Nintendo's patent submission. The article argues that "No system is perfect, which is why there must be processes in place to fix issues".</p>
<p>Mueller closes by stating that there will likely be no further developments in Nintendo's case against Palworld nor any of the patents that relate to it in this calendar year. Decisions will likely be made in 2026, however, particularly by Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima, who leads the patent division of the Tokyo District Court. Mueller states that, given all of the developments relating to this case, "It is ever more likely that Nintendo will lose".</p>
<p>Nintendo had recently been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendos-pokemon-catching-related-patent-has-been-rejected-in-japan">dealt another legal blow</a> when its patent related to catching <strong>Pokémon</strong> was rejected in Japan due to lacking an "inventive step", and that "the claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field".</p>
<p>Things may still sway in Nintendo's favour, but to say that this legal battle has been much more compelling than any of us has expected would be an understatement. We'll be keen to see how things shake out in the months to come.</p>

The release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/awesome-roguelike-astral-ascent-doubles-in-size-with-ver-2-0-launch-and-new-dlc">ver. 2.0 update and 'Outer Reaches' DLC</a> mean the game is almost twice as big as it was to begin with, and it will soon be getting even bigger... and cuter.</p>
<p>That's because the dev has revealed a new DLC, 'Celestial Haven', which will be coming to Steam later this month, with a Switch release following "shortly after", and it is packed (we mean <em>packed</em>) with adorable little pets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wnuilh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Celestial Haven adds a brand-new 'Shelter' area to the game's hub world, where you can house a troop of cute little critters to assist you on your runs. There are cat-like Lupo, doggy Vulpo, chinchilla-esque Pantero, and mythical Grifo and Draketo, all of whom will dig up rewards as you play and cheer you on whenever you level up.</p>
<p>We know you're thinking it too, and yes, you can pet all of them in the Shelter. <em>Thank god</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC will be listed for a minimum price of <strong>$1.99</strong> on Steam, with all proceeds going to the French animal charity <a href="https://one-voice.fr/en/">One Voice</a>. Come on, there's something particularly sweet about protecting both virtual <em>and</em> real animals, right?</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screenshots and the official DLC rundown from the Celestial Haven <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4116520/Astral_Ascent__Celestial_Haven/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Celestial Haven DLC</strong> creates a cozy new spot in main hub where your lovely companions will get together, play and rest.</p>
<p>But they're not just cute: they're valuable companions you can bring along on your explorations. They’ll assist you during the runs by using its instincts to sniff out and dig up special rewards across the rooms. As good pets, they’ll follow you everywhere and celebrate your victories — from defeating a tough Zodiac to perfecting a room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We had a wonderful time with Astral Ascent when it launched on Switch a few years back, calling it "probably the best roguelike since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/astral-ascent">our review</a>. Throw in some pettable animals for good measure, and we'd say you're onto a winner.</p>
