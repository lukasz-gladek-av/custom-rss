<p>Instead, there may be "a new series on a different line"</p>

<figure data-uuid="9342ae3b609b1"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9342ae3b609b1/yakuza-kiwami-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside continuing the stories of Kazuma Kiryu and introducing the world to Ichiban Kasuga, Sega and RGG Studio has spent about a decade bringing back some of the older <strong>Yakuza / Like A Dragon</strong> games for modern audiences. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>, out on 12th February, is the latest of those remakes, following on (naturally) from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a>. But it sounds like, rather than moving onto the fourth game, the end of the Kiwami series is here (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/no-more-yakuza-kiwami-games-after-kiwami-3-story-changes-new-series-could-happen">Push Square</a>!).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wCglSfda04">Ryusta TV livestream</a> broadcast earlier today, RGG Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama said that "I think 'Yakuza Kiwami 3' will be the last one, and the 'Kiwami line will come to an end." (translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1r17x0o/yokoyama_announced_kiwami_3_will_the_last_game_in/">u/Dastanovich on Reddit</a>.)</p><div><figure data-videoid="MWHW8NC1uMo" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytMWHW8NC1uMo" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8af228gykinw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Of course, that's far from the end of the Yakuza — after all, we need more Ichiban in our lives (especially on Switch 2) — and Yokoyama elaborates that "I don't think it'll continue as the 'Kiwami' series anymore. I think a different series will begin. And not something like 'Like a Dragon 9,' but rather a new series on a different line, with a different meaning."</p>
<p>This sort of sounds like new timeline stuff, but it also means that Yakuza 4, Yakuza 5, and Yakuza 6 will be skipping the remake treatment — presumably. But with Yakuza Kiwami 3 reportedly making some controversial cuts and changes to the game's story, there's perhaps too much friction between the Kiwami games and the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Yokoyama seems to suggest that's the case, as he says the decision to stop the Kiwami games "... might be something you'll understand once you play 'Yakuza Kiwami 3.'"</p>
<p>Reviews for the upcoming remake have been more on the mixed side than Yakuza is used to. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">We scored it a 6/10 on Switch 2</a>, for example, with our own Ollie Reynolds calling it "a fair series entry, but one that's tainted by poor pacing and a recasting controversy that simply didn't need to happen."</p>
<p>So, what's next for Yakuza / Like A Dragon? A break? The next game? RGG <em>is</em> also working on a brand new IP, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stranger_than_heaven">Stranger Than Heaven</a>, and appears to be unrelated to RGG's premier franchise.</p>

<p>Still coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><em>Are</em>Fans are still speculating as to what exactly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/danganronpa-2x2">Danganronpa 2x2</a> is — part a remaster and rerelease of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_2_goodbye_despair_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa 2</a>, part a brand new scenario, the game is largely shrouded in mystery. But while we wait for more info (and a firmer 2026 release date), Spike Chunsoft has opened up pre-orders for the physical release of the game.</p>
<p>On both Switch 1 and Switch 2, Danganronpa 2x2 will be getting a standard physical release — stocked at various retailers for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> — which appears to include the game fully on the card for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Plus. there's a special collector's edition, appropriately-named the 'Psycho Tropical Vacation Package'. This will set you back <strong>$139.99 USD</strong> and includes a RSVLTS reversible Psycho Tropical hat, a Kidrobot 3" figure of bother tropical Monokuma and Monomi, an OST which includes remixes of the best tracks from the original game, and a clamshell-style outer box to display your collection in.</p>
<p>In addition, if you pre-order directly from <a href="https://store.spike-chunsoft.com/">Spike Chunsoft</a>'s Shopify page, you'll get a 4" Monokuma Flight Tag.</p>
<figure data-uuid="aee2552de968a"><a title="Danganronpa 2x2 Psycho Tropical Vacation Package" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aee2552de968a/danganronpa-2x2-psycho-tropical-vacation-package.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spike Chunsoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Canadian store <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/products/danganronpa-2x2-standard-edition-nintendo-switrch-pre-order?bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP</a> has also opened up pre-orders for the game for <strong>$84.99 CAD</strong> (or <strong>$194.99 CAD</strong> for the special edition). European European orders will be handled by Reef Entertainment.</p>
<p>We haven't seen much of Danganronpa 2x2 since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">its reveal at the September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, though it was shown off at the Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Fes: Ultimate Appreciation Festival back in November.</p>
<p>The "all new storyline" being added to this rerelease is reportedly meant to be as long as the base game, which means double the content. And probably double the shenanigans. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_v3_killing_harmony_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa V3</a>, anything is possible...</p>
