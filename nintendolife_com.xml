<figure data-uuid="9213102ac3a22"><a title="Rayman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9213102ac3a22/rayman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although Ubisoft has only just done a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a>, it's already been confirmed the mascot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Rayman</a> is part of the company's future plans.</p>
<p>Now, following a rating for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/surprise-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated"><strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong></a> last month, the series creator Michel Ancel has made some comments about a new project to <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/uk/retro-gamer-subscription/dp/fe2efd7d">Retro Gamer Magazine</a>, which would apparently see the return of the first Rayman game.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say, as highlighted by GamesRadar+ and some Rayman fans on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think there's a kind of remake planned. I don't remember when specifically, but it will be in HD and I think Ubisoft is adding a few more checkpoints and things like that just to make it a bit less frustrating. I think it's a nice move, because that's the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6ltxhuk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>So, it really does look like this supposed revival is based on the first 2D Rayman game, which originally launched on the PlayStation in 1995. As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/rumoured-rayman-ps5-remaster-is-real-says-series-creator">colleagues at Push Square</a> further note, it <em>sounds</em> "like an enhanced remaster" timed with the original game's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">reports from last September</a> about a Rayman Remake being in development. Of course, we don't have an official confirmation just yet, but the evidence is mounting.</p>

<p>See how it holds up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>There have been a bunch of demos released following last week's Partner Showcase, and one of them was for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/yKHAcYtToz8">YouTube channel 'ElAnalistaDeBits'</a> has now shared a side-by-side of this demo to showcase how the Switch 2 performance and resolution compares to the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5 versions. The resolution is the lowest on the hybrid platform, and the uncapped frame rate hovers around 30fps.</p>
<p>The same video notes how the Switch 2 version shows "greater stability than the Xbox Series S version in docked mode" but in "portable mode it can fall below 30fps more often".</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this demo may not necessarily be 100% reflective of the final release in terms of the game's graphics, performance and gameplay, and is subject to change.</p>
<p>Once again, the Switch 2 trial demo for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is available to download right now from the eShop. Capcom has also confirmed you'll be able to transfer your save data to the full game when it arrives on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We should also have our own preview of this title up on Nintendo Life soon, so be on the lookout for that!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:197147,197251 @ 1770708088 -->

<p>But will it translate to sales?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="77fee97d0cb5e"><a title="Pragmata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77fee97d0cb5e/pragmata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last week, Capcom <em>finally</em> released the demo for its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2, allowing users to shoot and hack "on-the-go" or on the big screen at home.</p>
<p>Now, following this particular version of the sci-fi action-adventure trial rolling out on the eShop, the "combined downloads" of the "Sketchbook demo" across all platforms have officially hit the one million mark. Capcom has issued a small "thank you" notice to players today via social media.</p>
<p>Whether the demo's success will translate to actual sales is obviously not clear just yet, as we're still a few months from launch, but if you want to show your support for this upcoming release, you can pre-order it now on the eShop.</p>
<p>We've also gone hands on with this title recently and are thinking it could end up being one of the biggest surprises of the year. Here's what Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All eyes are on Resident Evil Requiem for this year, but Pragmata definitely has the potential to be something really special come 24h April 2026. Unlike Kunitsu-Gami, it feels like Capcom is making a real solid attempt to create its next big IP here, and while it certainly still has much to prove – I didn’t get a whole lot of narrative context during the demo, for example – its gameplay has done more than enough to bump it up to the top tier of my ever-growing wish list."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a new week, and it means Nintendo has updated its mobile music application with another video game soundtrack. This time, it's the album from the 2020 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">Paper Mario: The Origami King</a>.</p>
<p>According to the app, <strong>263 tracks</strong> have been added and there's a runtime of more than 11 hours! Nintendo notes how the tracklist includes songs such as "Red Streamer Battle, Autumn Mountain, and more". It joins the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube album, which is already available on the app.</p>
<p>Origami King had a whole host of composers including Shoh Murakami, Yoshiaki Kimura, Hiroki Morishita and Fumihiro Isobe, and it was led by Yoshito Sekigawa (who helped compose the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube title and has also worked on multiple other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/paper_mario_color_splash">Paper Mario</a> games since then).</p>

<p>To access this album update on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app, you'll need to have an active (and paid) Switch Online membership. You can find out more about the weekly Nintendo Music updates and this particular Paper Mario game in our existing coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>If you haven't already played this entry, we gave it eight out of ten stars, calling it one of the funniest games in the series:</p>

<p>The estimates for its minute-long ad are through the roof</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon</a> banks an insane amount every year, so it can afford to splash some cash from time to time. If you are wondering how much yesterday's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/jigglypuff-is-joined-by-up-and-comer-lady-gaga-in-pokemons-super-bowl-ad">Super Bowl LX commercial</a> might have cost, according to reports, it's estimated to have required "at least $16 million" for just a single minute.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://screenrant.com/pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-budget-compared-games/">noted by ScreenRant</a>, this likely doesn't even factor in the "price of the ad itself, filming, and animating the Pokémon". And then there were mega stars such as Lady Gaga on display, who probably cost an arm and a leg to hire.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fxpuolj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>While this amount of coin might not seem like a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/super-bowl-ad-prediction-market-contracts.html">big deal in the context of the Super Bowl</a> (or modern marketing budgets), this estimate has led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1qzur3b/it_just_hit_me_that_the_cost_to_air_the_super/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemons-super-bowl-commercial-was-probably-expensive-unsurprisingly">speculation and debate</a> about how much this single ad spot might cost compared to the development costs of the mainline video game entries. Although, as mentioned by the source, these same comparisons are based on "unconfirmed leaks for the budget" of the latest game.</p>
<p>But hey, keep in mind, Pokémon seemingly remains out in front as the <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/56337-the-world-s-highest-grossing-media-franchises-revealed">highest-grossing media franchise of all-time</a>, with the series transcending the video games. And this is the 30th anniversary we're talking about here, so it's not necessarily a surprise to see The Pokémon Company spending big on the brand.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has already announced it will be celebrating this milestone anniversary in many different ways, including the release of a brand-new LEGO line later this month. Heck, TIME Magazine is even releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/time-magazine-reveals-special-edition-pokemon-30th-anniversary-covers">a special trio of Pokémon covers</a>, and we're sure we'll see some exciting announcements on Pokémon Day this year.</p>
