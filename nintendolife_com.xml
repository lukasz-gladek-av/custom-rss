Yes, it's the weekend, and we're gazing at our stack of games with wistful longing. We can't let them go unplayed, can we?</p>
<p>Before we dive into what we're booting up, however, let's take a look at the last week. Our headline review was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, but we also checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. In terms of news, we basically got another mini Direct with PlayStation's State of Play.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> was confirmed alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/castlevania_belmonts_curse">Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</a>, with a ridiculously cool trailer released for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Man, it looks <em>so</em> good...</p>
<p>It's also been announced that the incredibly average <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/jurassic_park_classic_games_collection">Jurassic Park: Classic Games Collection</a> will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/jurassic-park-classic-games-collection-to-be-delisted-just-two-years-after-release">delisted soon</a>, so if you're eager to play, then you best get it downloaded soon.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was greedy and wrapped up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> way quicker than I was expecting last weekend, so I am officially <em>Between Games TM</em> at the moment. I’ve been enjoying working my way through some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario’s Super Picross</a> on the NSO library to chill out, and I imagine this weekend will bring more of the same!</p>
<p>While I can’t really believe that I’m saying it, I’m also quite keen to check out some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overwatch">Overwatch</a> this weekend. I missed the boat when it first launched, but all of this new content has me intrigued.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This week, I have jetlag. I tried to play games that required even a little bit of brain, and it did not go well (it was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, for the record. Not even a particularly cerebral game! I'm just very tired).</p><p>

I've been making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>, as I will be for the rest of my life, and now I'm somewhere around 25 endings. Maybe more. Also, <strong>Titanium Court</strong>, which is not out yet, but I have an early code because I'm a jammy lad, and it's VERY good, so look forward to that one (although... I'm not sure if it's due out on Switch. Sorry). Also, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> (which IS out on Switch, and you should play it) and watching my partner play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a>, after a year of me going PLAY IT PLAY IT PLAY IT. So that's very fun.</p><p>

But I'm looking for something meaty to play after finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Another JRPG, perhap? Recommendations always welcome.</p></div>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I’ve not had much time to play this week as I’ve been under the weather, however I predict this weekend will be spent gaming in bed. It’s only fitting with it being Valentine’s Day on Saturday that my fiancee and I replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> together.</p>
<p>Saying that, I’m still on the mission of becoming less of a wimp and with the recent <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a> trailer, I might just jump into a horror game from my backlog. I’m sure I can dust off something from my collection. Perhaps <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_4_wii_edition">Resident Evil 4</a> on Wii? Wish me luck…I think motion controls are scarier than Las Plagas!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still completely addicted to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> at the moment, though I did briefly test out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a> after its recent update, and I can confirm that MGS2 and 3 now run like a dream on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So yes, it's likely that I'll be spending a bit of time with Solid and Naked Snake this weekend, playing their two best adventures as intended. It took a while, but Konami finally pulled through.</p>

<p>"Traverse a 3D printed Times Square-like area"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Apart from a new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, Capcom's new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> also made an appearance at PlayStation's 'State of Play' this week.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer titled 'World View' gives us another glimpse at a recreation of New York, and also adds some backstory about the game's protagonist Hugh. This trailer ends on a bit of a shocking note, with Hugh and his android companion Diana being chased by an enemy threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hugh and Diana as they traverse a 3D printed Times Square-like area, dominated by massive structures. What mysteries await them in this twisted lunar cityscape?"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already tried it out, there's a demo for Pragmata on the Switch 2 eShop that you can download right now. Capcom also announced earlier this week that this same demo has now reached one million "combined" downloads across all platforms.</p>
<p>This new hacking and shooting game will arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>24th April 2026</strong>. Will you be picking it up on release? Have you tried out the demo yet? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Pinball Machine Officially Revealed By Stern Pinball, Available Now]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-pinball-machine-officially-revealed-by-stern-pinball-available-now</link>
            <guid>1436032</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>As part of Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations, Stern Pinball has now officially revealed its new Pokémon pinball machine.</p>
<p>It's available right now in "pro", "premium" and "limited edition" models. The limited edition is "limited" to 750 units globally, and prices range between $6,999 - $12,999, depending on the model. If you're interested, or happen to be a business owner, you can <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">contact Stern on its website</a> to find out about the availability of these machines and more details.</p>

<p>This machine promises to take trainers on an "unforgettable journey" across four distinct habitats as they battle their way through rival trainers and Team Rocket. It also integrates video clips from the original animated series, including the official theme song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game begins with the player entering a random biome: forest, water, mountain, or desert. By hitting the ball at the proper targets on the board, you’ll discover, catch, and train new Pokémon partners. Occasionally, you’ll encounter the troublesome Team Rocket, and you’ll need to prevent them from capturing Pokémon during a frantic multiball sequence.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve scored enough points and completed specific activities in a biome, you’ll be able to take on a Gym Battle against a rival party of Pokémon. Complete all the biomes’ Gym Battles, and you’ll enter the Pokémon Arena. There’s even an opportunity to face off against Team Rocket’s boss, Giovanni, but only the most skilled pinball wizards are likely to make it that far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The premium and limited edition versions of the machine also feature an interactive electromagnet that "adds chaos" to the battle arena.</p>
<p>As part of the whole experience, trainers can use Stern's app to document the Pokémon they catch. Here's a bit about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Utilizing Stern Pinball’s award-winning Insider Connected, <em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball elevates the experience by connecting Trainers and their adventures across machines and locations. When Trainers play Pokémon by Stern Pinball signed in with their Stern Insider Connected Account, the Pokémon they CATCH will be added to their Insider Connected Pokémon Collection, which can be viewed in the Insider Connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're curious to see it in action, <a href="https://youtu.be/mJKxHwMiCJM">YouTube channel The Pinball Company</a> has gone hands on with the new Pokémon machine. The <a href="https://youtu.be/Z-g8SDhfWVc">YouTube channel Foxcitiespinball</a> has also uploaded a video of the Stern team explaining the new machine and the design.</p>

<p>Rovio's performance "fell significantly short of initial forecast"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8a7a553b8c1b"><a title="Sonic Angry Birds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8a7a553b8c1b/sonic-angry-birds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA Sammy has published its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Q3 2025/26 financial report</a>, and it's a pretty mixed bag for the multimedia giant, with losses reported in multiple different areas.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest piece of news comes from Rovio's side of the business. Sega acquired the Angry Bird developer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/its-official-sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio">in 2023</a> Sega reports has fallen "significantly short of initial forecast due to rapid changes in the market environment and other factors".</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_forecast_e.pdf">reported an impairment loss</a> of ¥30.4 billion ($198.6 million), citing increased competition and the rapid deterioration of user bases. This meant that "Rovio found it difficult to advance its initially planned business development".</p>
<p>A number of titles haven't met Sega's own internal targets, with development delays and cancellations also a factor. <strong>Sonic Rumble</strong>, the mobile game which Rovio co-developed, also fell short of expectations, particularly around customer acquisition.</p>
<p>It's not just with Rovio, though — while net sales remain steady and are 4% up year-on-year, operating income and ordinary income are both down, 54.6% and 51.8% respectively. Entertainment Contents has also dropped 31%.</p>
<p>Sega only reports two full game releases for the third quarter: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on Switch 2, and <strong>Football Manager 26</strong>, the latter of which needed "a series of updates to address post-launch bugs, etc. and improved the gameplay environment". And in general, full game titles have reported "stagnant growth".</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though: Sega is planning to release "four major new titles for mainstay IPs" next financial year, with a continued focus on expanding the trans-media business (movies, TV shows, merch, etc.). Daniel Svärd, once King's head of live game studios, will be appointed as Rovio's COO.</p>
<p>All in all, not a great showing for the company, and Sega has revised its net sales expectations to rise slightly — ¥490 billion / $3.2 billion, up from ¥475 billion / $3.1 billion — while operating income expectations have been lowered to ¥40 billion / $261.5 million, from ¥53 billion / $346.6 million.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> has <em>just</em> launched, and that will be included in the final report for the fiscal year ending March 2026. So that may help turn the tides a little. And 2026 marks the 35th anniversary for the Sonic series, so the future should be blue — in a good way.</p>
