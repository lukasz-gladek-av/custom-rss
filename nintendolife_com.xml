<p>The company states that all components for the physical editions have now arrived (which is what prompted the first delay, if you remember), but that it will take some time to get everything assembled. It's determined to release both digital and physical versions at the same time, hence the delay.</p>

<p>It's not a very long wait, which is nice, and maybe this will prove to be the perfect game to experience after the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> on 4th December.</p>
<p>Developed by Bitmap Bureau, Terminator 2D: No Fate sees you take part in key scenes from the iconic action movie, <strong>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</strong>. After completion of the game, you'll be able to replay it while making key decisions to change major events.</p>

<figure data-uuid="e19b094b29201"><a title="Nintendo Firework" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e19b094b29201/nintendo-firework.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p>"Remember remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason, and an excuse to talk about 'Jump Up, Super Star!' again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a rhyme that we Brits are all familiar with (at least, words to that effect), because here it's Guy Fawkes Night. Or Bonfire Night, if you prefer.</p>
<p>On 5th November every year, we gather in cold, wet fields and back gardens across the country to witness firework displays of varying qualities — everything from a town council splashing out with the end-of-year budget to a wobbly dad navigating the flower pots with a damp sparkler in hand. In short, today's the perfect day to talk all things that go "<em>weeeeeeiiiii BANG!!!</em>"</p>
<p>In the absence of retelling the story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot again (if you need a reminder, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgVldv9ls4">baby-faced Alex</a> told it through the medium of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a> back in 2015), we've started thinking about our favourite game fireworks.</p>
<p>A quick search through our libraries revealed that there are, actually, quite a lot of rather good fireworks sequences. We quickly realised that the bonfires would have long petered out if we tried to put together an exhaustive list of 'Every Firework Sequence in Video Games', but let's pick out some of our favourites.</p>
<p>Get your "oooh"s and "aaahh"s at the ready...</p>
<h2>Our Favourite Video Game Fireworks</h2>
<p>The following are presented in no particular order, but we'll kick things off with the first moment that <em>jumped</em> to mind...</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> - 'A Traditional Festival!'</h3>
<figure data-uuid="a2daab4bb1806"><a title="Mario Odyssey Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2daab4bb1806/mario-odyssey-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might have been too busy tapping your toes to the immensely catchy 'Jump Up, Super Star!' or quietly shedding a tear at the nostalgic beauty of it all, but Mario Odyssey's masterful 'A Traditional Festival!' sequence has fireworks lighting up the New Donk City night throughout.</p>
<p>A stunning part of a stunning game.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> - Fireworks Festival</h3>
<figure data-uuid="c1e8a17e341ff"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1e8a17e341ff/animal-crossing-new-horizons-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fireworks weren't in Animal Crossing: New Horizons at launch, which made their inclusion in the 1.4.0 Summer Update all the more exciting.</p>
<p>Come on, try to tell us that you <em>didn't</em> squeal on the first Sunday in August 2020 when you saw one of your custom designs pop up in the night sky.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_party">Wii Party</a> - 'Lucky Launch'</h3>

<p>Not all Wii Party minigames are based on skill, and 'Lucky Launch' is certainly one of the less taxing options. But doesn't that make it all the more exciting? You pick a firework, almost at random, and watch it soar into the sky, hoping it explodes last. That's it. No skill, no challenge, just good vibes.</p>
<p>The winner even gets to see their Mii's face immortalised in the bright coloured light show, which is... not as creepy as it sounds.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> - Flagpole</h3>
<figure data-uuid="bf5c8c8e2f2a8"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf5c8c8e2f2a8/super-mario-bros-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>They're perhaps not the most visually impressive fireworks by today's standards, but we distinctly remember timing our final jumps with the level countdown so we could see them in action. (The timer has to finish with a one, three, or six at the end to set off that number of fireworks, kids.)</p>
<p>Super Mario Bros. is where it all started, obviously, but we'd be lying if we said that we haven't done the same with every 2D entry since.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> - 'Greatest Jubilee'</h3>

<p>Getting the 'Greatest Jubilee' fireworks weapon in Vampire Survivors is no mean feat, consisting of lots of unlocks and a particularly nasty boss battle. When you do have it, however, you'll see the true potential of an overly crowded screen.</p>
<p>This is a game that can look busy at the best of times, so just imagine what it's like with colourful explosives thrown into the mix!</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/kirbys_return_to_dream_land">Kirby's Return to Dream Land</a> - Crackler</h3>
<figure data-uuid="98d6ec6940e35"><a title="Kirby's Return to Dream Land Crackler" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98d6ec6940e35/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-crackler.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We love just about any projectile weapon in a Kirby game, but one that fires cannonballs, which explode into colourful fireworks on impact? That rules.</p>
<p>Our fondest memories of the Crackler come from Kirby's Return to Dream Land, but you'll also find it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Air Ride</a> (and soon in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Air Riders</a>) as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kirby_triple_deluxe">Triple Deluxe</a> and the other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kirby_fighters_2">Fighters</a> games. What a beauty.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spyro_reignited_trilogy">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a> - 'Fireworks Factory'</h3>

<p>Okay, part of us feels like this is cheating a little, since Spyro 3's 'Fireworks Factory' isn't strictly speaking all that much about fireworks.</p>
<p>However, it is probably the best level in the game, and it sees Spyro gobbling up fireworks and using them as weapons against enemies. That's enough to be worthy of inclusion.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> - 'The Fireworks Artist'</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f957c95913a34"><a title="Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f957c95913a34/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the grand scheme of Echoes of Wisdom side content, 'The Fireworks Artist' is pretty low-tier, but it does result in a super sweet Echo.</p>
<p>In it, you help a Goron firework maker, Basa, see in the new chief in style with a fireworks display. It's a simple little fetch quest that doesn't take all that much thinking, but once it's done, you can learn to summon fireworks at will, and who wouldn't want to do that?</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> - 'Words Drowned by Fireworks'</h3>

<p>With <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> heading to Switch 2 at some point down the line, we won't go into all the reasons why this moment is so iconic. If you know, you know; if you don't, you're in for a treat.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> - N64 Rainbow Road</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cdf0357944dc9"><a title="Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdf0357944dc9/mario-kart-8-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Debate what the best Rainbow Road track is as much as you'd like, the N64 version is always going to be right up there. Why? Because it has funny little fireworks of every character exploding in the sky as you drive. That's why.</p>
<p>Okay, there are some other reasons, but none are quite as relevant to this list.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">Pokémon X &amp; Y</a> - Parfum Palace</h3>

<p>Pokémon X &amp; Y has a surprising number of genuinely touching moments, and the Parfum Palace fireworks sequence is one of them. Shauna opens up about how she wants to remember the show forever (either because she's never watched fireworks with a boy before or because she wants to remain "great friends", depending on which avatar you pick), and the twinkly piano keys help sell it.</p>
<p>If you happened to catch the sequence at night, you're in for a great show. If you watch it in the day... ehhhh, not so much.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/big_bang_mini">Big Bang Mini</a></h3>

<p>Oh, you thought we'd make it through this list without mentioning the DS shmup, Big Bang Mini? It's literally a game all about fireworks!</p>
<p>It might not be the best shoot 'em up out there, but we're hard pushed to think of a game with <em>more</em> firework displays to its name.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>That's some of our favourites, but which sits at your top spot? Do any of the above have your heart aglow, or have we missed a big hitter? How many shoot 'em ups with more impressive pyrotechnic displays can you name? Let us know in the following poll and the comments, Guys.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a fresh new look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and while much of the footage is recycled from previous trailers, there were definitely a few interesting new shots to consider.</p>
<p>One of these is pretty throwaway at first glance, but a few fans online believe it might be hiding a pretty significant hint. It occurs at <strong>0:23</strong> and depicts a weird little insect creature crawling/slithering along the ground and leaving a trail of gunk in its wake.</p>
<p>So what is this thing, then? Well, chances are it's probably just one of the game's normal enemies, but some folks think it could be something more. If you cast your mind back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_hunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a>, you might remember that Kanden, one of the bounty hunters Samus encounters on her journey, is able to transform into the slug-like Stinglarva form, much like Samus' own Morph Ball ability.</p>

<p>Could this strange insect in the Prime 4 trailer actually be Kanden in Stinglarva form? Well, we're not entirely convinced at this stage. For starters, while we can't get a really good look at the creature, it nevertheless differs in look to Kanden. It's not quite so mechanical in nature, and we're certain it's also sporting a pair of hefty mandibles and some tiny little legs.</p>
<p>Then again, designs can be changed, so we're not going to rule it out <em>completely</em>. We'll keep an open mind, but we reckon Samus has enough on her plate with that cheeky monkey Sylux roaming about. Goodness knows she doesn't need to deal with Kanden too!</p>

<figure data-uuid="3f3a17ae046c5"><a title="Kanden" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f3a17ae046c5/kanden.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
