<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza / Mario Odyssey Pauline" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d91b0cb478cbd/donkey-kong-bananza-mario-odyssey-pauline.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the second Nintendo revealed Pauline was in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a timeline theory began to take shape in our heads. But then we wrapped the game up, and our prequel presumptions weren't as nailed on as we'd expected.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official answer for how Bananza Pauline is related to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Pauline, and according to producer Kenta Motokura, we ain't going to get one any time soon.</p>
<p>This stems from a recent <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3lzbwv3as5c2w">@Stealth40K</a>), in which some of Bananza's key creatives sat down to chat all things DK. The answers cover many of the same topics we saw in the game's Ask the Developer series, but the question of Pauline's timeline is a newbie — albeit one that was somewhat brushed aside.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4hjixsy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>When asked about Bananza Pauline's connection to Odyssey's New Donk City mayor, Motokura deftly dodged the topic, saying (via Google Translate), "That's... Of course, the developers have a plan for it, but I'm sorry, but I'd like you to use your imagination". <em>Gah</em>! And there we were, thinking an answer was on the horizon.</p>
<p>And what about that Grandma that 13-year-old Pauline brings up so often in Bananza's Getaway naps? There must be a connection there, right? "Sorry, this too", said Motokura. <em>Double gah</em>!</p>
<p>Now, that little tease of the developers having "a plan" for Pauline's heritage has us wondering if we're going to return to this timeline topic again in the future — we'd be amazed if we don't get another 3D DK game somewhere down the line. Alternatively, of course, Motokura could just be implying that the dev team has their theories, just like we all do, but we're never going to hear 'em. The latter seems all the more realistic, knowing Nintendo.</p>
<p>Okay, so Nintendo isn't going to spill the beans on this one just yet, but that doesn't mean we can't keep on theorising. Don't worry, we won't spoil the end of Bananza here, but if you want to read all about the game's finale and how we reckon it may/may not tie into Odyssey, you can find a full rundown in the guide below.</p>

<p>Dropping two days earlier on other platforms</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Windwalk Games and Team17 have announced that the release date for their upcoming co-op roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sworn">Sworn</a>, has been shifted from 25th September, a.k.a. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> Day™, to 23rd September on PC and (other) consoles, with a Switch version due to arrive at "a later date."</p>
<p>This colourful roguelike from "a team of veteran developers from Riot Games, Niantic, and Blizzard" takes inspiration from the art of the legendary Mike Mignola, has been available on PC in early access since February, where it's gone down very well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1763250/SWORN/">sat as it is on a very positive rating</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's a <em>very</em> similar-looking affair to Hades 2 , so we can't really blame Team17 for shifting the launch date to give version 1.0 a little breathing room. But Sworn also offers something of its own, with up to four-player co-op available for you and your pals to dig into while exploring a cursed Camelot.</p>

<p>Here's some official info about the game, and we'll be sure to let you know when the Switch date is set in stone. Like a big sword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose to play solo or with friends, summoning the blessings of the Fae Lords in this action rogue-like set in a cursed Avalon. Only through your mastery of unique weapons, many ability options and the help of powerful allies such as Merlin can there be hope for realm. Coinigh dó neart leat! Sworn encourages players to be versatile in the ever-changing battlegrounds of Camelot and to do whatever it takes to halt the grim plans of Arthur and his dishonourable Knights. <strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Solo and Co-op<br></strong>Play solo or unite with up to 4 friends to stand off against the Knights of the Round Table. Choose from 4 characters: Vigilante, Rook, Spectre, and Monk and combine the strengths of each character in surprising ways and master abilities to become knights worthy of standing off against Arthur himself.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a foredoomed Avalon</strong><br>
Meet familiar friends and foes inspired by myths and Legends, in this beautifully crafted comic world, inspired by the work of American artist Mike Mignola.</p>
<p><strong>Power divine from the Fae</strong><br>
Swear fealty to the Fae Lords and choose from over 200 unique blessings to unleash your full potential. Will you avail of King Oberon you fury bonuses and damaging whirlwinds or perhaps Banshee Cliona’s aid of soul missiles.</p>
<p><strong>Creatively conquer Camelot</strong><br>
Combine your blessings with unique character, weapon, and ability selections. Test thousands of unique builds as you become a seasoned knight.</p>
<p><strong>Become worthy</strong><br>
Upgrades from the Beacon of Avalore will forge your squire into a worthy champion over time. However, if you believe you are already worthy of facing Arthur, get ready for a challenge that will put your skills to the test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/09/two-games-are-available-early-this-week-with-xbox-game-pass-september-22-23#sworn-series-xs-pc-cloud-september-23">our sister site Pure Xbox</a>, Sworn is dropping on Game Pass Ultimate tomorrow, too — another place to check it out if you can't wait for that 'TBA' Switch date. Team17 is putting the game out physically on Switch, so watch this space.</p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon x Natural History Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9d1aea86d3df6/pokemon-x-natural-history-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>London is no stranger to a Pokémon pop-up shop these days, and The Pokémon Company has today announced that we can expect to see another one hit the capital city next year. In the Natural History Museum, no less!</p>
<p>From <strong>26th January to 22nd March 2026</strong>, the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop will be getting a Pokémon twist, stocking exclusive collaboration products including clothing, plushies, accessories and more. Many of these products have been made specifically for the collaboration, so expect to see more than a little historical flair in their designs.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fozvirw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, this is a Pokémon pop-up that we're talking about here, so the event will be ticketed. You'll be able to pick up a <em>free</em> ticket to the shop from the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html?utm_source=pokemon-press-announcement-20250922-hp&amp;utm_medium=nhm-press&amp;utm_campaign=retail">Natural History Museum website</a> from <strong>1st October</strong>, and you can register for the priority list right now.</p>
<p>Products from the Pokémon x NHM collection will also be available via the museum's online store, and a selection will be added to the official Pokémon Center UK website in January.</p>
<p>It may not be a Pokémon <em>Center</em>, as such, but we're always excited to see more Pokémon shopping opportunities come to Europe. Let's just hope that things go a little smoother than they did in the Louvre back in 2023.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 launch title hit a speed boost this week and cruised past former champion <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> to take the top spot. It was a short-lived triumph for Gearbox's latest, but we're sure the Nintendo release in a couple of weeks will help bolster the numbers</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> sticks around in third, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is <em>somehow</em> the fifth best-seller, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky: 1st Chapter</a> makes its chart debut at 19th, with 34% of sales coming from the Switch release.</p>
<p>But that's quite enough waffling, here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>
