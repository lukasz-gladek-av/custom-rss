<p>It's cartoon o'clock</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are just one week away from the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> on Switch and Switch 2, and to mark the occasion, Tribute Games and Dotemu have released the game's opening movie to keep the hype train a-moving.</p>
<p>Now, for those who have been paying attention to all the character reveals and behind-the-scenes looks in recent months, some of this footage might not be all that new; if, however, you're coming in with fresh eyes, be prepared for some Saturday morning cartoon nostalgia.</p>
<p>The opening film provides a neat character-by-character rundown of the game's 15-fighter roster, each reimagined in the '90s cartoon visuals that Tribute has so clearly been inspired by.</p>
<p>We get to see Captain America and Spider-Man taking out Annihilus' bug bros on the streets, Beta Ray Bill and the Silver Surfer handing out beatings in space, and even a handful of familiar foe faces like that of Thanos, Galactus, and Modok.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like Cosmic Invasion will go a long way to scratch a similar nostalgic itch that the developer/publisher duo hit upon with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> back in 2022. There's only one week to go until we find out.</p>
