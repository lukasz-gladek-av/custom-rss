<p>No one could USB-C this...</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 and Switch 2 USB-C" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75ab9eb41aa1c/switch-1-and-switch-2-usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the launch of the Switch 2, accessory manufacturers have been rushing to bring their products to the market in a bid to offer alternatives to Nintendo's own set, including docks. The latter has been causing headaches for many, and it seems Nintendo has put in place restrictions on the console's USB-C ports.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">The Verge's Sean Hollister</a> has been looking into the Switch 2's USB-C port and was told this was the case after speaking to two accessory manufacturers. What should happen is that, when the console is popped into a dock via the USB-C adapter, it kicks off a series of commands that allow the power supply/dock to output video. That's an <em>extremely</em> oversimplified explanation. That's not happening when you connect the Switch 2 to most third-party docks, however.</p>
<p>According to The Verge's sources, the Switch 2 uses a new kind of dedicated encryption chip and scheme and, upon testing, Hollister saw (as he puts it) "the new Nintendo Switch not behaving like a good USB citizen should".</p>
<p>As a result, companies like Jsaux have told The Verge that it's halted plans to make a Switch 2 dock because they simply can't get around the problem right now. Hollister has found some docks that work so far — the <strong>SIWIQU for Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Station</strong>, AverMedia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwdSkzN7Iw&amp;ab_channel=AVerMediaContentCreators">own dock</a>, and Viture's virtual glasses hub.</p>
<p>Others on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lmbroo/siwiqu_antank_s3_max_dock_works_perfectly/">NintendoSwitch2 subreddit</a> say the same thing about the SIWIQU, but there's understandable caution when very few <em>actually</em> work, and when early Switch 1 docks also caused problems.</p>

<p>Manufacturers expect Nintendo will try to "maintain device and system security" via updates, and the Switch 2 does have extra fans — including a fan in the dock itself — as the console runs a little hotter than the Switch 1. It may well be that there's something in Nintendo's upscaling tech that's causing issues with other docks. Or, it could just be that Nintendo is trying to prevent any potential issues that may be caused by unofficial docks.</p>
<p>It's a more powerful dock all around, and it does much more than the Switch 1's ever did. So it looks like this will be an ongoing battle, though we're sure that we'll see plenty of third-party options pop up in the future.</p>

<p>Join Morpeko on his first outing</p>

<figure><a title="Morpeko's First Outing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/58d475b3ff27e/morpekos-first-outing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon Company has kicked off a new series of shorts over on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/youtube">YouTube</a>. The first one is out today, and it's utterly adorable.</p>
<p>Shared by <a href="https://www.serebii.net/anime/other/morpeko'sfirstouting.shtml">Serebii</a>, <strong>Morpeko's First Outing</strong> is the first episode of a new series called <strong>Pokémon Summer Stories</strong>, which we can only imagine are cute little adventures focusing on the fun of the summer holiday season. With added Pokémon, of course.</p>
<p>This episode focuses on Shota and his companion Morpeko. Shota joins up with his friends Haru and Takeru, who are all heading to a beach festival to see the Pokémon Bisharp. You can watch the whole 11 minute episode below.</p>
<p>While it's currently only in Japanese right now, that doesn't stop us admiring the lovely animation style and seeing some of our favourite Pokémon looking brighter and more-colourful than ever. Hopefully, as more episodes come out, they'll get an English dub (or subs!).</p>

<p>Pokémon is, of course, no stranger to animation, and there are a few exciting projects coming up for the multimedia franchise. <strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Concierge</strong> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/netflix-confirms-new-episodes-of-pokemon-concierge-are-on-the-way">set to return to Netflix with brand new episodes</a> in the future, and British stop-motion animation studio <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/pokemon-announces-collaboration-with-wallace-and-gromit-studio">Aardman are currently working with TPC on a "project'</a>.</p>

<p>What the 4K?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9299fed9e4f4b/switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remember all of the confusion around whether the Switch 2 supports VRR? One moment, it did both docked and handheld, before Nintendo started removing wording surrounding docked VRR from websites and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">then apologised "for the error"</a>.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/697937/nintendo-switch-2-vrr-steam-deck-rog-x-ally-120hz">The Verge</a> (paywalled) has made an interesting discovery — the Switch 2's dock <em>does</em> support VRR, but it doesn't work with the Switch 2 itself. How did editor Sean Hollister find this out? By taking inspiration from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1lnh0fe/psa_switch_2_dock_supports_vrr_and_hdr_on_steam/">SteamDeck subreddit</a> and plugging a Steam Deck into the dock. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Using a USB-C male-to-female extension cable, you can plug your Steam Deck directly into the Switch 2's Dock, where the option to enable VRR will pop up. So if you really want to, you can play your Steam Deck games at 4K and 120fps this way.</p>

<p>Other handhelds tested include Lenovo Legion Go S using SteamOS, and the Asus ROG Ally X using the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">BazziteOS</a>, another Linux-based operating system. And rather than just relying on the menu, Hollister did use an open-source VRR testing tool. So we're all good.</p>
<p>So it begs the question — why the heck is Nintendo not taking advantage of this? It could be that the company wants to do more testing before issuing a firmware update later down the line. We're not going to know the answer, basically.</p>
<p>And hey, at least VRR <em>is</em> readily available undocked.</p>
<p><em>Have you tried plugging your handheld PC into your Switch 2 dock? Do you want to see VRR support enabled on Switch 2 while docked? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>His appointment "could lead to an interesting future"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shigeru Miyamoto E3 2015 dolls" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cadad5db1bad/shigeru-miyamoto-e3-2015-dolls.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shigeru Miyamoto has spoken about the appointment of Nintendo's newest outside director Kazuhiko Hachiya, director of the Japanese doll company <a href="https://global.petworks.store/">PetWORKS</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto addressed a question on the increased number of outside directors "with diverse backgrounds", including Illumination CEO and <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> co-producer Chris Meledandri and Hachiya-san, who was revealed to be joining as a member of the board <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-appoints-doll-company-executive-as-a-new-outside-director">back in May</a>.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya is a media artist who is active beyond the framework of games, and I have known<br>
him personally for a long time", says Miyamoto, revealing a connection between Hachiya and Nintendo through their relationship.</p>
<p>Miyamoto says he's been "discussing" the backgrounds of all the outside directors with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa and that the two "have been exploring various possibilities".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya engages in unconventional activities, such as researching video games and building his own equipment. We believe that a connection between Mr. Hachiya and our company could lead to an interesting future, which is why we wanted him to join us as an outside director."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miyamoto's not wrong about Hachiya's background, which we covered briefly back when the artist was appointed. Does Miyamoto's vague answer hint at some art collaboration or Nintendo-themed dolls? Or something beyond that? We probably won't find out for a good while, anyhow.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/convocation_notice2506e.pdf">Convocation Notice of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a> — which is essentially an invite to the annual meeting and details the board members and the agenda — Hachiya is described as having "a wide range of achievements", which include art created by using digital tech and developing an email client.</p>
<div><p>He's also served in multiple key positions at Tokyo University of the Arts, where he is currently a professor in the Department of Intermedia Art and director of the Art Media Center. Nintendo believes that Hachiya will bring valuable experience and be able to supervise "based on his broad experience and insight in the field of art, and as a software developer and business executive".</p><p>

Essentially, we have <em>no</em> idea what this collaboration will bring about, but we're excited to see what Kazuhiko Hachiya can bring to the table.</p></div>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Hachiya's appointment in the comments</em>.</p>
