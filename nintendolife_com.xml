<p>And it's looking gooey</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It only feels like yesterday that Bloober Team confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> would be launching on the Switch 2. Yet here we are, merely a couple of weeks from its <strong>5th September</strong> release, and the lovely Felix has gone hands-on with the title during his stint at Gamescom (yes, Felix said it's out on the 4th, but it's been a very busy week for him).</p>
<p>Despite some initial confusion around his appointment, Felix got to spend a decent chunk of time with Cronos and came away feeling pretty good about the whole thing. The demo showcased some solid survival horror gameplay in which creepy creatures would merge with corpses to form all new types of monstrosities, all of which are simply <em>begging</em> to be put out of their misery.</p>
<p>It's important to note with the Switch version that the game runs at 30fps with some key visual downgrades when compared to the likes of the PC and PS5. That said, it still looks pretty decent, and Bloober Team's fantastic work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake gives us high hopes for this one.</p>
<p>If you're more keen on checking out some direct-feed gameplay with no commentary, then good news, because we also have that for you just below. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Docked and loaded</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, we were lucky enough to head to the Nintendo booth at Gamescom and go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">hands-on</a> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> on Switch 2. Bandai Namco didn't allow any footage to be recorded from our handheld session (and we quickly saw why), but it seems such recording rules are not in place at Canada's <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/">Fan Expo</a>, which kicked off yesterday and was allowing over-the-shoulder recording of the docked demos.</p>
<p>One visitor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MDee14">MDee14</a>, recorded footage of their entire play session and has quickly shared it online, giving us our first proper look at how this thing runs when the Switch 2 is up on a big screen. Fortunately, it looks better than the handheld offering seems to be.</p>
<p>The video (above) shows the attendee's entire preview session, from the opening tutorial section to some early exploration around Limgrave. The performance is far from what you'd expect to see on a PS5, but it seems to hold up <em>pretty</em> well, with the noticeable drops coming from big sequences like the opening of the Limgrave gate. Things seem okay otherwise, but let's bear in mind that this kind of over-the-shoulder footage isn't always the best way to see every little detail.</p>
<p>Our brief hands-on time with the game in handheld told a very different story. It looks like docked mode might be the way to go with this one (at least, in whatever build is being shown in expos at the moment), as our handheld play was plagued with hefty frame drops and stutters a-plenty — though no capture was allowed for these sessions, naturally.</p>
<p>We're still waiting on a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, but let's hope that we don't have too long to wait before we can see the launch performance really put through its paces.</p>

<p>"I hoped it would be you, little brother"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Netflix has debuted its teaser trailer for the upcoming second season of <strong>Devil May Cry</strong>, the animated adaptation of Capcom's acclaimed action series.</p>
<p>Due for release in <strong>2026</strong>, the anime is seemingly putting the spotlight on Dante's brother, Virgil, setting up a big showdown between the two character's following the latter's last-minute appearance in the previous season.</p>
<p>It's unclear how much time has passed since the first season, but you can see that Dante himself is sporting slightly longer locks while rocking the more traditional, long-sleeved red trench coat. Pretty badass.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's now been over six years since the last mainline game title, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/devil_may_cry_5">Devil May Cry 5</a>, launched in 2019, with a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/devil_may_cry_5_special_edition">Special Edition</a> following in 2020. We're hopeful that a Switch 2 port may crop up at some point, but with veteran director <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/capcoms-hideaki-itsuno-leaves-after-30-years-starts-new-role-in-september">Hideaki Itsuno leaving Capcom in 2024</a>, it's unclear at this stage what the future holds regarding brand new entries.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 and Switch 1 dominance that you see in the software chart above carries over to the hardware numbers. Nintendo's latest is still holding onto a commanding lead, with an additional 179,641 sales in the latest two-week period — that big two million milestone is right around the corner.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 systems combine this time for a total of 37,346, while the three PS5 SKUs come in at 17,131. And that's the <em>old</em> Switch!</p>

<p>What could it be..?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Acclaim, which was revived earlier this year after more than two decades of dormancy, is teasing some sort of announcement for next week.</p>
<p>It's tough to know exactly what this entails at this stage, and the only clue within the above tease is a very quick cut to show some sort of digital, demonic face with power symbols surrounding it. We've screenshotted this and included it below for your perusal. Any ideas..?</p>
<p>Within its PR release, Acclaim promises "big things to come" and is supposedly hard at work on its "mission to bring players unforgettable, lasting experiences that will keep them coming back for more".</p>
<p>Sounds intriguing, at least. We're not expecting big name franchises at this early stage of Acclaim's revival, but we'll be sure to keep an eye on the upcoming teaser and let you know how things shake out.</p>
