<p>Microsoft axed the studio behind the new project this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Perfect Dark" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b82c61e49a066/perfect-dark.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/perfect_dark">Perfect Dark</a> series has been under Microsoft's control for more than two decades now, the news this week about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/microsoft-announces-another-wave-of-layoffs-over-9000-jobs-affected">the latest entry by The Initiative being axed</a> has led to a lot of reactions within the Nintendo community.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Joanna's voice actor Alix Wilton Regan (who was cast in the now-cancelled project) is rallying fans of the video game agent and calling on them to "speak up" on social media and elsewhere online if they want to see this series "survive". <em>Yes, it's that grim!</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6zihmnj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A lot of people have been reaching out and floating this idea on my timeline, my phone and in my DMs, so I’m just gonna say it... #PerfectDark #PerfectPickUp speak up if you wanna see Perfect Dark survive"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the chances of the latest project getting revived in some way or form appear to be very slim at this stage, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/perfect-dark-actor-calls-on-fans-to-speak-up-and-help-the-game-survive">as our colleagues at Pure Xbox note</a>, there have been some surprising outcomes and scenarios before, such as when Microsoft folded Tango Gameworks (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>) and Krafton stepped in to revive the studio.</p>
<p>Of course, Regan's aim here is to simply get Perfect Dark fans to show their love for Joanna in hopes <em>something</em> might change or happen, or elevate the chances of someone stepping in to save the day – including the studio behind the cancelled project (<em>and dare we say Joanna's future</em>).</p>
<p>If you were about during the N64 generation, Agent Dark's 64-bit outing was one of the best experiences available on the platform. And although her latest project has been cancelled, you can still at least experience her classic first-person shooter on the Switch and Switch 2 via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack "Mature" app.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark isn't the only IP Microsoft has been accused of sitting on since acquiring the legendary British developer from Nintendo in the early 2000s. Although it did bring back <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> during the Xbox 360 generation, the famous bird and bear have been stashed away for a long time now – with many fans and former developers losing hope of a comeback.</p>
<p>Apart from Joanna's latest mission, Microsoft also cancelled Rare's next project <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/everwild">Everwild</a></strong> this week, a title that was originally announced more than five years ago.</p>

<p>Looking back on this week first, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> for the GameCube NSO app on Switch 2. It's a solid title, and you can see exactly where it lands in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">GameCube ranking for Switch 2</a> so far.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it emerged that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">Nintendo is facing a legal challenge from Brazil</a> thanks to its ability to ban Switch 2 consoles, while both major Zelda titles on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-breath-of-the-wild-updates-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">received a cheeky little update</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is also facing a bit of controversy recently, with folks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">review-bombing the game</a> after Nintendo's latest update.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m off to see some friends this weekend and I know they haven’t played any Switch 2 yet.</p>
<p>So I’m packing up my dock and camera and I’m off to introduce everybody to the joys of Mario Kart World when you can see the faces of the racers in front of you. We’ll see whether they’re still my friends once Monday rolls around…</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I actually started playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> recently, and although it's not my usual cup of tea, I'm actually having a blast with it.</p>
<p>I'm also playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> again on the Switch 2, taking full advantage of that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/22-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">bump up to 60fps</a>. And yes, I still love it.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. Again. And probably will be until I get my hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a>. I'll be taking the Switch 2 with me on holiday next week, so it'll be the first time travelling with the console, and what better way to travel than to spend time levelling crafting jobs, eh?</p>
<p>Otherwise, some Mario Kart World with friends is in order. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is incredible how Next Level games kicked-off Super Mario Strikers so flawlessly from the opening whistle. Input and online latency aside, this will be quite good fun to spend some of the weekend’s gaming plans. Also: Sass. Every character is full of sass and attitude which was quite amusing to see back then – glad Nintendo allowed it.</p>
<p>I’ve made my way onto <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> chapter 10 during the week and things are quickly heating up with a setup for the inevitable Kiryu-Majima showdown. I’m unsure how long I have left to see the end credits on this excellent re-edition, but I’m sure it will be a really fun time.</p>
<p>And then there is the second Namco Model 22 Arcade Archives outing! Ace Combat 22 brings a ton of memories. While the game is a bit bare-bones (and most assuredly a coin muncher), the fact I used to play this at local sit-down arcade cabinet several months before even dreaming of owning Air Combat (which is quite a different experience despite sharing the core visuals) on the PS1 makes it quite special. Maybe I will actually complete Top Gun mode before I run out of coins.</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> last weekend but I’m sure to correct that before Monday arrives. Dead or alive, someone is most definitely coming with me.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Lots on the menu this weekend. Can you believe we've had Switch 2 now for a whole month?</p>
<p>As ever, the question is whether I'll actually get to any of the games I plan on playing. I've got an appetite for a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>, digging into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>, and polishing off a dozen other things. I want to spend more time with the GameCube app, too.</p>
<p>But will I just end up noodling around in Mario Kart World picking up Peach coins and P Switches? Yes, that's almost certainly what I'll end up doing. Same time next week, shall we?</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I recently got my hands on an <em>adorable</em> Xbox Series S, after years of wanting one but having no good reason to do so. This weekend I'm keen to put it through its paces, playing the likes of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> – whatever's modern and on GamePass really. What do you mean 'obviously this is preparation for a video'?</p>
<p>I'd ask you not to read too much into my personal affairs, thank you very much.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This weekend I'm on holiday in SPAIIIIN, which means being outside in 35°C heat. It's great. It's so great.</p><p>

Luckily for you readers, that means a lot of my time is spent inside in air-conditioned hotels and cafés, playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. I'm about 30 days in, and let me tell you, it's a SLOW burn, but a good one. And it's genuinely quite funny to play the game as a <strong>Danganronpa</strong>/<strong>Zero Escape</strong> fan and see all the ways in which Hundred Line is exactly a mashup of those two, complete with a genuinely delightful amount of jokes about how it is exactly that. I mean, there's a character that keeps going on about how she hopes it's a killing game with students and an evil teddy bear mascot. Which it kind of is!</p><p>

It's great, though, despite the mildly tedious Danganronpa "improve your stats and figure out what gifts to give people" side quests. Only 70 more days to go (until I get to NG+, anyway)!</p></div>

<p>"More than 100 staff without jobs"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Romero Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62cb7c5b0b801/romero-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd">@romerogamesltd</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been another tough week for the video game industry and the fallout from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-hit-with-layoffs-following-microsoft-xbox-cuts">Microsoft's layoffs led to funding cuts</a> at John and Brenda Romero's studio, Romero Games.</p>
<p>Now, following some claims the independant studio had completely shut its doors, Irish publication The Journal has got apparently got an official confirmation about this in a statement from Brenda Romero (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-shuttered-and-over-100-staff-axed-after-xbox-pulls-funding">thanks, Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>It's mentioned how the decision was made at a "high level" within Microsoft and well above the studio's own "visibility and control".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time...We’re heartbroken that it’s come to this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romero Games reportedly employed 42 studio members "directly", with its broader network for its latest project at "more than 100" people.</p>
<p>An "anonymous" staff member of the Galway-based studio told the source it's been a "big shock" as the team had only had meetings with its publisher the "day before this happened". There was also apparently no warning, and it's further claimed there are "no remaining funds to continue operations".</p>
<p>John Romero is one of the co-creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>, and the studio he co-founded with his wife went on to release multiple titles including the strategy RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/empire_of_sin">Empire of Sin</a> for the Switch in 2020. The same developer also released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/doom-plus-doom-ii-switch-update-3-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">SIGIL and SIGIL 2</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>

<p>While it might not be the launch title <em>everyone</em> was hoping for, it's still packed with plenty of things to do. This includes a new Knockout Tour mode, a whole world to free roam, and plenty of classic options like Grand Prix, local and online multiplayer, Time Trials, and Battle Mode.</p>
<p>So, how much time have you spent in Mario Kart World so far? What mode have you played the most and what would you rate the game now that you've had an entire month with it (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">and after that recent patch</a>)?

<p>Who needs an OLED TV when you have a widescreen CRT TV?</p>
<p>Okay, genuinely, CRT scanlines are gorgeous and we have a huge soft spot for these chunky units. Sitting on the floor, looking up at the screen as we ran around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a>; pure bliss.</p>
<p>The Switch 2, with its 120fps capabilities and VRR in handheld, is a much more powerful console than the N64 (duh!). So why on earth would we want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> on a 27 inch CRT TV?</p>
<p>Well, our lovely video producer Zion is here to show you just what playing a Switch 2 on a CRT TV is like, and honestly? It's magical. From newer titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> to retro indie throwbacks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, Zion's running down the wonderful nostalgia of playing games on an old TV.</p>
<p>Is it the <em>best</em> way to play the Switch 2? No way. Is it fascinating? Heck yes. It takes a fair bit of set-up and it'll vary depending on what kind of TV you have, but if you're interested, check out Zion's video up top and let us know in the comments whether you want to try this out</p>

<p>But new catches, new games, and a new studio are in the net</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Dredge" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c2c5ca2c7e18/dredge.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team17</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lovecraftian fishing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> was a hit back in 2023, blending unsettling horror and sea creatures with atmospheric storytelling and some good ol' reeling in. Now, after some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/reminder-dredges-new-expansion-update-the-iron-rig-is-out-now">paid DLC</a> and free updates, the New Zealand-based developer is ready to move on from the seas and create something brand new — and "No, it's not Dredge 2".</p>
<p>Sharing the news on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blacksaltgames.com/post/3lt3r7344a22o">Bluesky</a>, the team's next title will be an open-world RPG in a new world and setting. It'll still be dark, of course, but it's something <em>very</em> different from the studio's first shipment.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067swmoxh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But that's not the only new announcement; Black Salt has expanded and opened up a second development studio, called Disc 2 Games. "Think bright, colourful and 90's retro!" says the announcement post. Oh, <em>we're thinking, all right.</em></p>

<p>“We’ve taken DREDGE as far as we can technically – especially while continuing to support players on previous-gen consoles,” producer and CEO of Disc 2 Nadia Thorne shared in <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/Black-Salt-Games-Announces-New-Studio-and-Next-Projects">a press release</a>. The studio is eager to "turn our attention to something new” and move on.</p>
<p>Programmer and writer at Black Salt Games Joel Mason echoes Thorne's sentiments, saying "It's reaffirming to know that players enjoy the types of worlds that we want to create - and gives us the confidence to try to do it again."</p>
<p>In terms of Disc 2, the studio has apparently been working on their debut game "for a bit over a year now" says technical director Kris Nicholson. And, despite the proposed colourful facade of the upcoming game, creative director Johannes Otte is setting our expectations appropriately; "beneath this polished surface lies a gritty world, waiting for players to immerse themselves in and join our characters in rebelling against.”</p>
<p>This is fantastic news to read in an industry that feels like it's collapsing in on itself sometimes, and we can't wait to see more from both studios.</p>

<p>No one could USB-C this...</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 and Switch 2 USB-C" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75ab9eb41aa1c/switch-1-and-switch-2-usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the launch of the Switch 2, accessory manufacturers have been rushing to bring their products to the market in a bid to offer alternatives to Nintendo's own set, including docks. The latter has been causing headaches for many, and it seems Nintendo has put in place restrictions on the console's USB-C ports.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">The Verge's Sean Hollister</a> has been looking into the Switch 2's USB-C port and was told this was the case after speaking to two accessory manufacturers. What should happen is that, when the console is popped into a dock via the USB-C adapter, it kicks off a series of commands that allow the power supply/dock to output video. That's an <em>extremely</em> oversimplified explanation. That's not happening when you connect the Switch 2 to most third-party docks, however.</p>
<p>According to The Verge's sources, the Switch 2 uses a new kind of dedicated encryption chip and scheme and, upon testing, Hollister saw (as he puts it) "the new Nintendo Switch not behaving like a good USB citizen should".</p>
<p>As a result, companies like Jsaux have told The Verge that it's halted plans to make a Switch 2 dock because they simply can't get around the problem right now. Hollister has found some docks that work so far — the <strong>SIWIQU for Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Station</strong>, AverMedia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwdSkzN7Iw&amp;ab_channel=AVerMediaContentCreators">own dock</a>, and Viture's virtual glasses hub.</p>
<p>Others on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lmbroo/siwiqu_antank_s3_max_dock_works_perfectly/">NintendoSwitch2 subreddit</a> say the same thing about the SIWIQU, but there's understandable caution when very few <em>actually</em> work, and when early Switch 1 docks also caused problems.</p>

<p>Manufacturers expect Nintendo will try to "maintain device and system security" via updates, and the Switch 2 does have extra fans — including a fan in the dock itself — as the console runs a little hotter than the Switch 1. It may well be that there's something in Nintendo's upscaling tech that's causing issues with other docks. Or, it could just be that Nintendo is trying to prevent any potential issues that may be caused by unofficial docks.</p>
<p>It's a more powerful dock all around, and it does much more than the Switch 1's ever did. So it looks like this will be an ongoing battle, though we're sure that we'll see plenty of third-party options pop up in the future.</p>

<p>Join Morpeko on his first outing</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Morpeko's First Outing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/58d475b3ff27e/morpekos-first-outing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon Company has kicked off a new series of shorts over on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/youtube">YouTube</a>. The first one is out today, and it's utterly adorable.</p>
<p>Shared by <a href="https://www.serebii.net/anime/other/morpeko'sfirstouting.shtml">Serebii</a>, <strong>Morpeko's First Outing</strong> is the first episode of a new series called <strong>Pokémon Summer Stories</strong>, which we can only imagine are cute little adventures focusing on the fun of the summer holiday season. With added Pokémon, of course.</p>
<p>This episode focuses on Shota and his companion Morpeko. Shota joins up with his friends Haru and Takeru, who are all heading to a beach festival to see the Pokémon Bisharp. You can watch the whole 11 minute episode below.</p>
<p>While it's currently only in Japanese right now, that doesn't stop us admiring the lovely animation style and seeing some of our favourite Pokémon looking brighter and more-colourful than ever. Hopefully, as more episodes come out, they'll get an English dub (or subs!).</p>

<p>Pokémon is, of course, no stranger to animation, and there are a few exciting projects coming up for the multimedia franchise. <strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Concierge</strong> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/netflix-confirms-new-episodes-of-pokemon-concierge-are-on-the-way">set to return to Netflix with brand new episodes</a> in the future, and British stop-motion animation studio <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/pokemon-announces-collaboration-with-wallace-and-gromit-studio">Aardman are currently working with TPC on a "project'</a>.</p>
