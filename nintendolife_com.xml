<p>Ludicrously long titles are so hot right now</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby Star-Crossed World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aeb2a2e0e584f/kirby-star-crossed-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Kirby landed on Nintendo's latest console last week, a few months ahead of his upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> in November.</p>
<p>The updated version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> followed on from the snazzy Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game released in July, the (similarly) laboriously titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>, adding some bespoke new stuff into the brilliant base game along with the resolution and frame rate upgrades you'd expect.</p>
<p>PJ gave <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Star-Crossed World</a> a sparkling 9/10 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">in his review</a>. It's perhaps Kirby's finest game, now even bigger and better. What's not to like? Besides the $80 price tag, of course. It's sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2/">"Generally Favorable" Metascore of 83</a> as of today, so it seems it's doing something right.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/kirby/related-articles:186479 @ 1756753287 -->
<p>Have you picked up the upgrade? Or have you, like one Jim Norman of Nintendo Life, jumped into the Forgotten Land for the first time on Switch 2? We're keen to hear what score you'd award this latest NS2 Edition. Remember, if you haven't played it yet, you can return at any time and score the game from 1-10 as you see fit, or adjust your score if you change your mind.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you've already rated Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World (<em>wheeze</em>) in our database, thank you! Your score already counts in the poll below, so no need to duplicate it.</p>

<figure><a title="007 First Light" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef7d9f6bf856f/007-first-light.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: IO Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p>IO Interactive's latest flagship title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, is heading to the Switch 2 in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to an upcoming <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/">State of Play</a> from PlayStation (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/state-of-play-confirmed-for-3rd-september-deep-dive-on-007-first-light">Push Square</a>), we're getting our first proper deep dive into the title's gameplay later this week on <strong>Wednesday, 3rd September</strong>.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the footage showcased in the State of Play won't be representative of the game on Switch 2. IO's recent port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> wasn't exactly the gold standard in terms of performance, with the game struggling to hit its 60fps target for the majority of the time. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hitman-world-of-assassination-updated-on-switch-2-here-are-the-patch-notes">A recent patch</a> introduced a new option to lock the frame rate at 30fps, making for a generally more pleasant experience.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3wkyinz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Performance concerns aside, though, we're fully expecting First Light on Switch 2 to be on par with other platforms when it comes to features and gameplay. The showcase itself will last for more than 30 minutes, and will feature "a playthrough of Bond’s first mission as an MI6 recruit. The action includes everything from high-speed car chases to on-foot stealth sequences and shootouts".</p>
<p>It all kicks off at <strong>11am PT / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST</strong>, and we'll be sure to keep you up to speed on any significant announcements that the livestream may bring.</p>
