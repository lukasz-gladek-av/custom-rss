            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Plenty of people are busy revisiting two of the Switch 1's greatest games — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> — on Switch 2. The frame a resolution boost are pretty remarkable in our eyes, and it seems like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-zelda-upgraded-on-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-tested">Digital Foundry agrees</a> with our assessment, calling the upgrades "transformative", especially for the 2023 sequel.</p>
<p>While the upgrades do cost a few pennies to pick up (though they are included in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription), Digital Foundry thinks it's "worth it" to see just how remarkable these upgraded titles look on the new console.</p>
<p>First up is dynamic resolution, which is available on Switch 1, but the Switch 2's version has a higher range in both games to support 4K displays.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12249eada6850/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where dynamic resolution targeted 1600x900 on Switch 1 while docked, the Switch 2 release boosts that to a maximum of 2560x1440. There are dips in extreme cases, but these are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry did spot a few moments where the frames dipped randomly during cutscenes for no obvious reasons, but quickly corrected itself. And while the resolution boost and improved textures are fantastic across the board, there's a distinct lack (or lack of effectiveness) of anti-aliasing in both games.</p>

<p>Improved load times (some of which are more than halved) and shadow quality are two other highlights the outlet was keen to point out, but we want to focus on the frame rate and performance.</p>
<p>Focusing on Tears of the Kingdom first, Digital Foundry confirms what we all know — the game is running at 60fps for the most part, and stays pretty consistently up in those figures whether you're in battle or using Ultrahand. Testing only the first 6 hours of the game, DF noticed one tiny blip when building vehicles. A huge improvement from our experiences on Switch 1.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93a8df22abe6f/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Breath of the Wild is even more consistent, with busier areas like Kakariko and Zora's Domain put under the test with exploding barrels. These stay at a rock solid 60fps now.</p>
<p>So, it's an impressive rundown, with a few little caveats. While "rough points" do remain in both games, these two upgrades come with an easy recommendation from the tech specialists.</p>

<p>Former Bethesda dev had battled cancer</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Julian LeFay Passes away" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/203374220c1e6/julian-lefay-passes-away.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: OnceLost</em></figcaption></figure><p>Julian LeFay, the man often referred to as "the father of the <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong>" and co-founder of the indie developer OnceLost Studio, has passed away after a years-long battle with cancer. The announcement was made by his studio earlier today on social media. He was 59 years old.</p>
<p>LeFay was instrumental in the early days of Bethesda's RPG history, back when the likes of <strong>Daggerfall</strong> was laying the foundations for what was to come from the studio in the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/is-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Oblivion</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Skyrim.</a></p>
<p>In the post, OnceLost said that he was "not just a colleague, he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today."</p>

<p>LeFay numerous credits include programming lead on <strong>Arena</strong> and <strong>Battlespire</strong>, project lead on <strong>Daggerfall</strong>, as well as having credits on The Elder Scrolls Redguard and Morrowind.</p>
<p>He also worked as a composer and designer on games such as <strong>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</strong> (which came to NES) and music on the DOS <strong>Where's Wally?</strong> game.</p>
<p>LeFay's daughter also <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1948048790986051982">shared a poignant statement</a>, saying "Thank you for supporting his vision and giving him hope and strength until the end".</p>
<p>The studio addressed how this tragedy will affect work on its upcoming RPG, The Wayward Realms, and it's quite emotional reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. Julian's legacy will live on in every realm, every quest, and every moment of wonder that players will experience in The Wayward Realms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our thoughts are with LeFay's friends and family, and he will be missed by many in the industry.</p></section>
