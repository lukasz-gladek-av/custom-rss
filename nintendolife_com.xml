<p>"I can't really play it now though"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hideo Kojima has rightly cemented himself as a legend in the games industry, having created iconic titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">P.T.</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">Death Stranding</a>. Although it probably shouldn't come as a surprise, however, Kojima cites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> as the reason he started making games in the first place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA">new interview</a> with WIRED in which Kojima answers questions submitted online, he's asked which game he has played the most. His immediate answer was Super Mario Bros., claiming to have played it for "a year" when he was a college student. He states that "without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry".</p>
<p>Although he alludes to its simplicity (it was, after all, a launch title for the NES), he says that it pushed him to believe in the potential of games, claiming that "this medium would one day surpass movies".</p>
<p>Here's the full quote from Kojima:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Bros., definitely. Played it for a year. I was a college student. I skipped school to play at home. Without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry... Yeah... I can't really play it now, though.</p>
<p>"It's a side-scrolling action game. Mario just goes left to right. Basically just jumping. But there's a dash button. Using that and jump subtly changes the jump trajectory to attack or dodge. It has almost no story, but it felt like you were on an adventure. When I saw that, although it was pixel art with no story, I felt this medium would one day surpass movies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kojima has recently released <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and is currently working on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/physint">Physint</a> (working title). The original Death Stranding, initially a console exclusive for the PS5, has since been released on everything from the Xbox to the Amazon Luna, leading many to speculate that it might eventually wind up on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Mega Gyarados and Charizard Y join the fray</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>A major game update for the free-to-play Switch and mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_unite">Pokémon Unite</a> was released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, before we get to the end of the year, the development team has added Mega Charizard Y. This follows Mega Gyarados, which joined the fray earlier this month. Before this, trainers got Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Aeos coins have also been discontinued in Pokémon Unite. This took place earlier this month, alongside the introduction of License Journeys – giving trainers a new way to obtain Licenses in Unite.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-unite-is-discontinuing-aeos-coins-in-its-december-game-update">our previous story</a>, and below is the trailer for Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario:</p>

<p>Now, following this, it has provided an update about the lifetime sales of the series – revealing it has now sold over six million copies worldwide. This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/the-hd-2d-series-octopath-traveler-hits-another-sales-milestone">sales update in December last year</a>, when it hit the five million mark.</p>
<p>This latest sales update includes physical copies shipped and each game's digital sales. As part of this, it's also shared some special artwork, and the series will be on sale for a limited time.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler originally began life as a Switch exclusive in 2018 and now has multiple entries <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-pre-registrations-go-live-in-the-west">including a mobile prequel</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't tried out the new game yet, it allows you to be the hero (thanks to the custom character creator) and you're also tasked with restoring your hometown, which requires you to make use of the new townbuilding mechanic.</p>
<p>There is a demo available for this title as well and save data carries over to the full game. This follows an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/octopath-traveler-0-receives-a-small-update-on-switch-and-switch-2">update for Octopath Traveler 0 last week</a>.</p>

<p>"According to an internal GameStop memo"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ad41c8590c842"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad41c8590c842/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've got your eyes on the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle, you might want to get it sooner rather than later, as it's not going to be around forever.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1998845172046606767">reminder from Nintendo</a> earlier this month that it's still only available in "limited quantities", a GameStop memo has supposedly been issued that notes how this deal has now reached the end of its "lifecycle". Since then, GameStop has also <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2002874071525228771">shared a social media message</a>, mentioning once again that the bundle will "no longer be produced".</p>
<p>Here's what the internal memo says (<a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/2002812731108581597">via Nintendeal</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This bundle SKU has now reached end of lifecycle, and additional units will no longer be produced. Future replenishment of Nintendo Switch 2 will be the base console."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nintendo has previously mentioned how this bundle would be a "limited time production through Fall 2025" and was "available while supplies last". It was priced at $499.99 USD ($50 more than the standalone Switch 2 system), and was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/switch-2s-mario-kart-world-bundle-gets-a-surprise-sale-us">recently on sale in the US</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/2002814078834892816">Best Buy appears to still be offering this sale price</a>).</p>
