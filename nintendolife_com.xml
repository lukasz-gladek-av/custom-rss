<p>Following an update for NieR:Automata</p>

<p>After ongoing requests from players, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nierautomata-finally-lands-switch-2-compatibility-update">got a compatibility update</a> for the Switch 2 in November. With this game now functioning as it should on Nintendo's new hardware, another Square Enix title has now received a compatibility update.</p>
<p>This time it's for the role-playing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a>, which was originally released on the Switch eShop in 2022. While it might not be the <em>best</em> remaster in Square Enix's library, there are still fans out there who have been wanting to experience this title on the Switch 2 without any problems.</p>
<p>The good news is the issues associated with this game on Nintendo's hybrid system have now apparently been resolved. Since the arrival of the Switch 2, there were some start up issues, and while these didn't appear to be a massive problem for a lot of players, there were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1l7dtsz/comment/n0i7402/?share_id=l1E6CBXyyz7XxS7LSjCtZ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">some graphical glitches reported</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing is specifically mentioned on Nintendo's compatibility search page, as of 2nd December 2025, the game is now "supported" and the "game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch" on the Switch 2. The notes attached to this mention how the "previously identified issues have been resolved with an update".</p>

<p>This follows a handful of compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. Apart from NieR, several other titles received compatibility updates including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>. If you haven't already played the Radical Dreamers Edition of Chrono Cross, we said it was the "best and most convenient way" to relive this classic, despite its shortcomings in the remaster department.</p>

<p>This new patch brings all of the tweaks and additions made to other versions of the game (which we reckon is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">really very good</a>, actually) to Switch 1 and 2, so there's total parity across all versions.</p>
<p>That means the Switch releases have received the CPU Ranked Match mode, the new "Advance Win" feature — which allows you to call time on matches with huge leads (as well as some anti-cheat measures for online) — and a bunch of other tweaks and fixes to boot.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067utwjzh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The game's executive producer (and Level-5 CEO, lest we forget), Akihiro Hino, dropped the full deets <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1995815684304150948?s=20">on social media</a>, although we are still awaiting some more detailed patch notes. Here's the tweet, plus the machine translation below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest version of Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Victory Road has been updated. The versions are 1.4.0 and 1.4.1. Distribution will begin on each platform at various times. It will be after 9 PM for all platforms. The time may be subject to change.<br>
・Advance Win, Advance Time<br>
・First-time route unlock battle: Kizuna Star x5<br>
・AI ranked match<br>
And so on, including bug fixes, many new features will be implemented across platforms including Switch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this latest update, alongside 1.3's added ranked level cap and bug fixes, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is certainly in good shape, and looking and playing every bit the soccer star that it is!</p>
<p>The game launched back in the middle of November, and Ethan called it "the franchise’s most premium experience yet" in our recent review:</p>
