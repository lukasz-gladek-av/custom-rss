<p>Threading the needle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You've read the title, you've seen photos of the booths online, so you know it's coming — six years after its last official public demo, we've <em>finally</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. And, we've played it on Switch 2, too.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's special broadcast tomorrow, 21st August, we — or, more specifically, the lovely Felix — has spent some hands-on time with the highly-anticipated sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it's only about 15-minutes or so, but that's 15 minutes more than we had before. So, was it worth the two-hour-long wait? (Yes, <em>two</em> hours)</p>
<p>Of the two demos available — one from near the beginning of the game in a green area, and another later in the game in a magma-filled stage — Felix picked the second one. And, as we've already confirmed, there's a 120fps mode.</p>
<p>There's more dialogue (given that Hornet speaks), more collectible, and different movement options. And, of course, Felix took on the demo's big boss, Lace. So, it's more Hollow Knight with more features, at least for now.</p>
<p><em>So, if you want your first look at Silksong on Switch 2, here's the place for it — check out Felix's video up-top and then let us know if you're looking forward to Silksong in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s Jet</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section></header><section><p>Once upon a time, Jet-Ski games were all the rage. Arcade cabinets and fifth generation consoles were replete with these high-speed polygonal racers that sent you careening around tracks set in sunny locales with bobbing water physics. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_aqua_jet">Aqua Jet</a> was an early example of the trend and released the very same year as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/wave_race_64">Wave Race 64</a>. Now, you can play it in all its glory on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hamster Corporation has recently released two other classic Namco arcade titles on the new console in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Air Combat</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-aqua-jet">Aqua Jet</a> is just as lovingly curated as those games. In lieu of riding a replica personal watercraft, like the original cabinet offered, there's some nice feedback from the HD rumble and togglable gyroscopic controls. Elsewhere, there are widescreen format options and the ability to play both English and Japanese versions of the ROM.</p>
<p>There is such a wealth of customisation and ways to tailor your experience here that it's a shame the actual game doesn't warrant much of your time. Only two courses are available and unlocked from the start, with the advanced course being simply an extension of the normal course.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version features High Score and Time Attack modes, which offer some replay value, while a Caravan mode gives players a continuous five-minute block to set the best scores. You can also rewind if you're not happy with a turn.</p>
<p>The tracks still look great, with bright colours popping in both docked and undocked modes and an impressive sense of speed. Big jumps send you plunging underwater to catch a brief glimpse of the fauna, while whales and helicopters dart about at the periphery of the course.</p>
<p>Mirror variants and a goofy penguin mode can be unlocked with cheats detailed in the menus, but that’s still only two more versions of the same track. So unless you're a hardcore aquatic racing fan, or a big fan of the arcade original, this might not be the right game for you.</p>
<p>Aqua Jet offers one other nice feature in online leaderboards to keep you cracking away at course times, but with no multiplayer, there's barely any reason to revisit this once you're satisfied with your performance.</p>
<p>Still, Hamster has done another solid job bringing a '90s arcade classic to Switch 2 and making it sing. Unfortunately, without much content present in the base game, there are only so many times you can revisit this colourful racer before things get repetitive.</p></section></article><div><p>Ken Talbot has been playing games since they came in the form of cassettes.
