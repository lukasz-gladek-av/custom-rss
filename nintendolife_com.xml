<p>Posted across all of its relevant social media channels with the caption "Get your artifacts out. Lara's on her way...", the accompanying image showcases Turner donning the classic Tomb Raider costume from the earlier days of the franchise.</p>
<p>We can even see she's sporting those classic sunglasses and dual handguns, so this is a proper throwback!</p>
<figure data-uuid="c34023d7140ec"><a title="Lara Croft Main" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c34023d7140ec/lara-croft-main.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/primevideo/p/DTg5XIpEwmb/?hl=en">Amazon MGM Studios</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no release date for the new series yet, but we've already had confirmation that Turner will be joined by the likes of Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Martin Bob-Semple, and Bill Paterson. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who notably co-wrote <strong>No Time To Die</strong> and starred alongside Harrison Ford in <strong>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</strong>, is credited as the series' main writer and as executive producer.</p>
<p>Lara Croft is also set to return in two new games in 2026 and 2027. The first, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tomb_raider_legacy_of_atlantis">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, is a reimagining of her first adventure, while <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tomb_raider_catalyst">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a> will be a brand-new story in the chronology. Sadly, neither have been confirmed for Switch 2 at the time of writing.</p>

<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161476/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s tough to consider that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> came out almost six years ago, and even tougher to get over just how good it looks on Nintendo’s first hybrid system. Switch 2 hasn’t been left behind, though - now it’s got its own version of the game, but if I’m being honest, it's not really bringing all that much to the table.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:97166 @ 1768496404 -->
<p>The most notable change is the bump in resolution. It was pretty before, but now everything is rendered at a resolution much more befitting the Nintendo Switch 2, although some jagged pixel edges are still present. They’re oddly softer, though, which to my eye (which is admittedly only made of meat) suggests that one of the primary sources of the bumped-up res is Nintendo’s own flavour of DLSS upscaling. As I said, though, meat eyes.</p>
<p>Whatever the tech, the result is noticeable, especially when you get up close to your TV in docked mode. Realistically, the original still looked excellent, so it’s not a glow-up of epic proportions or anything. If you didn’t see a stark difference when you booted it up, I’d forgive you wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>But that’s with HDR off. If you turn it <em>on,</em> you’ll see a bigger difference than I was expecting. Colours are that much more vibrant, and colour banding on things like environmental shadows in water is almost entirely diminished. ACNH has always been a game with colours worth popping, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> makes said popping even poppier.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you’d missed the previous reveal, it’s still 30fps, unfortunately. Probably something to do with one of the game’s mechanics being tied to the frame rate, but a shame nonetheless.</p>
<p>And that’s not all! Although there isn’t an awful lot more left to discuss. Mouse controls allow you to decorate and arrange furniture within your home, the hotel, or the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">Happy Home Paradise</a> with a bit more ease, although it’s hardly a ‘power tool’. Bringing up <em>any</em> menu requires you to navigate with the standard controls again, which is a crying shame as we feel the ability to quickly whip through lists and drag and drop items into position would’ve been an easy win.</p>

<p>You can also use the mouse controls in custom designs, and those posts you can stick up outside Resident Services if you want. It’s nice that it’s been included, and if mouse controls were omitted, it definitely would’ve felt like a missed opportunity. But truthfully, Nintendo hasn’t realised the potential that mouse controls could have brought either.</p>
<p>You can have 12 people on your island in multiplayer now instead of the original’s eight, which is certainly an improvement - and now with GameChat and CameraPlay support. But personally I don’t think I could sit through that bloody plane landing sequence 11 times in a row for a single session.</p>
<p>That being said, loading times are certainly improved over the Switch 1. I’m not sure I’ve seen a single loading screen that hasn’t been shorter, though — for me — they felt just as they were when playing the Switch 1 version on Switch 2 before this 'Edition' dropped. I wasn’t able to see any significant difference between either on Switch 2, which makes sense at the end of the day, but if that’s all you care about, then you might not need to drop the cash for the upgrade any time soon.</p>

<p>Testing among Team NL, we found minor improvements, but also significant variations between our S2 load times (almost certainly down to how much each person has on their island), so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>The final inclusion is the megaphone, making its somewhat triumphant return from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a> on the 3DS, and it’s <em>fine</em>. You hold the 'A' Button, yell the name of a resident at your console, and if it understands you correctly, they’ll yell out in response, giving you an idea of where on your island they are, assuming they’re not indoors somewhere. It works fairly well, but it has to be said, it’s not exactly an exciting inclusion. Functional, yes, but do your neighbours really need to hear you scream "ANCHOVY!" at all hours?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is perfectly fine. It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features, but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade.</p>
<p>If it were free, I don’t think anyone could reasonably complain, but even at the relatively low price, it’s only <em>just</em> scraping by to be worthwhile. It’s far from an essential purchase, but if you’ve got credit on your account and you’re a fan of the game, you could do worse.</p></section>
