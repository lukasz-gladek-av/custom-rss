<p>"decades of prior art" may give developers the upper hand</p>

<figure><a title="Palworld" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca7b62b0f4aed/palworld.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Pocketpair</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's recent legal activity has caused quite the commotion online. One patent application relating to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">summoning of a so-called 'sub character'</a> has proven particularly controversial following its swift approval, with the broad nature of its contents having potentially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendos-patent-on-sub-characters-could-have-some-dire-ramifications">wide ramifications</a> on the games industry.</p>
<p>Now, in speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">Eurogamer</a>, Don McGowan, former Chief Legal Officer for The Pokémon Company, believes that the patent will likely just be ignored. His belief is that because there are countless examples of existing games utilising a summoning mechanic, Nintendo's patent simply won't hold up in court should it choose to launch an infringement lawsuit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art.</p>
<p>"This isn't Bandai Namco with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/12/youll_now_be_able_to_play_mini-games_during_loading_times">loading screen patent</a>".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg reckons that the mere existence of the patent may simply be enough to dissuade developers from implementing a summoning mechanic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The filing for such patent protection indicates that Nintendo does intend to pursue a legal strategy in defending itself against entrants in the pocket monster genre. But that strategy may or may not involve lawsuits, as the 'muddying of the waters' effected by the patents existence may be enough to deter investment in and creation of competitors. That is, if Nintendo looks like it could pounce, that may be enough. No actual pouncing required."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's a complex situation, then. It's admittedly tricky to really parse the language in the patent itself, but some of its descriptions and flowcharts do make specific mention of a 'ball' when summoning a sub character. If this is indeed the case, then perhaps developers don't need to fear a potential lawsuit so long as they refrain from implementing a 'Pokéball-inspired' feature.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if there are any tangible ramifications from Nintendo's patent, but it seems that Nintendo is utterly determined to win its case against Pocketpair and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/palworld">Palworld</a>.</p>

<p>Could a certain series make a return?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0ffb89a1c456/super-mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of Mario's 40th anniversary this week, NBCUniversal has apparently registered multiple 'Super Mario Galaxy Movie' domain names.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Direct broadcast is obviously taking place later today, and <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">this recent discovery has now led to speculation</a> about the title and theme of the upcoming movie and even future Mario movies. It seems to have also reignited hopes for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game entries to make a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>At this stage, nothing has been officially announced, so there's no guarantee these newly discovered registrations will lead to any confirmations or reveals.</p>

<p>There are also some theories floating around about this potentially being an <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">attempt to "throw" fans off the trail</a>. In saying this, it's still generating plenty of buzz being so close to Super Mario's anniversary and the latest Direct presentation. Adding some fuel to the fire is a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1966261624622416067">rumoured 'Old Spice' product leak</a> from earlier this year, which featured character renders as well as a title logo for 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie'.</p>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/super-mario-world-looks-to-be-the-official-name-of-the-next-mario-movie">finding in May on the official NBCUniversal website</a>, which suggested the next Mario Movie (due out in April 2026) would be titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>. However, the same web page removed the reference to this movie title not long after the news began circulating online.</p>
<p>When the follow up Mario Movie was originally announced in March 2024, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at the time how it would be "based on the world of the Super Mario Bros. series".</p>
