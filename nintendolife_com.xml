<p>More to come?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY">a new trailer</a> to provide an overview on how Switch 2 cartridges and Game-Key Cards work (just in case the last six or seven months' worth of discourse hasn't already clued you in).</p>
<p>In it, one of the examples showcased to demonstrate the Game-Key Card is none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, which has just been confirmed to launch on <strong>5th March, 2026</strong>. The title is being published by The Pokémon Company in Japan and Nintendo in the West, which makes this the company's first Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>Of course, the renders shown in the trailer clearly have a 'sample' watermark included, so there's a chance – however small – that the game may have just been plucked from thin air to demonstrate Nintendo's practices, but we think not. We reckon Pokopia is a full-blown Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean? Is this the start of something more? We can't be sure yet. Nintendo has previously gone on record to state that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">wouldn't use the medium for "Nintendo-developed titles"</a>, but that's the thing... This isn't a Nintendo-developed title – it's Omega Force (Koei Tecmo). But then if that's the case, then why didn't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> also receive a Game-Key Card release?</p>
<p>Lots of questions for now, and we'll be sure to push for answers going forward. But if you're someone who's dead set against Game-Key Cards, then you might want to strike Pokémon Pokopia off your wish list.</p>

<p>Plus, onn <strong>Thursday 13th November 2025 at 6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm BST</strong>, The Pokémon Company will be sharing a trailer for the 2026 Switch 2 exclusive (thanks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5ebdrj3xk24">Gematsu</a>!). There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbrs38Vf_jk">YouTube Premiere</a> already lined-up for the date one the Japanese YouTube channel. English trailers will probably be published shortly after the premiere begins.</p>
<p>In somewhat related news, Nintendo has also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY">published a trailer about Game-Key Cards</a>, and this trailer seems to suggest that Pokopia will be a Game Key-Card release. It does say SAMPLE over the top of it though, but it seems likely at this stage...</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjlymwn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Revealed during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pokemon-pokopia-looks-like-an-adorable-mix-of-minecraft-and-animal-crossing">September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, Pokémon Pokopia looks absolutely adorable. Bringing life-sim elements to the hugely popular franchise for the first time <em>ever</em>, it looks to blend <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders">Dragon Quest Builders</a>, and a ton of other cosy games.</p>
<p>It's a brand new direction for the series, and notably the very first Switch 2 exclusive for the Pokémon franchise. Digital pre-orders go live tomorrow, with physical pre-orders in Japan kick-off on 13th.</p>
