<p>Play like it's 1999</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive has called on physical distributor Limited Run Games to help out with its latest hard copy release. This time it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and apart from the standard physical version, there'll also be a classic "Big Box Edition" on offer.</p>
<p>This will be available for Switch, PlayStation 5 and PC and is priced at $69.99 (or your regional equivalent), with pre-orders opening on 22nd August 2025 and closing on 21st September 2025. This package comes with the game, a booklet (for console only), soundtrack, keychain and a double-sided poster. Here's a look:</p>

<p>The standard physical release available for Switch and PS5 will be priced at $39.99, with pre-orders opening and closing on the same date.</p>

<p>This game originally launched on Nintendo's eShop in July for $29.99 / Â£23.99, and we thought the remaster was the best way to play this sci-fi horror FPS. If we hear about anything else related to System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster physical release, we'll let you know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"System Shock 2's immersive mechanics will keep you hooked from start to finish, with Nightdive's enhancements and supplemental material providing ample bonus points. Now go play it, insect."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Here's the official comparison</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco recently confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a> to Nintendo platforms later this year, and it's now <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-details-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-frame-rate-and-resolution-official-comparison/">provided an official comparison</a> update on its Japanese website.</p>
<p>Here's how the new Unreal Engine 5 entry will supposedly perform on both the Switch and Switch 2. If we hear any developments about the game's performance and resolution for either platform between now and its November release, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, on Switch 2, the gameplay in Sparking! ZERO apparently runs at a maximum resolution of 810p (varying, depending on dynamic resolution) and is 30fps across both docked and portable modes. Additionally, this version of the game supports HDR.</p>
<p>As for the original Switch version, its gameplay will supposedly be "fixed" at 720p in docked and 480p in handheld, with both modes running at 30fps (although it's apparently "24fps in some menus").</p>
<p>The Nintendo versions of the game will also include local multiplayer and motion controls. There will be a Switch update as well for the physical and digital versions of the title, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco has also released some comparison screenshots of the Switch and Switch 2 versions which you can see below.</p>

</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bac07c3f2b59f/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has received a new update this week, bumping the Switch 2 exclusive up to Version 1.2.1.</p>
<p>This is the first update for August, and it's a small one compared to the previous updates, addressing some bug fixes. As usual, to continue playing online, you'll need to install this latest update.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's Japanese support page:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Version 1.2.1 (19th August 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where selecting "Ghost and Race" or "Watch Replay" immediately after downloading a ghost in "Time Attack" in "View Ranking" would cause a different Ghost to play than the one you downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need the latest updated data to play online elements.</p>
<p>If you download Ver. 1.2.1, you will not be able to use "local communication" and "LAN play" with users of Ver. 1.1.2 or earlier.</p>
<hr>
<p>If we hear anything else about this update, we'll be sure to let you know. The previous update, Version 1.2.0 included a bunch of adjustments and multiple bug fixes. You can find out more about this in our existing post here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>And if you want to learn more about Mario Kart World on the Switch 2, be sure to check out our review.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> is mostly known for regular retro soundtrack updates, but this week it's completely different, with the Japanese firm announcing we're actually getting some music from a game that's not even out yet.</p>
<p>It's songs from Masahiro Sakurai's upcoming release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Of course, this links up with the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-direct-revealed-for-tomorrow-19th-august-2025">Nintendo Direct, which is airing later today</a> and will run for a <em>whopping</em> 45 minutes.</p>
<p>This "special release" also happens to be the first Nintendo Switch 2 song update for the Switch Online music app.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We don't know what exactly to expect from Kirby Air Riders just yet, but last week, Sakurai mentioned how he was aware fans hadn't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/we-might-be-getting-an-update-about-sakurais-new-kirby-game-soon">even seen gameplay footage yet</a>. The latest Direct announcement follows on from a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">recent classification for the title</a> as well, with the game currently scheduled to launch at some point <strong>2025</strong>.</p>
