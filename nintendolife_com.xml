<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160473/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2021, publisher Skybound Games put out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/before_your_eyes">Before Your Eyes</a> on PC and Mac (later on mobile and PSVR2), which offered an innovative control mechanic in which you primarily interacted with the game through eye movement and blinks. Alongside this cool gimmick, Before Your Eyes was lauded for its gripping emotional story, quickly turning it into an indie favourite that garnered a passionate following.</p>
<p>Now, the developers at GoodbyeWorld Games have created a spiritual sequel called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a>, which both builds on some of the themes of its predecessor and introduces some cool ideas of its own. Though it currently lacks the eye control feature on Switch 2 (a Camera update is planned "sometime after launch"), it still proves a worthwhile narrative experience.</p>
<p>Goodnight Universe places you in the role of Isaac, an infant with the mind of a grown man and psychic powers, born to an unremarkable and ordinary nuclear family. Isaac can babble and cry and do all the things that a normal baby can do, but every now and then he causes a little chaos by flexing his psionic abilities in ways that confuse, frighten, and delight those around him who haven’t caught on and believe that Isaac is simply just a ‘normal’ baby.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160469/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet there’s, of course, the lingering mystery of <em>why</em> Isaac can do these things, and the plot naturally thickens once he catches the attention of the Aio Corporation, a tech company which seems to have some understanding of Isaac’s powers and has its own agenda for how to utilise them.</p>
<p>While the twists throughout the relatively brief (~four-hour) narrative are certainly intriguing, this is ultimately a soulful and heartwarming tale about the importance of family and the finite nature of time. As Isaac narrates his experience, you’re getting a first-row seat to all the ups and downs of ordinary family life, and not all of it is pretty.</p>
<p>In one instance, you’re witnessing a wholesome interaction between Isaac’s sister, Cleo, and his dad, while in another you’re tuning in to his dad’s private thoughts while he reads a bedtime story and learning of various insecurities and concerns he struggles with as the family's main provider. Domestic life can be messy in so many beautiful ways, and Goodnight Universe does a great job of showcasing this while keeping things interesting with the goofy antics of its primary protagonist.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155048/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>While there are some key moments in which you can express yourself and choose <em>slightly</em> diverging routes for a given scene, this is a largely linear tale that plays out somewhat like an interactive Pixar movie. Every now and then, you’ll get to choose something — such as whether Isaac responds with happiness or sadness to what another character said or did — and this leads to a few unique lines of dialogue, but there aren’t any bigger moments that lead to completely separate paths and different routes.</p>
<p>Some may be disappointed by this, but I appreciated the single-minded nature of the narrative, as it allows you to more easily immerse yourself, rather than keep stepping out to determine which route might be more interesting.</p>
<p>Gameplay follows the structure of a simple point-and-click adventure game in which you primarily scan the environment for the next interactable object or person needed to move the scene forward. Sometimes you’re given a neat checklist to follow with multiple objectives, while others you must intuit what’s next based on what the characters are doing.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160476/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Isaac can read minds and manipulate objects from afar, leading to all sorts of mischief as you innocently poke and prod at the world, leaving those around you bewildered as dishes seemingly wash themselves and toys aren’t found in the same places they were left.</p>
<p>There are some light puzzles to solve every now and then, but progression is basically a matter of identifying the correct object you need to manipulate in the environment and then doing the action needed to make it move or dance or fly across the room.</p>
<p>You do gain a few new abilities as the narrative progresses and Isaac gets more of a handle on his powers, but it’s very rare that the path forward isn’t made obvious either by the game literally telling you what to do next or very strongly hinting at it. Those of you who are looking for challenge won’t find it here, then, but the gameplay isn’t so braindead that you disengage.</p>

<p>Just like Before Your Eyes, the controls for Goodnight Universe feel designed around eye-tracking software for video cameras, but... well, the Switch 2 version doesn’t support this at launch. As a result, you’re left to navigate the interface using the right stick to move the cursor and camera, which often feels more tedious than I’d like. It’s the sort of control scheme that’s <em>fine,</em> but it feels clunky and unintuitive, which tends to take you out of the narrative that’s clearly trying to place you in Isaac’s shoes.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t say that stick controls are a dealbreaker, it’s nonetheless worth keeping in mind that you’re missing out on a key component of the intended game experience when playing it on console before the planned update arrives.</p>
<p>Visually, Goodnight Universe employs a simplistic but charming art style that leans well into the cartoonish absurdity of its protagonist’s abilities. The exaggerated proportions and environments vaguely call to mind the art style of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari</a> series, but there’s plenty of room for detailed character expression and smooth animation as scenes play out. Naturally, all this unfolds without any frame hitches or skips, highlighting the much-welcomed power boost that the Switch 2 hardware brings over its predecessor.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160470/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as the audio is concerned, music is sparsely utilized to punctuate scenes and elevate the atmosphere, often adhering to tracks that lean into the whimsy and sci-fi elements of the story. The music takes the backseat, however, to make room for the excellent voice acting, which significantly adds to the overall experience.</p>
<p>Not only are all the performances passionate and nuanced, but little details in the sound mixing contribute lots to the immersion, such as when listening to a character’s thoughts and hearing their internal monologue come at you from different ‘directions’. At boot up, you’re encouraged to play this game with headphones and I couldn’t agree more; the soundscape here is something you’ll want to pay lots of attention to.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Goodnight Universe is an enjoyable and quirky narrative adventure game that feels like a satisfying follow-up to the deeply emotional experience of Before Your Eyes. Isaac’s supernatural adventures are as entertaining as they are heartwarming, and though it isn't terribly long, it makes full use of every moment.</p>
<p>The only major drawback here is that the Switch 2 doesn’t support the eye and face tracking control style of the PC version at launch, which notably does take away somewhat from the core experience. All the same, I’d suggest you pick up Goodnight Universe if this one has already caught your eye. It provides a memorable narrative journey and is the sort of game that you’ll still be thinking about long after putting it down.</p></section>

<p>Kicking off later this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, it really is here — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, the soccer RPG from Level-5 which has seen multiple delays and <em>two</em> name changes, finally launches on 13th November 2025 on Switch and Switch 2. And ahead of that day, the developer has shared the first 30 minutes of the game's story mode.</p>
<p>The footage (above) is from the game's Story Mode, and as you can see, it's <em>very</em> story-heavy. There's not even any footie. But there's plenty to do as you explore the grounds of the school for the very first time.</p>
<p>Plus, one of the early highlights are the gorgeous animated cutscenes from MAPPA, the animation studio best known for its work on <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong>, <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> Season 4, <strong>Vinland Saga</strong> Season 2, and <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>.</p>
<p>You might have seen that some people are already playing the game online; that's because pre-orders for the PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions of the game grant Early Access to the game. That's <em>not</em> the case on Switch 1 or 2, unfortunately. So we'll have to wait until Thursday for a kickabout...</p>

<p>You might also be wondering about official reviews, too. We'll echo the words our sister site Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/site-news-wheres-our-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-ps5-ps4-review">shared yesterday</a>: we don't have a pre-release code.</p>
<p>And, as we'll be reviewing the Switch 2 version — which has Mouse Mode, along with better performance and visuals and other features — we also don't have access to... early access, so we won't be able to make a start until we get a code or until the game's officially out.</p>
<p>So, basically, we'll have a review for you as soon as we can, but as you're likely aware, this game is <em>massive</em>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1904a2299f646"><a title="romancing saga 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1904a2299f646/romancing-saga-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think it's fair to say we got a bit of an unexpected gift when Square Enix re-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">Romancing SaGa 3</a> for Switch back in November of 2019.</p>
<p>While it may not generate quite the same level of excitement as your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasies</a> (and that's understandable), Romancing SaGa 3 deserves any plaudits it gets for bringing a level of freedom and randomness to the RPG genre that was quite unique back in 1995. In fact, the whole series does.</p>
<p>With 3 in particular, we have a game that was bold, and still feels bold, in how it gave players a selection of eight protagonists to get stuck into the story with. Just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, and its (much better) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">sequel</a>, you can journey through Romancing SaGa 3's narrative multiple times thanks to the clever, criss-crossing storylines that make for a genuinely engrossing experience.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tsqzly&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>It helps that the actual story here is fairly strong as these things go to boot, with players assuming control of their chosen protagonist in the immediate aftermath of a Death Eclipse (or Morastrum), a horrifying event that occurs every 300 years that sees all newborns in the year of the Eclipse die, save for one, who becomes a Child of Destiny.</p>
<p>Right, I didn't come here to spoil the story, so that's enough of that. It's a cracker of a premise, and the game does a solid job of exploring it. Back in 1995, RPGs were very much still on-rails for the most part; they didn't allow for much in the way of "experimentation" in some of the ways that Romancing SaGa 3 does.</p>
<p>And it's experimentation that comes through allowing you to choose who to roll with, leading to events playing out from shifting perspectives, whilst also imbuing the whole endeavour with a striking sort of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laissez-faire">'laissez-faire'</a> attitude, thanks to levelling up systems that sort of just go "yeah, mate, eh...here, have some random boosts for your efforts." In true SaGa style.</p>

<p>Rather than being able to count on a fixed upgrade rate to any specific aspect of your character, here it's random all the way, and it feels great. There's a ramshackle sort of approach...perhaps ramshackle isn't quite the correct word as it feels organised, but there's certainly an attempt - and a successful one - to make things feel <em>organic</em>, to make the world feel like one you can inhabit and meander around in, rather than just blowing through in a straight, precise and calculated manner. So, maybe it allows <em>you</em> to approach <em>it</em> in a ramshackle manner is a more appropriate description.</p>
<p>The weapon "sparking" system (returning from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_2">Romancing SaGa 2</a>) continues this approach, which gives each of the characters the chance to gain new skills randomly as they fight. Whilst some players may not gel entirely with this I personally love it, and I think it's a system that enhances the organic vibe in a smart way, whilst also ensuring that you still upgrade and progress.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do agree it probably works to the detriment of the overall focus of the gameplay loops, and that's something picked up on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">in our 6/10 review</a> of the re-release. It can be frustrating and off-putting if you want to methodically improve and do the usual sort of RPG things with character progression. For me, though, it's successful in what it sets out to do with being a little bit free-wheeling, that the loss of some direction in the more traditional video game sense is acceptable.</p>
<p>I also love how the underlying ethos of all of this is carried into Kenjo Ito's soundtrack for the game. Again here, rather than have a plan or specific theme in mind, the composer approached it with the idea of allowing its sound to develop and evolve over time. It's all very zen, lads.</p>
<p>Have a happy birthday, Romancing SaGa 3. I'd ask you if you'd planned anything, but I don't see that being your style.</p>
