<p>Kiki's Bakery Service</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Silver Lining Interactive and developer Sunny Lab are bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchs-bakery">The Witch's Bakery</a> to Switch 2 in addition <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witchs_bakery">to Switch</a>, with the cosy RPG arriving on both consoles in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine opening a bakery in modern-day Paris — not easy, right? Well, as Lunne the witch, that's exactly what you're doing. But this slice-of-life adventure is more than just making Mont Blancs and macarons; being a witch, Lunne has the ability to see inside people's hearts and heal their emotions. Anyone getting some <strong>Kiki's Delivery Service</strong> vibes from the premise alone?</p>
<p>The game is split into three parts — during the day, you're running your bakery, fulfilling customer requests and managing a small group of staff. In the evening, you get to explore Paris, make friends, and also solve problems by using Lunne's aforementioned magical ability. At night, you can decorate your bakery, practise your magic skills, or just relax.</p>
<p>And all of these activities get your experience and money, as well as build relationships and make new friends. But Paris is also home to many shops and unique districts, so make sure you spend time running around the most beautiful city in the world.</p>

<p>And goodness, somehow we haven't talked about the beautiful hand-drawn visuals yet: The Witch's Bakery looks gorgeous, with 2D character models that look like they've come straight out of an anime on 3D-esque backdrops. Paris has never looked more stunning, we think.</p>
<p>In addition to a digital release, Silver Lining has also confirmed it will be releasing a physical version for both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — the latter appears to be a Game-Key Card — for <strong>£29.99 / $34.99 / €34.99</strong>. Pre-orders are opening now <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/search?q=the+witch%27s+bakery&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">on Silver Lining Direct</a>.</p>
<p>We know there's a lot of cosy games on Nintendo's consoles, but the visuals and unique mix of gameplay elements make The Witch's Bakery stand out to us. It looks lovely, and we can't wait to see more later in the year.</p>

<p>Out alongside Meetup in Bellabel Park on Switch 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> is coming out very soon — as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-arrives-on-switch-2-in-march">just announced</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> — but that's not the only upgrade coming to the 2023 GOTY-nominated platformer.</p>
<p>Three brand new amiibo will be released on the same day as the Switch 2 upgrade, <strong>26th March 2026</strong>. The line-up features Elephant Mario, Poplin &amp; Prince Florian, and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower. Yes! Captain Toad <em>finally</em> has an amiibo!</p>
<p>Prices haven't been announced yet, but given the increase as of the Switch 2 generation, they'll likely be on the more expensive side. Here's a little look at them:</p>

<p>What do they do in-game? They'll give you free power-up items if you scan them in while you're in any course.</p>

<p>Rosalina Returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-has-been-rated">rating</a> earlier this month, Nintendo has today given us another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a>, accompanied by a release date of <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases a bunch of new features that will be arriving in the 2023 platformer. First up is the Game Room Plaza, a location for some multiplayer mayhem which will offer six different 'attraction' minigames to be played either locally or online with up to 12 people.</p>
<p>The Toad Brigade occupy a new area called 'Camp Central', where you can participate in training challenges to hone your skills, earn patches, and raise your Brigade ranking.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us another look at the Koopalings! These notorious baddies have stolen the Bellabel Flowers and scattered them across the map, so add that to the list of collectables as you make your way across the levels.</p>
<p>And speaking of familiar faces, Rosalina is available as a playable character in this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition! You can even control a Luma as a 'co-star' in co-op, where Mouse Mode is an option.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the trailer wraps up with the big reveal that three (yes, <em>three</em>) Wonder amiibo will be launching alongside the Switch 2 Edition on 26th March — Prince Florian fans, rise up!</p>
