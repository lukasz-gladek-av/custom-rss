<figure data-uuid="010b934aad0e4"><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/010b934aad0e4/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/switch-2-exclusive-drag-x-drive-scores-its-second-major-update-heres-whats-included">a rather beefy update earlier today</a>, and to coincide with Patch 1.2.0's release, Nintendo has dropped a series of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-1/">Ask the Developer interviews</a> with the lead trio.</p>
<p>Yoshinori Konishi (director and programming director), Hiroki Hamaue (programmer), and Takahisa Ikejiri (art director) sat down to share their experience in coming up with this unique online multiplayer title, which is controlled entirely with the Switch 2's Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-1/">part 1</a>, Konishi shares that the game was inspired by "sports such as wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, BMX and skateboarding", particularly the former. So much so that the team actually made time to try playing wheelchair basketball in real life</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytepMKq3hLRsg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0opxyrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Hamaue had previously rode a wheelchair "for a research project back when I was a student", but for Konishi and Ikejiri, the first time they got to experience wheelchair basketball was at an experience in Osaka.</p>
<p>In terms of prep, "No one on the team had used a wheelchair on a daily basis, so we began by gathering up reading materials so we could learn more about it", Konishi detailed. "From an encyclopedia of wheelchairs to videos and essays by wheelchair athletes and even manga about basketball or wheelchairs, we pulled together as much reference material as we could lay our hands on and studied it together."</p>

<p>The team even bought an everyday wheelchair and sports wheelchair, the latter of which was important for designing the vehicle in-game thanks to its angled wheels. But the problem was the team couldn't really test them out in open spaces, because the project — and Switch 2, <em>and</em> Mouse Mode — were "highly confidential".</p>
<p>"We were restricted to the small space inside the office and could only let loose down the hallway once everyone else had gone home for the day. (Laughs)" Konishi reflects.</p>
<p>Talking about the wheelchair basketball experience, Ikejiri said that he "wasn't prepared for how difficult it was to shoot the ball" as the hoop is at the same height as a standard basketball game. "But since you take the shot sitting down, my shot didn't reach the basket at all."</p>
<p>"Maneuvering a wheelchair is difficult unless you get the hang of when to apply and release force," Hamaue added, "You can't just propel yourself along smoothly in a single stroke. But it cemented for me how deep the controls are".</p>

<p>In addition to trying out wheelchair basketball themselves, the team also had the opportunity to allow wheelchair basketball players to try out the prototype.</p>
<p>Konish said that this provided valuable insight for Drag x Drive, "Because the players use wheelchairs in their daily lives, they were all really good at turning and moving backwards in the game. Of course, we learned a lot about the controls, but we gained even more insights watching them think about what to do on the court as they played."</p>
<p>Hamaue adds to this that "seeing actual wheelchair basketball players get the hang of the game and its controls so quickly confirmed to us that it could work well as an intuitive control scheme." You can even see the team try out some movements themselves in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-2/">Part 2 of the interview</a>, including tilting.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-3/">three parts</a> contain video clips and test footage of Drag x Drive's development, and are worth reading through, especially if you're interested in checking out the new update.'</p>
<p>Since its release in August 2025, Drag x Drive has received two free updates — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-2-exclusive-drag-x-drive-scores-first-major-update-includes-local-wireless-games-and-much-more">the first added</a> wireless multiplayer while the second added a Survival Tag mode.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/one-of-the-best-looking-games-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-dives-into-metroid-prime-4</link>
            <guid>1370428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>If you can believe it, we are very, <em>very</em> nearly at the official launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. It's a cross-generation release, but we always knew that this was going to be a big player for the Switch 2, making the most of the new hardware's beefed-up specs to squeeze the most out of the space adventure. The question is, how does it hold up?</p>
<p>Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVJ_P6dzFg">Digital Foundry</a> are here to answer just that. In the above video, the tech experts break down everything you need to know about the game's performance, and we've got the full rundown for you to read through below. So, let's dive right into it.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the visuals, DF states that the game is "truly beautiful". With crisp visor reflections, rain droplets and light peeking through cracks, the game is packed with more detail than ever before, and it's used to great effect.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, we all know that MP4 offers two different options — 'Performance' and 'Quality' — though, according to Digital Foundry, things are a bit more nuanced in actuality. In Quality, the visor 'frame' and main image appear to be rendered separately, and while the real meat of what you're looking at "generally does read as a native 4K image", it's still "very much 1440p" (1080p in handheld). The sharpness is right where you'd want it, though, with DF calling it "the best image quality I've seen from a Nintendo game on Switch 2 thus far".</p>
<p>'Performance' mode drops the resolution down to 1080p (720p in handheld), giving everything a slightly softer look. That said, the presentation remains "sharp enough" and is still sharper and clearer than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> was on Switch 1 by a "significant margin".</p>
<p>But what about the much-discussed frame rate? You'll be pleased to hear that the 120fps promise (in the relevant mode) is delivered on, locking to 120, and holding it "with complete consistency" — bar the very odd, tiny dip when riding around the open world. And yes, the same level of smoothness applies to the 60fps mode.</p>
<p>The truly "mind-blowing" feature, according to DF, is the HDR, which stacks up as "one of the finest HDR presentations I've seen in years, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best". So, expect those highlights to pop, and the shadows to deepen in docked. The same can't be said for handheld, mind you, where the Switch 2's native screen can't keep up.</p>
<p>And finally, the load times are right where you'd want 'em, with door opening times much reduced from the previous entries.</p>
<p>You can find the full tech review in the above video or over on <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">Digital Foundry's new site</a>. As for us, we were absolutely blown away by MP4, calling it "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> — read all about it below.</p>

<p>Reviews for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> are live, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">including ours</a>, although you may have noticed that it's focused on the Switch 2 Edition, and MP4 is <em>also</em> launching on Switch 1.</p>
<p>If you're looking for impressions on the original Switch version, they are coming - please bear with us. We weren't able to test on the older hardware prior to the review embargo, but we do now have access and we'll be posting our Switch 1 review just as soon as we're able to give it a thorough look.</p>
<p>It's been a long ol' wait since the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/06/metroid_prime_4_confirmed_for_nintendo_switch_but_retro_studios_isnt_involved">revealed back in 2017</a>, and with development restarting from scratch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/01/metroid_prime_4_development_scrapped_will_be_restarted_alongside_retro_studios">in 2019</a>, everyone's understandably itching to find out every last detail about how Retro Studios' return to the Metroid universe holds up <em>on the hardware it was announced for</em>.</p>
<p>The NS2 Edition cart also works on your original Switch, so we're as eager as you to see how it compares to the 4K, 120fps version Ollie's been enjoying.</p>
<p>So, watch this space, and we'll get our verdict live as soon as we can.</p>
