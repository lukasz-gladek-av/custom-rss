<figure><a title="HORI Wireless HORIPAD Turbo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a40167a4511b7/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer HORI has lifted the lid on its latest licensed Switch 2 controller, the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Wireless HORIPAD Turbo</a>. It's a colourful affair, with an overall design that looks uncannily close to Nintendo's official offering, but there are a couple of caveats that stop it from <em>quite</em> toppling the mighty Pro Controller.</p>
<p>But let's start with the positives. The Wireless HORIPAD Turbo boasts TMR sticks to reduce chances of the dreaded drift, full gyro control, mappable face and back buttons, a C Button, and a neat 'Button Lock' function to prevent you from accidentally hitting any of the middle buttons (+, -, Home and Screenshot) during particularly sweaty online matches. It also comes with its own HORI Button in the middle, which can be used for rapid inputs and setting up profile preferences.</p>
<p>A pretty appealing line-up, no? The black model cuts a very similar silhouette to Nintendo's Pro Controller (and is a drastic improvement over HORI's <a href="https://hori.co.uk/nsx-005/">wired counterpart</a>, if you ask us), but the Wireless Turbo offers a little bit of colour variation in its full lineup, with 'Aqua Cyan', 'Frost White', 'Shine Yellow' and 'Ruby Magenta' designs all available.</p>


<p>Naturally, this <em>isn't</em> a Pro Controller, so there are a few missing features in the Wireless Turbo if you're after a pad with the full range of Nintendo abilities. Like many third-party pads, this offering cannot be used to wake the Switch 2 from sleep, and there's no support for reading your amiibo. What's more, the Wireless Turbo doesn't contain an audio jack, and there's no HD Rumble either.</p>
<p>All that said, the Wireless HORIPAD Turbo <em>does</em> come at a cheaper price than the Pro Controller. The pad is currently listed on the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Japanese HORI website</a> for 7,980 yen (around £40 / $54), with a 'Winter 2025' release date. Of course, there's no guarantee that this price conversion will match the <em>actual</em> regional retail prices, but that's a good chunk cheaper than the £74.99 / $89.99 asking price for Nintendo's official offering.</p>
<p>The pad is now available to pre-order in Japan, so we can't imagine that a Western release will be far behind. If you want an even closer look at the colour range, you'll find HORI's 13-minute video rundown of the collection below.</p>

<figure><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0cf0e382505e/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A recent online post from the US Department of Homeland Security has prompted calls from angry fans for The Pokémon Company to initiate legal action against the US federal department.</p>
<p>If you've somehow missed it, the post — <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530">entitled 'Gotta Catch 'Em All'</a> — contains a video mixing the Pokémon anime's famous intro with footage of law enforcement agents handcuffing and detaining people.</p>
<p>The use of the Pokémon IP to promote the wave of recent, controversial arrests by ICE agents in the US has some fans calling on the IP owners to take legal action, with replies <a href="https://x.com/LordFemto725/status/1970703790773813509">tagging official accounts</a> on X and <a href="https://x.com/Melb0urne__82/status/1970354243941867594">referencing Nintendo's notoriety</a> as a litigious company protective of its brands.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fylgivk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">speaking with IGN</a>, The Pokémon Company's former Chief Legal Officer Don McGowan says that he believes a lawsuit is unlikely, mentioning specifically the green-card status of many of TPC's executives in the US and a general aversion to publicity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't see them doing anything about this for a few reasons. First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p>
<p>"Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referencing Pokémon's famous catch phrase, the minute-long video plays the theme tune to the '90s anime in its entirety, cutting between clips from the intro featuring Ash Ketchum and footage of doors being blown open with explosives.</p>
<p>'Department of Homeland Security' appears in a font similar to the Pokémon logo, followed by blurred footage of Border Patrol agents detaining people. A number of Pokémon TCG-style card mock-ups are shown at the end, displaying convicted individuals with a weakness to Ice-type.</p></section>
