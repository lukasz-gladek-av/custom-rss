<p>It's the Obstagoon Parade!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company is back with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion of 2026, and it's a <em>fantastical</em> one.</p>
<p>The 'Fantastical Parade' set launches on <strong>28th January</strong> at <strong>5pm PST / 1am GMT (29th) / 2am CET (29th)</strong>, featuring none other than Gardevoir on the cover. This one throws in a couple of new Mega ex cards for Gardevoir, Mawile and Teal Mask Ogerpon, as well as a particularly fetching full art card of Falinks.</p>
<p>The above trailer provides a pretty decent overview of what we can expect from the expansion, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>Fantastical Parade will also see the introduction of Stadium cards into TCG Pocket, which, much like the regular card game, can apply effects over the entire battle.</p>
<p>With just one week until this one arrives, it might be a good time to start saving your Pack Hourglasses.</p>

<p>35% more than the PS4</p>

<figure data-uuid="a3865a73ba47d"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3865a73ba47d/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 ended 2025 with a total of <strong>4.4 million units</strong> sold in the US, according to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczduu7kxc2b">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>
<p>This means that after its seventh month on the market, Nintendo's new system is still the fastest-selling home console in US history. Piscatella noted afterwards that the Game Boy Advance is the overall winner in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this means that the Switch 2's install base is nearly double that of its predecessor after the same amount of time. It's also roughly 35% ahead of the PS4 over the same amount of time, which was remarkably popular when it launched back in 2013.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's sales had slowed down somewhat over the Christmas period, falling by around 35% compared to the original Switch during the same period. It seems, however, to have had little effect on the console's overall performance.</p>
<p>Concerns around potential price rises persist as the US grapples with tariffs and the rapid rise of AI, but overall, it seems Nintendo's new console is off to the best start we could have possibly hoped for.</p>

<p>Save the date, bub</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> will launch on the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>22nd May 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The new sequel, developed by Fabraz (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>) will also get a 'Pawsome Edition' physical release on both consoles, containing the game itself, a deluxe box, a poster, an artbook, and a manual. Atari is seemingly implying that, much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, the physical release on Switch 2 is <em>not</em> a Game-Key Card but rather a full on-cart release.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, a digital copy of Bubsy 4D will set you back <strong>$19.99</strong>. The physical edition on Switch is <strong>$39.99</strong>, while the release on Switch 2 is <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, I’m on a mission to take back the Golden Fleece from those nasty BaaBots who snatched it right out of my paws. I’ll run, jump, glide and roll across alien planets with platforming purrfection, tackling vibrant fabric- and craft-themed levels, with each planet ending in a BaaBot boss battle. Dress me up in stylish new outfits, collect hidden blueprints to unlock new moves and race against other players’ ghost data in online time trials. Along the way, I’ll reunite with furmiliar friends like Terri, Terry, Virgil and Oblivia - all to a pawsitively funky soundtrack by Fat Bard."</p>

<p>Bubsy has had his fair share of criticism in the past. Most recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> received a score of 4/10 from us earlier in 2025, in which we described the included games as being "frustrating and painful to play".</p>
<p>With Frbraz at the helm, however, we're confident Bubsy 4D will be much better.</p>
