<figure><a title="The House of the Dead 2: Remake 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829dbc3fb109d/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>An arcade light gun classic is coming out on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> as Forever Entertainment's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a> brings zombies, bullets, and gore to Switch. The game was originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/house-of-the-dead-2-remake-blasts-onto-switch-this-spring">aiming for Spring</a>, but we're a little past that at this point!</p>
<p>Taking on the role as either James Taylor or Gary Stewart, you'll be blasting your way through a city that's been overrun by, well, the dead, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>The remake brings updated graphics and remastered music (and the ability to swap to the old music), but remains pretty faithful to the 1998 original. You can blast through the Classic Campaign, Boss Mode, or a Training Mode either on your own or with a buddy — the Gary to your James, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">first remake</a>, this one's being developed by MegaPixel Studio; unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-remake">we didn't love our time with the first game</a> back when it launched in 2022, as it was plagued with control and performance issues. Let's hope things are fixed for the sequel, which we have fond memories with on the Dreamcast.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/422efc4616565/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Oof</em>, well this has been <em>quite</em> the day for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> content, eh? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">spotlight Direct</a> was absolutely jam-packed with DK goodness, revealing some familiar faces, highlighting a bunch of gameplay mechanics and announcing enough collectibles to make even the most tentative completionist break out in a sweat. On top of all that, we've also got a new batch of screenshots — like we said, what a day!</p>
<p>The freshly-baked screens cover a lot of the same ground that you will have seen in the Direct, but it's a nice chance to stop for a minute and <em>really</em> soak up some of the details. Scrolling through them got us feeling sufficiently pumped for the game's <strong>17th July</strong> release date, and we thought it would be only fair to share them all with you lovely lot too.</p>
<p>So, let's check out some of these sweet snaps, shall we? Starting with the surprise reveal that started it all: Pauline!</p>

<p>And how about those vistas? Just imagine the punching potential...</p>



<p>Next, let's have a look at the three Bananza Transformations, which will see DK morph into a giant gorilla, a speedy zebra and a flying ostrich, each with its own special abilities:</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184091 @ 1750290613 -->
<p>We've got a handful of gameplay screenshots too, so you can see what exploration and Challenge Courses will look like when treated to some HUD magic:</p>


<p>And we haven't forgotten about you menu fans, either. We'll round things out with a closer look at the in-game map, the DK Art mode, and a handful of shop and Skill Point menus:</p>

<hr>
<p>We're imagine we'll hear a little more from Donkey Kong Bananza before it swings its way to Switch 2 on 17th July, but for now, at least, you can consider us sufficiently hyped!</p>
