<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155170/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>In many ways, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> feels like the culmination of everything Hazelight Studios has accomplished in the co-op space.</p>
<p>The journey began with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brothers_a_tale_of_two_sons">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</a>, a charming fantasy that required solo players to coordinate both thumbs to control two characters simultaneously. The studio then progressed to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/a_way_out">A Way Out</a>, a jailbreak caper that introduced several clever mechanics for two players, including the now-standard Friend's Pass system (more on that later). With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, Hazelight pushed things even further, delivering a big adventure with a well-written, emotionally resonant story and great characters.</p>
<p>Now comes Split Fiction, a near-flawless dual odyssey that perfects the studio's formula and delivers an epic experience of staggering variety. The game’s many co-op trials might put your strongest relationships to the test, but you will never stop having fun.</p>

<p>The story is, fittingly, about stories. Mio and Zoe are two aspiring writers lured to the shady tech giant Rader Publishing by the promise of a no-strings book deal. Upon arrival, they’re suited up in <strong>Tron</strong>-like bodysuits and instructed to enter a set of strange, floating bubbles. Mio hesitates and, after a brief struggle, ends up inside Zoe’s bubble. They awaken inside the physical manifestation of their combined imagination. The two unlikely companions must survive their own ideas, while trying to stop Rader from stealing their IP.</p>
<p>The adventure unfolds across two vastly different mindscapes, built from the main characters' chosen theme. Mio’s choice of fiction is cyberpunk-style sci-fi, while Zoe prefers cosy fantasy. These contrasting settings give Hazelight the perfect excuse to drop partners into dramatically different environments that demand teamwork, creative problem solving, and synchronised playstyles.</p>
<p>At its heart, Split Fiction thrives on this collision of two distinct genres, using the stylistic clash as a narrative engine to drive inventive cooperative gameplay. The plot is built to sustain momentum; Mio and Zoe are constantly plunged into tense, in-media-res scenarios that keep the action moving and the players engaged.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155174/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>After a brief introduction at Rader Corp, our deuteragonists are thrown straight into chaos, first piloting a spaceship in a frantic battle, then fleeing from a horde of giant ogres. Soon after, they’re swinging across the rooftop of a futuristic nightclub and bouncing around as a pair of pigs in a (surprisingly dark) fairytale scenario. This all happens in the opening chapter.</p>
<p>Each world is packed with elaborate set pieces, and the action rarely lets up. Mio and Zoe leap from one high-energy scenario to the next, pausing only occasionally for charming, character-driven moments that deepen their bond. Slowly bringing these two contrasting archetypes together in the middle of all this action is a storytelling masterstroke, one that pays off in the game's phenomenal final act.</p>
<p>So, what do you actually do in Split Fiction? What genre is it? The answer, quite simply, is all of them. It’s a puzzle game, a shooter, a brawler, and a platformer, sometimes all within the same level. Across its lengthy main story, there’s a little bit of everything. This grab-bag format means that you have a consistent grasp on what you will have to do next.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156753/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The only drawback is that, by its very nature, the game doesn't linger on any one activity for long. That’s unfortunate, because many of its ideas are strong enough to support a full game on their own.</p>
<p>Each chapter grants the aspiring writers a unique ability, and most of the level’s progression is built around using that power in creative ways. Often, both players are required to perform different tasks simultaneously, making strong communication and patience essential. These challenges never feel overwhelming, and the game’s generous checkpoint system ensures that frustration is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>There are still moments that will really test the patience of you and your partner. Faster-paced sequences, like high-speed chases or boss fights, are often hilarious exercises in trial and error.</p>

<p>What makes Split Fiction exceptional is the sheer variety of challenges you face. There are hundreds of mechanically distinct minigames spread across this adventure and every single one feels thoughtfully crafted. Alongside the linear main story, optional side quests offer wild artistic swings and some of the most difficult activities in the game.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus of this solid Switch 2 port is that it's a nice showcase of the console's capabilities, with the exception of mouse control, which is unfortunately missing.</p>
<p>Firstly, it looks great. This is a gorgeous game, with a vibrant art style and busy environments that often move at breakneck speeds. Performance remains stable throughout, with a locked 30fps that has only the slightest of stumbles in handheld mode for some of the bigger set pieces. It would be nice to have 60fps, but it runs incredibly well with the lower frame rate.</p>
<p>The big feature here is the Friend's Pass system. Like previous Hazelight titles, two separate consoles can share a single copy of the game. This time, too, you can use Switch 2 and Nintendo’s GameShare feature to host a session that an original Switch can join. This not only offers incredible value but also ensures that co-op partners who don’t own the new console aren’t left out. As it's running from the host console and not an installed version of the game, the performance on the OG Switch can be a tad unpredictable, but it's mostly steady.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156750/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside GameShare — and the option to play local splitscreen and online — there’s also crossplay, so there’s a generous number of ways to play with others.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is a singular experience, one that you'll want to jump right back into after the credits roll. It's the crowning achievement of Hazelight, a studio whose every release is becoming a notable event. It's also a great time on Switch 2 and ranks among the very best of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">the launch lineup</a>.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Split Fiction feels like a gift. Its sole aim is to entertain and bring players together by testing them at every turn. Hazelight gives us two distinct worlds, each filled with a huge array of activities for co-op partners to enjoy and argue over. It serves as a surprising visual showcase for the Switch 2 and enhances the Friend's Pass feature, allowing our original Switch buddies to join in the fun.</p></section>

<p>A brand new world?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a4e4c23e4d38/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is finally out, making it the first proper new mainline entry in over a decade. Chances are if you've bought a Switch 2, then you've probably bought Mario Kart World too, so we're eager to see exactly what you make of it so far.</p>
<p>Before we do, however, let's just remind ourselves of what we thought. Alana provided the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">big review</a> for the game and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At first, this doesn't quite feel like the reinvention of Mario Kart that people wanted or expected, but the more time you spend in the open world and racing with friends, you’ll uncover a mechanically rich kart racer full of secrets and joy. Mario Kart World refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Few games have brought me as much laughter as Mario Kart World has done since launch. If you need a pick-me-up, this game is sure to bring a smile, and it feels like a perfect start to Switch 2's life."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749825416 -->
<p>At the time of writing, Mario Kart World is currently sitting at 87 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-kart-world/">Metacritic</a>, which means that it's currently viewed as 'generally favourable' from a total of 75 critic reviews.</p>
<p>So now it's over to you. While we think it's unlikely you've completed 100% of the game with every possible secret uncovered, we imagine you've probably experienced all of the tracks by this point and have a solid understanding of the its many quirks.</p>
<p>Still, your chosen score isn't written in stone. Feel free to give it a preliminary verdict now and revisit at a later date. Alternatively, you can always come back here if you feel you simply can't provide a score just yet. So cast your verdict in the below poll and let us know exactly what you think of Mario Kart World after just over one week.</p>

<p>You're probably not meant to do that</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="delivery driver throws switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f6d199b6a5f9/delivery-driver-throws-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's a hectic old time, is this new console business. There are new games, new hardware, new bits and bobs of every description to read up on, buy and, if you're a delivery driver, to get safely from warehouse to customers' homes. Of course, not all delivery drivers are built the same or employ the same techniques to ensure that your goods — in this case a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>, apparently — arrive as they should.</p>
<p>For us, regardless of the package, well, we would assume most would adopt a fairly routine method of walking right up to the door and handing it over to whoever lives there, who in this case is likely waiting for a shot on Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>However, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/delivery_man_throws_my_nintendo_switch_2/">as seen on u/NintendoSwitch</a>, one gamer has apparently captured — via the magic of the humble doorbell camera — a delivery man using an entirely new method.</p>

<p>New skill unlocked! As you can see in the clip above, this particular technique involves throwing the parcel (hopefully they got some bubble wrap in there) in the general direction of a house.</p>
<p>This particular shot didn't make it all the way to the door, although it did fairly well. Maybe next time!</p>
<p>Happily, the poster also confirms <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/comment/mxfporg">a little down the comments</a> underneath their video that the Switch 2 was, box aside, quite remarkably fine!</p>

<p>A happy ending.</p>
