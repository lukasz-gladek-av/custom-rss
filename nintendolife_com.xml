<p>Return to the garden later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PopCap's highly addictive tower defence series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a> is making a return on the Switch and Switch 2 later this month.</p>
<p>Before you return to the garden in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted</a>, there's a new gameplay trailer you might want to check out. It showcases the Switch 2 GameShare feature, which allows you and a friend to enjoy Local Co-Op or PvP together.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the fine print in the trailer, the Switch 2 system must initiate the GameShare session. And users who receive software via GameShare can only play this software during the session it was shared.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b4736719262f"><a title="Plants vs Zombies Replanted" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b4736719262f/plants-vs-zombies-replanted.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the 'Replanted' version of the original Plants vs. Zombies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cult classic, Plants vs. Zombies, returns in glorious HD! After years in Crazy Dave’s attic, the original battle between Plants and Zombies is back—bigger, brighter and crazier than ever before. Revisit the epic backyard standoffs you remember, but this time with new levels, fresh twists, and 15 years of never-before-seen franchise history at your fingertips. Relive the glory days of Peashooters, Sunflowers, and brain-hungry chaos. Rejoin the ultimate garden defense and experience the backyard brawl that started a phenomenon—now back for a new era!"</p>

<p>From Z-A and beyond</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Not content with <em>only</em> releasing a new mainline game and tickets to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/a-new-pokemon-pop-up-store-is-coming-to-london-next-year">upcoming pop-up store</a> in October, The Pokémon Company is bringing even more monster-catching content to the UK in the coming weeks with a new series of the <strong>Pokémon Horizons</strong> anime.</p>
<p>Part one of the third season, subtitled 'Rising Hope', will arrive on BBC iPlayer on <strong>27th October</strong>, with more episodes following in the future. Those in the US will have to wait a little longer before it makes its regional debut on Netflix on 6th January 2026.</p>
<p>Here's an official synopsis of what we can expect from this third season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been one year since the events in Laqua left the Rising Volt Tacklers without a leader and a way forward, but a mysterious pink mist that harms Pokémon spurs Liko and Roy into action! Both Trainers have gained confidence and strength alongside their Pokémon, including Roy’s newest friend, a yellow Lucario capable of Mega Evolution. They’re joined by Dot, an intel-gathering expert, and Ult, a brash young Trainer who considers Roy his rival. Determined to rebuild the Rising Volt Tacklers and fulfill a promise made in Laqua, Liko, Roy, and friends are training harder than ever as they take on the Explorers and forge a new path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all of that means nothing to you, then you can catch up on seasons one and two on iPlayer right now to work out what's going down with Liko, Roy and the gang.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> arrives before all that, with both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions launching next week on 16th October.</p>
