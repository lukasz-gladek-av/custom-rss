<p>Bang for your buck</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Those who have played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a> know just how big of a game it really is. <a href="https://hundred-line.com/news/?id=69524">According to the publisher</a>, however, the release was actually two games in one, and that's supposedly how it's going to be marketed from now on.</p>
<p>Confused? Yeah don't worry, it's understandable. Effectively, once you complete 100 in-game days, you roll the credits and then commence 'New Game +' (although the title menu does, in fact, display 'The Hundred Line 2'), during which you make key decisions to splinter the narrative into dozens of potential branches.</p>
<p>So, the first 100 days is 'The Hundred Line', while the following narrative is 'The Hundred Line 2'. So there you go: it's now officially two games in one! So the title that launched last year is now being described as a 'value 1 &amp; 2 pack'.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, a new trailer has been released (above) to highlight the events that take place in the 'sequel', while a brand new piece of key art has been shared to demonstrate the two distinct narratives. Pardon the poor quality, it's the best we could find from an official source.</p>

<p>In addition, it's been confirmed that an official soundtrack is launching on all major streaming services on <strong>17th January 2026</strong>. A physical soundtrack will also be made available in April to mark the game's first anniversary. In Japan, meanwhile, a <a href="https://online.aniplex.co.jp/itemoazLMQxE.html">new special edition release</a> of the game will be made available from April, featuring brand new artwork to acknowledge the 'sequel'.</p>

<p>A climactic battle awaits</p>

<figure data-uuid="cf9fa91b7c2eb"><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf9fa91b7c2eb/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, LEGO</em></figcaption></figure><p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-new-zelda-lego-set-rumour-links-it-to-fan-favourite-entry">after some rumours</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-teases-a-new-lego-legend-of-zelda-set-possibly-including-ganon">teased a new <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong>-themed Lego set</a> coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Now that we're in the new year, it seems this set might have actually leaked ahead of the official reveal. As the rumours suggested, it appears to be a diorama based on the "final battle" between Link, Zelda and Ganondorf in the N64 hit, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>According to this latest scoop (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/">via r/Legoleak</a>), it's officially titled '77093 The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time' and will contain 1003 pieces and the three Minifigs. Additionally, Zelda fans will also apparently get Navi the fairy, a "brick-built" version of Ganon, the Megaton Hammer and some recovery hearts.</p>
<p>This set is supposedly priced at $129.99 and is said to be launching on 1st March 2026. Here's the first proper look:</p>

<p>This build would follow the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-2-in-1-a-superb-debut-with-one-minor-irritation">Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set</a> which arrived in 2024 for $299.99 and contained 2500 pieces. This year also happens to mark the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> series, so plenty of announcements are expected.</p>
<p>This follows the official reveal of three <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> Lego sets earlier this week. These are scheduled to launch on Pokémon Day.</p>

<p>Including updates to resolution and load times</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on the Switch 2 this week, and some video comparisons have now popped up online.</p>
<p>One of these has been shared by the <a href="https://youtu.be/MUO1BRWZ8wQ?t=24">YouTube channel 'ElAnalistaDeBits'</a>, which not only presents a side-by-side visual comparison of the Switch 2 Edition next to the existing Switch release, but also shows other improvements such as the game's loading times.</p>
<p>As Nintendo has previously noted, the Switch 2 Edition is "4K" in docked mode. As for handheld, it's 1080p (so everything looks nice and "sharp"), and both versions of the game run at a consistent 30fps. There's also a demonstration of the improved load times. Similar to the resolution bump, you may or may not notice the difference when you're playing the game.</p>
<p>In this particular video demo, you can see in one example, on Switch 2, how it takes eight seconds to get from the title screen to the game, while the Switch version takes around 17 seconds. In another test, loading from the system home menu to actual gameplay takes 16 seconds on the Switch 2 and about 30 seconds on the original system.</p>
<p>We've also shared our thoughts about the Switch 2 version's resolution, frame rate and load times, so if you haven't already read our review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">be sure to check it out</a>. Nintendo previously highlighted the Switch 2 Edition's "enhanced resolution" in the original announcement trailer. You can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update#animal-crossing-new-horizons-all-switch-2-features">see this side-by-side comparison</a> in our full guide.</p>
