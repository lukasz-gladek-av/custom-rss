            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When I originally reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_x_shadow_generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> on the Switch, I went bold and called it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-x-shadow-generations">“the very best 3D Sonic game so far”</a> – a statement I very much stand by. The combination of the nostalgia-fueled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_generations">Sonic Generations</a> and the thrillingly dark, Shadow-focused expansion made it an experience that comfortably outranks even my beloved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a>. This remains the case on Switch 2.</p>
<p>So what’s changed with the new release? Well, hardly anything, to be honest. In terms of content, this is the exact same game you might have played back in 2024. That’s still quite a bit, mind you, with both Sonic and Shadow campaigns taking around five or six hours or so to reach the credits; more if you go for full completion. But still, if you’re hoping for a sprinkling of bonus content to justify the move to Nintendo’s new console, you won’t find it here.</p>
<p>What <em>has</em> changed is the performance and resolution. On the Switch 1, Sonic Generations managed to reach 1080p when docked, while Shadow Generations capped out at 720p. Both, however, are locked at 30fps. On the Switch 2, Sonic Generations defaults to 60fps while boasting much crisper visuals, bringing it more in line with the release on PS5 and Xbox.</p>
<p>Shadow Generations, on the other hand, offers up two choices. Quality mode keeps the 30fps gameplay from Switch 1 and bumps up resolution, while performance mode doubles the frame rate. When docked, the visuals in performance mode still look pretty nice, resulting in a good balance between attractive graphics and smooth gameplay. In handheld mode, however, the characters and world definitely look a little muddy.</p>
<p>I’m not usually one to opt for prettier visuals over higher frame rates, but coming from the Switch 1 version took the sting out of the 30fps performance somewhat, and the bump in visuals felt like a nice upgrade in comparison. Performance mode feels perfectly fine for docked play, but I’ve no qualms switching over to quality mode for when I’m out and about.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with all of this is that Sega has opted to completely shaft those who bought the game on Switch 1, with no upgrade path to the Switch 2 version at all. Given the minimal enhancements, it feels like a proper kick in the teeth for fans - I can’t imagine many current owners are keen on parting with £45 / $50 for performance enhancements. Look to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> for an idea of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-gets-switch-2-release-date-with-paid-upgrade-path-for-switch-1-players">how this should be done</a>.</p>
<p>So, whether you take a punt on Sonic X Shadow Generations for the Switch 2 will very much depend on whether you already own it or not. If you don’t, add two points to the score below and jump in: it’s a great game and this is undoubtedly the best way to play it on Nintendo systems. If you do, however, you should think twice about double-dipping. It’s already a splendid game on Switch 1, and with no upgrade path or new content, you're missing out on very little if you skip it.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be"</p>

<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103">posted on X</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that the movie was being delayed "for production reasons". The film's original release date was 26th March 2027, so it's only a few extra weeks.</p>
<p>"It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be."</p>

<p>The movie was originally announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/surprise-nintendo-is-officially-working-on-a-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie">back in November 2023</a>, with a release date revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-coming-march-2027">in March 2025</a> via the Nintendo Today! app.</p>
<p>The movie is being directed by Wes Ball, the man behind the camera on The Maze Runner and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.

<figure><a title="Review: Genki Sleeper Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/360ca88f5e6f7/review-genki-sleeper-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When you've got a shiny new handheld like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>, getting a good carry case is of the utmost importance. However, not all carry cases are created equal; some are fine when it comes to providing a modicum of protection on the move, while others are built with a little more robustness. I'm pleased to report that <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki's Sleeper Case</a> ($42.99 / £36) is definitely in the latter camp and perhaps represents one of the best Switch 2 cases on the market right now.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me when I removed the Sleeper Case from its packaging was just how sturdy it felt. According to Genki, the case is constructed with "materials trusted in motorsport gear", and it certainly feels that way.</p>
<p>The case has surprisingly little flex when completely closed and is apparently "crush-proof", according to the manufacturer. Genki says it's "virtually indestructible" and that it has even taken hammers to the case to test its strength, although it advises against customers trying the same thing. I wasn't going to try, to be honest, but I can certainly believe the Sleeper Case is capable of withstanding some severe punishment.</p>

<p>What makes this case remarkable is that, despite its robust nature, the external wool coating feels pretty welcoming. This material is apparently specially treated to resist water, stains, and abrasions. It looks great, in my opinion, and certainly stands out from your typical Switch 2 case. On the back, there's an elasticated strip that you can fit your fingers through, giving you additional grip when you're carrying the case around.</p>
<p>The ability to resist water extends to the "incognito" zipper, which, when fully closed, is almost impossible to see. There's a tradeoff here, however; the zipper system is quite tight and often difficult to close. This way well ease up over time, but it takes a fair bit of effort to engage it fully.</p>
<p>Inside the case, your Switch 2 console is presented with a reasonably snug fit. It's not as tight as some other cases, and there's a little room for movement because the case is designed to accept your Switch 2 with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector modular case</a> installed (however, you can only use the smallest 'feather' grips with this case; the other two grips are too wide to fit).</p>

<p>The screen is protected by a flap which doubles as a holder for a whopping 18 Game Cards (Nintendo's official case can only hold six). It's brilliant to have that amount of game storage built into the case as it means I don't have to take additional Game Card holders on the road with me. But it also makes me somewhat worried about misplacing or losing the Sleeper Case when I'm out and about, as that's a <em>lot</em> of monetary value at risk.</p>
<p>All things considered, though, the Genki Sleeper Case is one of the best options on the market when it comes to Switch 2 storage and transport. It's smart, rugged and has plenty of space for games inside, making it a fantastic alternative to Nintendo's official offering.</p>
