<p>It was the NSO newbie <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a> that got put under the microscope <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-fatal-fury-special-snes">last time</a>, as we matched up two covers for this SNES brawler. Overall, it was a pretty one-sided fight. The colourful Japanese variant walked away with 68% of the vote, leaving the North American design with 32%.</p>
<p>This week, with Pokémon fever in the air, we're taking a look at the series' oft-forgotten spin-off, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hey_you_pikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a>. You remember this one, right? It's the N64 game with the microphone where you develop a close bond with Pikachu by repeatedly shouting rudimentary commands into the little yellow plastic sphere. Okay, it rarely worked, and it's hardly a classic, but it's got some regional variety in its box art.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsklnwi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The game was never released in Europe, so we just have two covers to choose between this week. Let's check 'em out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:163800 @ 1760872340 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0b0c9064383d9"><a title="Hey You, Pikachu! - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b0c9064383d9/hey-you-pikachu-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/243-hey-you-pikachu">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American cover is pretty unremarkable. Pikachu takes centre stage, naturally, with a coastal setting stretching out in the background. So why, oh why, can't we take our eyes off of Pika's weirdly detailed little fingers? Are those... knuckles? Don't tell us they're fingernails... Oh god, we can't look away.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6b17408be9abb"><a title="Hey You, Pikachu! - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b17408be9abb/hey-you-pikachu-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/243-hey-you-pikachu">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those horrific, tiny fingers make a return in the Japanese box art, but they're here posed into a cute little 'peace' sign, so we're slightly less distracted by them. The coastal background is replaced by rolling hills, and the vertical formatting means we can see more of Pikachu's frame. Hey, we're just grateful this didn't produce hyper-realistic toes.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-hey-you-pikachu]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sega celebrated the 'Year of Shadow' in 2024</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="75bcb26d6fd1f"><a title="Shadow the Hedgehog" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75bcb26d6fd1f/shadow-the-hedgehog.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Sega ran a year-long campaign for Shadow the Hedgehog that lined up with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> and the introduction of the "Ultimate Lifeform" in the live-action Sonic movies.</p>
<p>This was generally well-received by Sonic fans, and it's now led to some discussion about how Sega could potentially recreate this magic with <em>other</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> characters in the future. Speaking in a <a href="https://youtu.be/IGVWVq8cJPI">recent interview</a>, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka said he would like to continue this trend by spotlighting a different character. Characters in the next movie will apparently play an active role in this.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zyvswn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Takashi Iizuka:</strong> “Last year, we promoted The Year of Shadow, influenced by the movie, but I’d like to choose a theme each year and spotlight different characters. I think we can predict which characters will appear in the upcoming movie, so I’d like those characters to play an active role.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As any Sonic fan would know, Sega has a huge cast of characters it can call on. The most recent game release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> features characters from multiple generations of Sonic. Apart from the main cast, this includes characters like Espio, Zavok, and even Sonic's Werehog form.</p>
<p>In terms of the live-action movies, the post-credit scenes in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 have already put the spotlight on a few classic characters, seemingly setting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/seemingly%20setting%20up%20the%20fourth%20major">the fourth major outing</a>.</p>

<p>Anything is possible after Virtual Boy's revival</p>

Now, a new Nintendo patent filed in April and published this week has ignited rumours about Nintendo DS games potentially returning in the future.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613">Mike Odyssey on social media (via GoNintendo)</a>, the three methods of dual-screen gaming detailed include "Dual Screen (Parent and Child Screens), Single Screen Mode (Picture in Picture) and Switch Mode (Switch between Screens)". You can <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3ZAZvTXYAACnrb?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096">read the abstract and see each image</a> in the post:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zyvswn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The Nintendo DS library previously appeared on Wii U's Virtual Console service. It featured over 30 games and supported touch interaction on the system's GamePad. Considering this particular collection has already appeared on a Nintendo online service, it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if it did resurface at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a patent, so it doesn't necessarily guarantee anything is in the pipeline for the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library, and it could just be Nintendo going about its usual business. If we do hear anything else about this latest discovery, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon’s Tilt</a> deservedly received praise for its occult-themed gameplay, with many deeming it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">worthy spiritual successor</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/tg16/devils_crush">Devil’s Crush</a>. Now, sole developer WIZNWAR is back with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a>, a cyberpunk-inspired twist that improves upon its predecessor in almost every conceivable way. Simply put, this is one of the greatest pinball games ever made.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a> managed to pull in players who have never even entertained the idea of playing poker, then Xenotilt has the power to do the same for pinball – it’s remarkably approachable while being <em>incredibly</em> difficult to put down once it's got a hold of you. In combining straightforward mechanics with a near-constant stream of points topping up your high score, you’ll find the desire to have “just one more go” almost impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Set on a single ‘table’ (which is themed to look like a spaceship of sorts), the aim is simple: score as many points as you can with your three allocated balls. Split between three distinct tiers, the table houses a selection of boss characters that you’ll need to vanquish to gain huge chunks of points.</p>
<p>You achieve this by battering them with your ball via carefully aimed shots from the flippers, or by firing from auto-turrets. You activate these (providing you have ammo) by ‘cradling’ the ball on one of the flippers and pressing ‘down’. The turrets immediately lock onto enemies both big and small, and it’s a great way to clear the field and give yourself some more room.</p>
<p>Like other pinball games, you can also nudge the table to coax the ball into moving in specific directions, either to hit an enemy, grab a jackpot, or prevent yourself from falling into oblivion. Nudging too often within a short period of time can lead to a game over, so use this sparingly!</p>
<p>There's <em>endless</em> opportunities to ramp up your score, and if you’re able to maintain your combo multiplier, you’ll soon find that you’re able to break through the million-point barrier, perhaps even the billion. This is perfectly doable on ‘Normal Mode’, but if you opt for ‘EX Mode’, you can occasionally enter bonus areas completely separate from the main table. These offer up massive rewards, and one is even a quaint little spin on the game of snooker – it’s great fun.</p>
<p>It also looks the part too, with pixel art sprites, neon colours, and gloriously outrageous effects combining to create a stunning symphony of light and sound. It can sometimes be difficult to keep track of things in the default view, but Xenotilt also supports TATE mode, which looks awesome whether you’re playing on the OLED Model or the Switch 2. Similarly, the music is inspired, and I guarantee that at least one of the tracks will get stuck in your head long after you step away from the table.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played a pinball game before, then Xenotilt might well be the only one you’ll ever need. Heck, even if you don't <em>like</em> pinball, I suspect playing this might very well change your mind – it's mercilessly addictive from the get-go. Give it a shot and you’ll soon succumb to its will.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action]]></content:encoded>
