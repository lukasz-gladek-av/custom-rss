<figure data-uuid="359d1c7cb03bc"><a title="Sonic CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359d1c7cb03bc/sonic-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/54299">Famitsu</a> has published the latest boxed charts for Japan, and we've got a few newcomers this week to mix up the top ten.</p>
<p>In pole position is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> for the PS5, which starts strong with 57,475 units sold. Not too far behind, however, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, adding another 35,027 to its running total. In fact, the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> couldn't keep up with Nintendo's kart racer, and lands at number 9 with 5,571 units sold.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Sonic's appeal in Japan isn't quite on par with Western audiences, and it's equally just as likely that folks are simply waiting for the Switch 2 version, which is due to launch later this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> also makes its debut, with the Switch version beating the PS5 version to sell 10,425 copies in its launch week.</p>
<p>Here's the full lowdown on the top ten for this week:</p>

<p>Happy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> release day on Switch! Whether you're buying one (or both) of the classic Wii platformers for the Switch — which also have a free patch for Switch 2 — you'll probably want a good idea of how each of them look and run, and what the differences are between their older versions.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUbpoFO6-Q">Digital Foundry</a> has the lowdown on just what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> play and run like on both consoles, and in comparison to the Wii versions (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">All-Stars</a>, in Galaxy 1's case).</p>
<p>And, really, it's a clean upgrade overall, with the big winner being the updated textures. Paired with the resolution boost on both Switch 1 (1080p) and Switch 2 (4K), all textures — from grass to walls to even the shiny stars — the games look beautiful. You can see the stitching in Mario's dungarees now!</p>
<figure data-uuid="93d4566b71770"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93d4566b71770/super-mario-galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsFCLRCvdzY">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario Galaxy 2 is obviously the highlight here, as this wasn't rereleased alongside its predecessor before now, and the jump is significant. Sharper character models and polygons mean the game looks the best it can, and we're delighted.</p>
<p>For both games, there are very few drops on the Switch 1 version, and even fewer on Switch 2, meaning these are the prettiest versions of the game to play. The only real downsides come from the lower bitrate in cutscenes, and there's colour-banding in the sky in a handful of places.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is a lovely — if pricey — treat for fans of Super Mario Galaxy. And for those of you who've never played these games before? You're in for some magic.</p>
