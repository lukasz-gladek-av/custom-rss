            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1ef35c9de0909"><a title="Operation C 35th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ef35c9de0909/operation-c-35th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in the 1980s, and more specifically 1987, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/contra">Contra</a> in its original coin-op form was a game so awe-inspiring in its action, its graphics, and its weapons (you never forget you first spreader) that everyone who was anyone — which meant I was out from the get-go-- was to be found down their local arcade pumping coins into the bleeding thing on repeat.</p>
<p>It felt amazing to play (once I finally got my turn) in its smooth side-scrolling platforming, fast action, and tough baddies, and it also smashed the general action movie vibe of the time, which was basically big dumb muscle men shooting everything that moved with impunity.</p>
<p>Yes, this was a game that laid the foundations for a whole load of arcade shooters to come down the road, and it still stands as one of the very best of the lot, even when you add in stuff like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/metal_slug">Metal Slug</a>. So we're in good company.</p>
<p>To have this sort of experience in your house was the dream, then, and it was a dream duly realised on the NES with a stonking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/contra">Contra</a> port that actually bettered the OG arcade. Man, I wish I'd had a NES back in the day. I had to wait all the way until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-play-this-one-particular-snes-game-every-xmas-as-a-personal-tradition">Street Fighter 2 on SNES for my first arcade parity moment of joy</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, we all know Contra, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_contra">Super Contra</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/contra_iii_the_alien_wars">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a> and all the rest. They're stone cold classics. But today is the turn of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/operation_c">Operation C</a>, a Game Boy sequel to Super Contra that was the very first handheld adventure in the series. And it's a cracker. Yes, it is. A cracker that's now 35 Earth-years old!</p>
<p>We gave Operation C <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/08/operation_c_retro">an 8/10 back in 2009</a> (which makes my gilding of its lily much easier, thanks), concluding that, "This is without a doubt a Contra game more worthy of its title than, say, certain PlayStation entries. It hits on most of the aspects that make a good entry: challenging gameplay, tight controls, varied enemies, killer arsenal, macho tunes, big bosses."</p>
<p>Correct! And quite besides the fact that Operation C nails everything it needs to in terms of its levels and action, besides the fact I can whip it out on my Game Boy to this very day and crack into a game that still plays and controls well (or you could just play it via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Contra Anniversary Collection</a>), the <em>really</em> dazzling aspect here is just how early in the Game Boy's life we got such a fully-fledged and impressive entry.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:5506 @ 1767897800 -->

<p>Nintendo's iconic handheld had only been around for two years and here we had it presenting players with a Contra adventure, complete with its signature side-scrolling <em>and</em> top-down levels, with the only fly in the ointment being that you couldn't have another player join you for co-op shenanigans. Hey, I would have taken that deal on more than a few Switch ports over the past few years.</p>
<p>Booting into Operation C now, three-and-a-half decades after the fact, and around 30 since I last played it, well, there's an overwhelming sense of sadness at the waste I've made of my life since I last saw its start screen - but perhaps that's another article for another time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's a game that genuinely still captivates, and with just five levels in total to blow through, it's very doable if you have a little time on your hands. Heck, it's slightly easier than other Contra games, so you might even get somewhere in this one. You never know.</p>
<figure data-videoid="muD-sG6Qbgw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muD-sG6Qbgw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><p><iframe id="ytmuD-sG6Qbgw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/muD-sG6Qbgw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muD-sG6Qbgw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><figcaption>In Europe, as with the other early games in the series, we got robots and a name-change to 'Probotector'</figcaption></figure>
<p>This smart handheld version did well in carefully rejigging aspects such as more complex background and level details to keep things running smoothly without removing any of the tricks and traps that made side-scrollers like this so exciting and novel at the time. Yes, moving elevators were <em>very</em> exciting in a video game in the 1980s - what of it?</p>
<p>Weapons fire off nice big bullets that are easy to track to their target, and even though Contra pros might notice the gameplay a tad slower (to help with the Game Boy's ghosting-prone screen), this really is a proper entry in every regard.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Operation C! Now, where did I put that piece of paper with the Konami code on it? I've heard it unlocks stage select mode.</p>

<p>Nintendo hits its first hurdle</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="e04c98416aacb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e04c98416aacb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks back, we covered news that the US suffered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-us-suffered-its-worst-november-since-1995-in-terms-of-hardware-sales">its worst November since 1995</a> in terms of console hardware sales. Well, as reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over">The Game Business</a>, the Switch 2 wasn't immune, with sales down by 35% in the US compared to what the original Switch delivered in the same period during 2017.</p>
<p>Things are <em>slightly</em> better in the UK, though not by much. When comparing the same periods, the Switch 2 was down by 16% compared to the original Switch. It does, however, seem like a lot more people bought the Switch 2 during its first few months on the market, as overall sales for 2025 were actually up by by 6% compared to the Switch (which was also released a full 14 weeks earlier too, by the way).</p>
<p>Over in France, which is typically one of the strongest regions in Europe for Nintendo, Switch 2 sales for the Christmas period were down by "over 30%" compared to the Switch. This means that the UK actually saw stronger console sales than France over the same period.</p>
<p>Sales in Japan were also down, though admittedly not by much. We actually have solid figures here, too, with the Switch 2 shifting a total of 1.32 million consoles during the last nine weeks of 2025, while the Switch managed a total of 1.39 million during the same period in 2017, resulting in a decrease of around 5.5%. Similar to the situation in the UK, overall Switch 2 sales for the year in Japan were up by 11% compared to the Switch's launch year.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is doing remarkably well, then, and has already nailed the record as the fastest-selling console of all time. But as noted by an unnamed senior Nintendo employee when speaking to The Game Business, the "complicated economic landscape” mixed with higher price points and “the absence of a major Western game” means that the Switch 2 hasn't enjoyed quite as strong a Christmas period as the company might have hoped.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how things pan out in 2026. Nintendo is currently lacking a major "must-have" title for the Switch 2, with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> headlining the line-up so far. However, if rumours of a potential <strong>Pokémon Gen 10</strong> release later this year turn out to be true, then we reckon Nintendo might have the Christmas 2026 period in the bag.</p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">Nintendo announced</a> a line of child-friendly products under the 'My Mario' banner, including a free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app for Switch and mobile, cute sets of wooden block amiibo, and assorted merch aimed at babies and toddlers.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before it all found its way out of Japan and the company has now confirmed that the line will be launching in the US from <strong>19th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Designed "to offer fun ways for young children and their parents to explore, imagine and play side-by-side," according to the official blurb, the collection will be coming to the Nintendo New York and San Francisco stores in February and appearing at "select retail stores" in the spring. There's no word on a UK or European release just yet, but we'll update this article when we get confirmation on this side of the pond.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jnvhyk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
