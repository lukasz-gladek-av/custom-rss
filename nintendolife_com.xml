<figure><a title="Shantae Advance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2938dcb2503a1/shantae-advance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: WayForward</em></figcaption></figure><p>Wayforward was able to revive a slice of history last month with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>This Switch eShop release, originally planned for the GBA, has now received an update across all platforms. It addresses a bug that caused Shantae to "freeze or disappear", corrects some language-related issues, and more. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/WayForward/status/1965158363588686159">WayForward's social media page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WayForward:</strong> "The update patch for Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is now Ret-2-Go on all platforms! This patch fixes a bug that could cause Shantae to freeze or disappear, corrects a few language-related issues, and improves custom key mapping on Steam. Thanks for your patience!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it is only a small update, it's nice to see the team has now resolved these problems. If you haven't already checked out this release on the Switch, be sure to take a look at our review. It's a solid adventure, and the Tremor Engine leads to some interesting level design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is an interesting ‘new’ entry in the beloved indie franchise, a curious fusion of old and new design philosophies. Its creative world-cycling gameplay mechanic, sharp 32-bit visuals, densely packed overworld, and charming narrative all come together to make for a worthwhile experience, even if some more outdated elements like the lack of a map hold it back."</p>
