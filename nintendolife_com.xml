            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9cd0e499927a1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cd0e499927a1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">financial data</a> for the six months ending <strong>30th September 2025</strong>, and has provided updated sales figures for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The console has now sold at least <strong>10.36 million units</strong> according to the official figures, which is seemingly more than even Nintendo itself was anticipating. As such, the company has increased its forecast for the year, bumping expected Switch 2 sales up from <strong>15 million</strong> to <strong>19 million</strong>. Switch 2 software has seen a similar jump up from <strong>45 million</strong> to <strong>48 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Naturally, this also means that sales for the original Switch family of systems have tanked, with the console pulling in a meagre <strong>1.89 million</strong> in sales, a hefty drop of 60% year-on-year. As a result, Nintendo has decreased its forecast for the Switch accordingly, lowering console sales from <strong>4.5 million</strong> to <strong>4 million</strong>. On the flip side, however, thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility, the software forecast has been increased from <strong>105 million</strong> to <strong>125 million;</strong> a bump of 19%.</p>
<p>Here's a look at how the Switch 2 has sold across various regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Americas - 3.68m</li>
<li>Europe - 2.40m</li>
<li>Japan - 2.35m</li>
<li>Other - 1.93m</li>
</ul>
<p>With the help of bundles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has also sold an extraordinary amount, shifting a total of <strong>9.57 million</strong> <strong>units</strong> since launch – a remarkable attach rate of over 92%. Meanwhile, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold <strong>3.49 million units</strong>, which perhaps isn't as high as fans would have hoped for. Still, it's a good start nevertheless.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that a total of <strong>20.62 million software units</strong> for the Switch 2 have been sold since launch, of which approximately <strong>8.10 million</strong> were bundled with the console itself.</p>
<p>A pretty solid start for the Switch 2, then! As expected, this also means that gross profit also saw a nice little bump for the company, "rising 25.3% year-on-year to 398.4 billion yen". It's also increased its financial forecasts for the year, including net sales to 2,250.0 billion yen and operating profit to 370.0 billion yen.</p>

<p>Earlier in the same week, it also added the Nintendo DS soundtrack <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> to the service. You can see what else is available on this mobile app in our guide here on Nintendo Life:</p>
