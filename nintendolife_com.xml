<p>Punching onto Nintendo platforms this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the Summer Game Fest, Marvel fans were treated to another look at the beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, along with a look at two more playable characters.</p>
<p>She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon will join multiple other characters from the Marvel universe including famous heroes like Captain America, Wolverine and Spider-Man. Here's a bit of PR and you can see the new trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, all life hangs in the balance… To face this threat, She-Hulk forgoes litigation and takes matters into her own hands; get ready to grapple and toss enemies around with her gamma-powered might! And if you’re more into firepower, blast your way through a barrage of bugs with Rocket Raccoon and his hard-hitting futuristic arsenal! With his penchant for sporadically lobbing grenades, you’re looking at MARVEL Cosmic Invasion’s most chaotic fighter yet.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon join Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Phyla-Vell, Venom, and Nova as part of an out-of-this-world roster inspired by classic MARVEL comic books!</p>
<p>Get ready to brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another game from Dotemu and Tribute Games (known for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a> and the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>).

<p>A Mario Party-style game and a co-op adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>LEGO fans are in for a treat with not one but two new titles announced today for the Switch and both are due out later this year.</p>
<p>First up we've got <strong>LEGO Voyagers</strong> - a new two-player co-op adventure all about "friendship and play". There'll even be a "Friend's Pass" a bit like Hazelight's games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>) where you can play together with just one copy of the game.</p>
<p>This title will be released by Annapurna Interactive and is once again "coming soon". Here's a bit more PR about it, and you can check out the official trailer above.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-3" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bricks who click together, stick together LEGO® Voyagers is a new 2-player co-op adventure that’s all about building spaceships, excitement and friendships. Share a screen or play online – whatever works for you. The game will also feature Friend’s Pass, allowing you to play together using just one purchased copy of the game. Grab your brick buddy and get ready for an incredible adventure!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next up is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party">Mario Party</a>-style title <strong>LEGO Party</strong>. It features "60 hilarious minigames" and plenty of board game action. There's also online cross-platform support to keep the party going.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Compete against your friends in wacky Challenge Zones and 60 hilarious minigames from across your favorite LEGO sets like Pirates, Space, NINJAGO® and more. Join your friends online no matter their platform, for a LEGO® Party game night."</p>

<p>A new adventure through "space, time, and the streets of Toronto"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some exciting news for Scott Pilgrim fans, with Tribute Games announcing it's teaming up with Universal and the series creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to release an "all-new, action-packed" video game entry on multiple platforms including the Switch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a></strong> is set to arrive in "early 2026" and will reimagine the fan-favourite universe with its modern approach to traditional brawlers. Here's some official PR about what exactly you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Players take on the role of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and more of the all-star crew to battle a variety of enemies in a warped version of Toronto overrun by demons, vegan henchmen and robots in an epic quest to save the city.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"With hard-hitting combat and explosive art, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX reinvents classic 2D brawling for a new era, blending high-energy action with fun character progression. Each of the seven playable characters features a full move set from the start, but players can customize their experience through upgradeable stats, and equippable special items making every fighter feel truly personal. Players will be able to dive into a brand-new storyline, co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games. They can also unleash creative combos, wield wild weapons, and brawl through co-op action—set to all-new music by Anamanaguchi —as <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX delivers a bold new chapter for longtime fans and newcomers alike."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the creator, who is deeply involved in this project, Anamanaguchi will also be returning to provide an explosive blend of 8-bit and "hyper-melodic rock". Pixel artist Paul Robertson is also helping out Tribute's in-house team on character animations and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off director and showrunner Ben David Grabinski is also on board as a creative consultant.</p>

<p>Four more fighters are on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the release of Elena as well as the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> this week, Capcom has now lifted the lid on the Year 3 paid DLC roster.</p>
<p>For this very special occasion, it's called on the help of pro wrestler and gaming fan Kenny Omega, who takes the spotlight in the above cinematic and gameplay trailer as each of the new fighters. So, here are the next batch of characters on the way to Street Fighter 6:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sagat - Summer 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>C. Viper - Autumn 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alex - Early Spring 2026</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ingrid - Late Spring 2026</strong><br></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to give Street Fighter 6 a go on the Switch 2, there's a free demo you can download from the eShop right now. It gives you access to the World Tour mode, along with the verse mode (including Gyro control matches).</p>
<p>Our review for Street Fighter 6 has also gone live here on Nintendo Life, if you're interested in finding out more about how the game runs on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>

<p>Still waiting on the console confirmation, though...</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2ef855a525b7f/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, this one feels like it has been a long time coming. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> dev Yacht Club Games popped up at Summer Game Fest's opening night showcase to give us another peek at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mina_the_hollower">Mina The Hollower</a>. What's more, we finally have a release date... on PC.</p>
<p>This hotly anticipated Zelda-inspired adventure will arrive on Steam on <strong>31st October</strong>, channelling all of those retro spooky vibes into the most fitting day of the year. There's even a Steam demo available <em>right now</em>, for those who want to see what the Shovel Knight studio has in store.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, we should point out that Yacht Club is still yet to confirm any console plans for Mina the Hollower, so there's no guarantee that the game will arrive on Switch/Switch 2 on Halloween, if at all. That said, the Shovel Knight popularity on Switch (he has an amiibo, for crying out loud) and Zelda vibes have us pretty confident that this will be coming our way before long. At least, we really, <em>really</em> hope it does, because it looks awesome.</p>
<p>For those who are new to this one, Mina the Hollower was announced back in early 2022, with a Kickstarter campaign that reached its goal in no time at all. It's packed with retro Zelda vibes, from its approach to puzzles to its GBC-esque pixel art, <em>and</em> you play as an adorable little mouse. What's not to like?</p>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for some kind of Switch 2 confirmation over the coming months. Let's hope we don't have to wait too much longer, eh?</p>
