<figure data-uuid="5578c9cb15efa"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5578c9cb15efa/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Friday 5th December marks the six-month mark for Nintendo's sequel system. Launching back in June, the earliest adopters among us have now been living with the console for half a year. Blimey! It seems like only yesterday we were all speculating about the follow-up to Switch 1. Would it launch in 2022? 2023? 2024?...</p>
<p>Yes, Switch 2 has been in our minds for years, and it feels surreal to have possessed the thing for six months now. So, before we get into the annual GOTY madness, now's a good time to look back, take stock, and briefly discuss how we're getting on with Switch Part Deux.</p>
<p>You'll find some polls below related to the hardware itself, the software lineup, and how you'd rate the whole shebang now that the final marquee first-party game of the year is out in the wild. (It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid</a>, if you somehow hadn't noticed all the articles with Samus in the lead image.)</p>
<p>Let's start with the system itself, now that the new hardware smell has worn off...</p>
<h2>Hardware: It's a Switch, too</h2>

<p>Picking up my launch-day console, I'm happy to say my initial impressions — as chronicled in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">my hardware review</a> back in mid-June — still hold true.</p>
<p>Having gone back to Switch 1 for review purposes a few times in the last few months, the older console feels so very, very slow. My heart still goes out to the OLED's screen, but besides the novelty of it being slightly smaller, there's nothing about the first console I miss.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182525 @ 1764939328 -->
<p>Switch 2 came in very hot with a launch day update essentially 'activating' it, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">various system updates</a> have refined things on the firmware side. My Joy-Con are still functioning perfectly - which should really be a given, but the spectre of drift lingers, as does the pile of useless OG Joy-Con in the cupboard.</p>
<p>I'm fairly careful with all my devices, but I've taken the system on trips, packed it in suitcases, and generally given it a full and thorough 'using' across all modes, and it's coped with those day-to-day rigours just fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock">User reports</a> about a faulty or malfunctioning LAN port in the dock are disappointing, although it's not a problem anyone on Team NL has run into. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">legitimate complaints</a> around blurry panel problems and ghosting seem to have died down, too - not that those issues don't still exist, they just don't seem to be troubling the vast majority of Switch 2 owners.</p>
<p>On the whole, then, there are areas to polish (and the screen on my trusty OLED model still looks spectacular) but Switch 2 gets things mostly right, and it's holding up well after six months of use, if not abuse. What about yours?</p>

<h2>Software: Delightful, certainly, but lacking surprise?</h2>

<p>The number of truly new Switch 2 games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-games">exclusive</a> or otherwise, might be lacking, but it's hard to argue with the breadth of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">quality games</a> we've seen released since June. Plenty of familiar ports, yes — another way in which Switch 1's legacy passes directly to its successor — but with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">25 games in the launch lineup</a>, is there anything to grouse about on the consumer side, <em>really</em>?</p>
<p>Perhaps. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is a great game, but also 'just' the new Mario Kart, not a genre-defining all-timer like a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> or even a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>. Despite the brilliance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, there's nothing just yet that you <em>absolutely have to get a Switch 2</em> to play. Plenty of gems, some exquisite ports, and having them on a handheld hybrid is as convenient as ever, but the vast majority can be played elsewhere. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, for example, both perform wonderfully on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Backwards compatibility has been expanded (with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> fixes coming in a recent update), and NSO additions have kept trickling in. We're still waiting on four of the ten announced GameCube additions to show up, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">what's there is good stuff</a>.</p>
<p>So, plenty to play, but how are you feeling?</p>

<h2>How would you rate Switch 2 overall (so far)?</h2>

<p>We've briefly looked at the system and the software, but how are you feeling about your investment in the console? Any regrets? And standout moments in your time with it so far?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">The future's looking bright</a>, but let's get a numerical sit-rep - and feel free to head into the comments if you'd like to elucidate or espouse further.</p>

<p>"AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="95589e4db57d8"><a title="Sega Will &quot;Carefully Assess Appropriate Use Cases&quot; When It Comes To AI 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95589e4db57d8/sega-will-carefully-assess-appropriate-use-cases-when-it-comes-to-ai-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/IDWPublishing">Sega / IDW</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>While rivals such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ubisoft-is-all-in-on-generative-ai-says-its-as-big-a-leap-in-tech-as-the-shift-to-3d">Ubisoft</a> have jumped into the world of Generative AI development with both feet, not every company in the games industry is willing to throw caution to the wind.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session following its recent Q2 financial results, Sega‘s top brass addressed the use of AI when it comes to making games (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-says-it-will-use-ai-in-game-development-but-only-in-appropriate-use-cases/">VGC</a>) and how it will help tackle the increasing costs of development.</p>
<p>Sega's response was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI. However, as AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas such as character creation, we will proceed by carefully assess appropriate use cases, such as streamlining development processes."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while Sega certainly isn't against turning to AI to streamline production, it doesn't look like it will be embracing it with quite the same vigour as other companies.</p>
<p>While Generative AI models are powerful tools, they are often trained on the work of artists, musicians, filmmakers<span>, and animators without permission or remuneration. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">Many models have been found to produce</a></span> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">copyright-infringing results with minimal effort.</a></p>
<p>Nintendo has previously stated that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">doesn't currently intend</a> to use Generative AI in its own games, citing "issues with intellectual property rights" as one of the main reasons for avoiding it.</p>

<figure data-uuid="7c30e4405c23d"><a title="samus Aran Varia Suit Chogokin" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c30e4405c23d/samus-aran-varia-suit-chogokin.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Spirits</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally in the wild (still feels weird to be able to type that) and given that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another excellent entry</a> in this phenomenal series, you may well be feeling like now's the time for some fancy Metroid merch.</p>
<p>Well, say no more because (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/12/03/samus-aran-finally-gets-the-chogokin-toy-she-deserves-next-year/">Forbes</a> for the heads-up) Bandai Spirits has announced a very appealing diecast 'Samus Aran in Varia Suit' model that's got us morphing in and out of ball mode furiously over here. Whatever that means.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, it is very nice. We agree. Standing at 21cm, there's a whole lot of lovely diecast metal here, and with lights accentuating all of the most important and iconic elements, such as Samus' great big cannon (so batteries required). We've also got lots of nice moveable joints, so you can recreate all your most frequent in-game poses (for this writer that's just Samus' death pose).</p>


<p>We've been over <a href="https://tamashiiweb.com/item/15649/?wovn=en">on the official website</a>, and the price is set at 30,800 yen (that's around £148 or $198) and you can also pre-order on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_A3AA2">official Nintendo site</a>. However! Fly in the ointment klaxon. The pre-orders, which went live yesterday AM, are Japan-only for now. Although we can't see it being very long before you're able to get yourself one imported from either the main Bandai Spirits website or another vendor.</p>
<p>The expected release date for the model is May 2026. Ooooft. It would have looked so good on top of the Christmas tree, too. Maybe next year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cejrwhgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
