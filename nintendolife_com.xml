<figure data-uuid="cedc5f3abce7c"><a title="Nintendo Life Mailbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cedc5f3abce7c/nintendo-life-mailbox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back, lovely people, to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>! We're still in the first weeks of a new year, and we can all now officially confirm that it's...another year. Hmm.</p>
<p>Enough <em>dwelling</em> - there's more than enough of that to do when you click elsewhere on the web. Let's talk video games, shall we? Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month, we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>So, let's see what you've got to say...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - January 2026</h2>
<h3>"[redacted] for his birfday" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I still don't have a Switch 2. I totally want one, but they're SO expensive (living in Japan but playing games from all over the world I'll have to buy the extra expensive "international" version, not to mention a new gigantic SD card since I'm 100% digital, a new Pro controller, etc.). And according to my spreadsheet, I've completed 85 out of 148 or so games on my Switch. I'd love to play fancy new games (or upgrades to older games) on Switch 2, but I'm not exactly in a hurry. In fact, when it was originally released I decided that I'd wait until fancy new colors or an even fancier limited edition of some sort got released.</p>
<p>Well, fancy new colors got released this week, and I absolutely love them. But... it's not a set, and buying a Switch 2 plus extra Joy Cons goes back to my initial complaint.</p>
<p>So like, how much longer do you think I should wait?? My son is demanding that I buy him [redacted] for his birfday, but out of spite I refuse to put that thing on my Switch, so I'd rather buy a Switch 2 and let him have my original to do with as he pleases. Yes, I know, I'm a terrible father. His birfday is approaching very rapidly, though, so I kind of want to use him as an excuse to just take the expensive plunge, but if I DO buy a Switch 2 and a day later Nintendo announces a limited edition Xenoblade 4 Switch 2 I'll never forgive him because obviously it will be his fault. To summarize concisely: Me want buy fancy non-standard Switch 2 but when is happen you think does???<strong><br>
Kurt Asbestos</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, excuses-wise, it definitely won't be getting cheaper anytime soon - and there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">a good chance the price will go up</a>. Given the global challenges around production and distribution on top of the general economic strife, Nintendo won't be in a rush to put out the inevitable upgraded version, either.</p>
<p>Personally? I don't see them doing some crazy variant for a while. They might put a Triforce on it or something, but I can't imagine them doing a white one (for example) until they've got at least another holiday season ticked off. It would just anger recent adopters still stinging from the hole in their wallet.</p>
<p>Seriously, what monster contemplates putting a Light Purple Joy-Con into a non-matching Light Blue mag slot anyway? <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"2026 has started"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>2026 has started (by the time of the next reader letters issue) and I have 3 Nintendo predictions for the year:</p>
<p>1. Tomodatchi Life Living the Dream gets a direct.<br>
2. The 40th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda isn't too big of a deal with Zelda news being saved for later in the year for the lead up to the Zelda movie.<br>
3. Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow (and maybe Gold, Silver and Crystal) finally get a Switch release that is much more confusing and annoying than just adding it to Game Boy Nintendo Classics or selling them (be it an NSO price hike around the same time, a 3rd tier of NSO or some other new annoyance).<br>
<strong><em>Aidan</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> will also be available on Nintendo Switch, and the <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> special DLC pack — <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2! - Dazzling Crystal</em> — will be available for both platforms later in the year. Pre-orders will open after this broadcast and come with a limited-time bonus: the original <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em> for Nintendo Game Boy, available exclusively with this DLC set until February 27th, 2027. Please look forward to future announcements." <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"'more serious' platforms"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Where are all the new colour variations for the Joy-Con 2?! You know times are strange when 'more serious' platforms like the PlayStation and Xbox are churning out different controllers on a quarterly basis, whilst Nintendo leave us in the dark with the boring grey duo... Same for the Pro Controller 2! I'd personally love to see some colours pay homage to the NGC; Indigo, Platinum, and Orange, with coloured buttons to boot!<br>
<strong><em>Moochy</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There they are, Moochy! No sooner had you sent this than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">Nintendo announced a new boring grey duo</a> with pastel accents.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind seeing some more interesting colours, but I'd be happy if we could just get through the generation without drift.</p>
<p>Oh, and 'Orange' is so vulgar; it's <em>Spice</em>, darling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"whip out something ridiculous"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there NL gang,</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think that with every Switch 2 Edition Nintendo conjures, there is a unwritten rule that each title must be longer than the other!</p>
<p>*Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV*<br>
*Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World*<br>
And god forbid... *Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabell Park.*<br>
I mean, seriously though, where *do* you draw the line when it comes to something like this? Does Nintendo even care if we need to take a breath midway through announcing them?!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now, those three games above _are_ fairly lengthy titles in their own right.<br>
So I think we're safe... and of course now that I've said that, they'll whip out something ridiculous like *Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition = Lubba's Fury* ...There's just no escaping it!<strong><br>
Nintoz</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has become an office joke around these parts. They start to look like equations if you stare at them long enough. 'Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Bowser Jr.'s Big Bash', anyone? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="cc158784eeed4"><a title="Link's Awakening amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc158784eeed4/links-awakening-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"great plastic"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Nintendolife!</p>
<p>I’m a big Zelda fan and I love collecting items from the series. Unfortunately, Nintendo hasn’t released new amiibo for quite some time, despite there being so many interesting characters that could be made into these great plastic figurines.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I’d like to leave you an idea for a poll on the site...<br>
<strong>Franc001</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, let's do it. (The Mineru's Contruct amiibo is still to come, remember.)</p>

<p>Not a bad selection! A comically enormous Deku Tree amiibo would make me grin, but I'd like a Sprout, too. And a Mido. And a Deku Scrub. An... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>It's really cheesy, and not the good kind of cheese." - <strong>L27</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All kinds of cheeses are good, my friend. Except that Wensleydale with the fruit in it. Horrific idea. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>it's probably a steaming pile of dung." - <strong>WoomyNNYes</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, if it looks like dung, and smells like dung, and tastes like...</p>
<p>Oof, probably should have stopped after the first two, in hindsight. Anyone got a Tic Tac? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>Has research been conducted on this?" - <strong>Davis</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm surrounded by people in lab coats brandishing clipboards as we speak. Several of them are wearing glasses. Spared no expense. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

<p>We went tactical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift-ds">last week</a>, as we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> on the DS, and it's got to be said, the results were the most one-sided we've seen in a long time. The bright European / Japanese version took home a staggering 90% of the vote, leaving the bland North American variant with a measly 10%. <em>Oof</em>.</p>
<p>With a new Yoshi game on the horizon, we're throwing it back to one of the delightful dino's most beloved entries (in the handheld space, at least), as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>. Those with a good memory might remember us tackling the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/poll_box_art_brawl_duel_55_-_super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">SNES original</a> way back in 2020, but the GBA version comes with a pair of covers all of its own, so let's take a look at them.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fwspumt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0d7b39a2a9d7d"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d7b39a2a9d7d/sma-yoshis-island-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European and North American cover will be instantly familiar to those who remember the SNES layout. It sees Yoshi and Baby Mario merrily making their way across the island as a giant Nep-Enut emerges from the water behind them. It's clean, it's colourful, it's iconic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="3d1c930803cc2"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d1c930803cc2/sma-yoshis-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flipside, the Japanese design opts for something far less level-based. Baby Mario and Yoshi still take centre stage, but they are instead surrounded by a bunch of other Yoshis, all decked out in different pastel colours to stress the multiplayer potential. The pink background might not tell you quite as much about a typical level structure as the NA/EU cover, but it is really rather cute.</p>

It's the official announcement of the new game project "<strong>AGE 1000</strong>". This title, which will get an official name at a later date, has been in development for "about 6 to 7 years now including the initial concept phase". It features a new "never-before-seen world and characters" from legend and series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/akira-toriyama-the-dragon-ball-dragon-quest-and-chrono-trigger-artist-that-inspired-the-world">creator Akira Toriyama</a>, who passed away in 2024.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Toriyama-sensei has been heavily involved in this AGE1000 project, in its world-building, characters, and many other aspects."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AGE 1000 is currently "set for 2027", although no platforms have been revealed at this point in time. As for the details about this story, the team was willing to say much at this stage, but 'AGE' refers to the year in the Dragon Ball world. There's already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1qm6ekl/comment/o1jvyhv/">plenty of speculation</a> about the game as well.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball fans can expect more information about this game at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which kicks off in April.</p>

<p>In some other Dragon Ball video game news, Bandai Namco and Spike Chunsoft have announced new "major" DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a>. More details about the Switch and Switch 2 release will be revealed in the future. For now, here's a brief description and trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Super Saiyan Bardock, Super Android 17 (GT), Great Demon King Piccolo, and more will be joining the lineup of playable characters! Plus, customizations for skills and outfits, new stages, and a new single player mode are planned to be added!</p>
<p>This fabulous DLC is scheduled for release on PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and STEAM® in summer 2026, with more details on the Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2 release to come!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahead of this new DLC, there'll also be some free updates. This includes 'Mission 100' mode ("where you use your favourite characters to challenge and clear various missions") and 'Survival Mode'. The 'Mission 100' mode will arrive on 26th January 2026 on other platforms, and 'Survival Mode' is currently scheduled for Spring.</p>

<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mysims_cozy_bundle">MySims Cozy Bundle</a>, there's reportedly been a new EA survey sent out to select Sims players, and it's believed to be hinting at a new MySims game for the Switch and other platforms.</p>
<p>It apparently suggests the game would be a "cozy, collaborative adventure simulation" title where players can "explore a whimsical world, customize their village, befriend residents &amp; pets, and uncover delightful secrets".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mzxjos&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>This title would supposedly offer solo play and multiplayer with "up to four friends". Many <a href="https://simscommunity.info/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/new-mysims-game-features.jpg">other features are listed</a>, too. This latest development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-removed-ea-app-listings-suggest-more-mysims-revivals-might-be-on-the-horizon">discovery of some MySims game listings</a> in January last year.</p>
<p>Following the release of MySims on the Switch, EA's CEO Andrew Wilson mentioned how the Cozy Bundle had performed "well ahead" of the third-party giant's expectations.</p>
<p>In our review, we gave the Switch bundle seven out of ten stars and said the titles were still engaging and easygoing spin-offs.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> series is currently celebrating 30 years, and it seems an announcement could be taking place soon.</p>
<p>A new rating has appeared on the Australian Classification Board for <strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong>. The classification took place on 22nd January 2026. Additional details list Atari as the developer and publisher, and UI Entertainment as the applicant.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee436245b45a"><a title="Rayman - Game Boy Color Box Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee436245b45a/rayman-game-boy-color-box-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ubisoft kicked off Rayman's 30th anniversary celebrations last September and it followed with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">rumours about a Rayman Remake</a>.</p>
<p>The original 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> platformer launched in 1995. On Nintendo platforms, this eventually followed with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/eshop/rayman_gbc">Game Boy Color version</a>, a Game Boy Advance port, and years later <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/dsiware/rayman">Rayman</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/12/rayman_dsiware">for DSiWare</a>. In December last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> was added to the Switch Online's Nintendo 64 library.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6wzohpi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>This rating follows news of Ubisoft's major organisational restructure. Rayman has been confirmed as being part of the company's future plans. Its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">creative house 'CH4'</a> will be responsible for the IP and other "narrative adventure" series such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time">Prince of Persia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/beyond_good_and_evil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</p>
