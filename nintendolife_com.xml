<p>If you can believe it, it has been almost a year since the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sid_meiers_civilization_vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a>. To mark the occasion, Firaxis Games Creative Director Ed Beach has shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYry-kvC8u4">special anniversary message</a>, outlining what's next for the game and teeing up today's brand-new update.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.3.2 patch is rolling out today, adding a new peppering of 'nestled tooltips' to help get your head around complex in-game terms on the fly, a lens to make locating high-Happiness tiles a bit easier, and a handful of balancing tweaks for the French Empire and Dai Viet. It also reintroduces fan-favourite ally Gilgamesh back into the leader roster, complete with a free anniversary profile badge, banner, and title.</p>
<p>Beach also shared some details on the upcoming massive 'Test of Time' update, which the team plans to launch this Spring. This update — described as "similar in scope to an expansion in terms of gameplay systems and functionality" — will introduce the option to play as one civ through all ages, reworks how Victories are achieved, and introduces a new 'Triumph' system to replace Legacy Paths. We're sure we'll hear more about this one in the coming months, but you can read a detailed rundown of everything we know so far about the Test of Time update on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/anniversary/">Civ VII website</a>.</p>
<p>But anyway, back to <em>today's</em> update. The full patch notes were shared in a recent <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">Civ VII blog post</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below. Be warned, it's quite a long one!</p>
<h2>Sid Meier's Civilization VII Ver. 1.3.2 (3rd Feb 2026)</h2>
<h3><strong>Gilgamesh Returns</strong></h3>
<p>Your best friend and King of Uruk, Gilgamesh, makes his comeback to <em>Civilization</em>! This leader is free for all <em>Civ VII</em> players with the 1.3.2 Update as a thank you for all the support we’ve seen from players over the last year, along with a free anniversary profile badge, banner, and title.</p>
<p>Whether he was your favorite ally in <em>Civ VI</em> or if you've never met the legendary demigod of Uruk face-to-face, Gilgamesh is best known for his prowess in battle. In <em>Civ VII</em>, his emphasis on Endeavors helps him maximize their value with Allies. If you're playing as Gilgamesh, make sure you form those alliances quickly, and if you're not, becoming his Ally first may benefit you greatly.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh is most effective when he invests in befriending one primary Ally. Not only does entering a war while having exactly one Ally garner him additional War Support, but his Mementos reward this one-Ally approach as well. Check out his kit below!</p>
<dl><dt>Attributes</dt><dd>Diplomatic, Militaristic</dd><dt>Unique Ability - Once Mortal, Twice Divine</dt><dd>Gain War Support when you have exactly one Ally. When you defeat an enemy Unit, gain Influence equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength. All basic Endeavors are unlocked; Endeavors with Allies don’t count against the limit of having one Endeavor of a given type active at a time. Allies can support your Endeavors for free.</dd><dt>Agenda - Ally of Enkidu</dt><dd>Increase Relationship by a Medium Amount with leaders who have started or supported the most Endeavors. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with leaders in Alliances with others.</dd></dl>
<h3><strong>Nested Tooltips</strong></h3>
<p>With Update 1.3.2, we’re adding the first pass of a new feature we’re very excited about: nested tooltips. Nested tooltips are an upgrade to our current tooltips, allowing them to turn game terms into links that provide further information when inspected.</p>
<p><em>Civ VII</em> is a deep game with lots of concepts that are new to the series, like Warehouse bonuses, and concepts that have been around a long time which we often take for granted, like Wonders. With this update, we’re upgrading our tooltips so that concepts like Warehouses or Wonders can be inspected to get a new tooltip with a brief explanation of that concept. There’s still more detailed information to be found in the Civilopedia, but these brief explainers are easier to access in the moment when you need a quick introduction or refresher on what exactly something does. Being able to nest information helps us make our tooltips more concise, and we’ve taken advantage of this opportunity to graphically refresh the affected tooltips. These two changes together should make the tooltips more readable, and thus the game more understandable. We know that the game is more fun when it helps you understand things better, as we saw with the Production List changes in 1.2.5, and we’re committed to continue improving the UI to better support that.</p>
<p>This feature is something we’re still actively working on, but we want to get the first iteration of it into your hands right away so you can let us know how it feels. Unsurprisingly, <em>Civ</em> games have a lot of text, so we’re doing this in phases. For 1.3.2, we’ve focused on populating the Tech and Civic choosers as well as the Production List tooltips first, because those are places where having more information as you make those big decisions is the most helpful.</p>
<p>We’re aiming to strike the right balance between providing useful information while not inundating the player to the point where it detracts from understanding. Do you think we struck the right balance? Let us know! Also, please let us know which areas of the game you’d find it most useful for us to focus on next. For example, we’re experimenting with automatically locking a tooltip if it’s been open for a few seconds, and letting players configure that timing.</p>
<h3><strong>New Appeal Lens</strong></h3>
<p>As we continue to evaluate Happiness and set the foundation for bigger upcoming changes, we’re working to ensure players always have the information they need to read the game. With this update, we’re presenting a new Appeal Lens. This new strategic tool is designed to help you quickly identify which tiles are Breathtaking or Charming, and even help you spot Natural Wonders.</p>
<p>Along with this new tool in <em>your</em> toolbelt, we’ve added a new one to ours. Previously, tiles could either be Appealing or not. Appealing tiles provided Happiness, and the Yield for Happiness scaled by Age. Now, Appealing tiles come in two types: <strong>Charming</strong> and <strong>Breathtaking</strong>. Charming tiles provide base Happiness, while Breathtaking tiles provide increased Happiness, and this value no longer scales by Age.</p>
<p>We hope you use the Appeal Lens to help answer these questions throughout your empire-building:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will I get the Happiness I need to support the Specialists and Buildings in my growing Cities?</li>
<li>Do I want to prioritize expansion towards high-value Natural Wonders?</li>
<li>Do I want to earn extra Happiness to trigger more Celebrations quickly?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Coastal Raid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coastal Raid action for Naval Units has been updated to behave more like the Pillage action.
<ul>
<li>Naval Units can still Coastal Raid the tile they are on, as well as adjacent tiles, but they no longer have the option to Pillage. Coastal Raid can still be used to activate discoveries at range and capture Districts.</li>
<li>Coastal Raiding now provides Yields based on the tile being raided, matching Yields gained when Pillaging that tile. (<em>Previously: Coastal Raid defaulted to granting Gold and Health.)</em></li>
<li>Coastal Raid now also benefits from abilities that increase Pillage Yields. Effects that are intended to only trigger on Pillaging on land will specify Land Units in their description.</li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> We made this change to reduce the redundancy and confusion when Naval Units had access to both Coastal Raid and Pillage. We also took this opportunity to refine how the two actions really worked!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To support this change, the following content was updated:
<ul>
<li>Iceland’s Dróttkvætt Tradition and Vikingr were updated.
<dl><dt>Dróttkvætt</dt><dd>Naval Units grant Culture equal to 50% of Pillage Yields and Healing. <em>(Previously: Coastal Raiding grants Culture equal to 50% the Gold gained.)</em></dd><dt>Vikingr</dt><dd>Iceland Unique Heavy Naval Unit. Grants Science equal to 25% of Pillage Yields and Healing. Has 3 Sight. <em>(Previously: Iceland Unique Heavy Naval Unit. Coastal Raiding grants Science equal to 25% the Gold gained. Has 3 Sight.)</em></dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Descriptions of Wonders, Social Policies, Commander Promotions, and Civ Abilities were updated to clarify whether they apply to Naval or Land Units.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new Appeal Lens.</li>
<li>Appeal’s effect on Happiness has been updated. The way a tile’s Appeal is calculated is unchanged.
<ul>
<li>Appeal is no longer binary, and now has levels. Tiles can be Average, Charming, or Breathtaking. Appeal level determines how much Happiness a tile provides, and Happiness from Appealing tiles no longer scales by Age.
<ul>
<li><strong>Average</strong> tiles continue to not provide Happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Charming</strong> tiles provide +1 Happiness when improved.</li>
<li><strong>Breathtaking</strong> tiles provide +2 Happiness when improved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abilities that previously referred to tiles with a Happiness Yield or a Natural Happiness Yield have been updated to reference Appeal instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI behavior around Diplomacy gameplay has been updated.
<ul>
<li>Diplomatic leaders will more properly use the Military Sabotage Action unlocked in the Diplomatic Attribute tree.</li>
<li>Militaristic leaders will more properly use the Open the Gates Espionage during War, and put more Influence towards War Support.</li>
<li>All leaders befriend Independents slightly more often.</li>
<li>Individual leaders have had specific biases adjusted to better support their gameplay. (Leaders affected include Ben Franklin, Edward Teach, Harriet Tubman, Himiko Queen of Wa, Ibn Battuta, Jose Rizal, Lafayette, Machiavelli, Napoleon Emperor, Sayyida al Hurra, Trung Trac.)</li>
<li>Leaders with City-State centered gameplay more properly Suzerain and Incorporate City-States. (Leaders affected include Lakshmibai, Tecumseh.)</li>
<li>Leaders with Personas have had their personalities slightly differentiated to vary gameplay. (Leaders affected include Ashoka, Friedrich, Himiko, Xerxes.)</li>
<li>Civs have had specific biases adjusted to better support their gameplay. (Civs affected include Greece, Shawnee, Siam, Tonga, Prussia, America, Great Britain, Spain.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diplomacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players will now correctly lose the +1 Gold Effect from Pirate Haven when losing a Trade Route by declaring a War.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed “Rural District" to just “Rural” on various tooltips, effects, descriptions, and Civilopedia articles for better consistency with gameplay logic. These tiles are now simply referred to as “Rural” to avoid confusion with "Districts” or Urban tiles.
<ul>
<li>As part of this change, the effects of both Qajar’s <em>Qullarāqāsi</em> Tradition and Sayyida al Hurra’s leader ability, <em>Hakima Tatwan</em>, now match their descriptions and only apply to Urban Districts.</li>
<li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: We wanted effects like these to be impactful and easily understood, while also not creating odd incentives. As we ramp up to bigger changes, expect us to unify language, make things clearer, and occasionally change abilities such as these to better fit. As always, we will be monitoring balance for Qajar and Sayyida al Hurra and make adjustments when necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players no longer fail to receive +2 Culture from ongoing Diplomatic projects when the Ekklesia Mastery has been completed and a Diplomatic project has been started.</li>
<li>Added Production Adjacency from Wonders for Factories in Modern.</li>
<li><em>Riches of the Duat</em> will no longer provide a +20% production bonus when constructing a Wonder in a city not located in desert terrain.</li>
<li>The bonuses from the "Freyfaxahamar" Storylet are no longer given as a Global Yield when selected. The bonus now correctly applies only towards Settlements that are following the player’s Religion.</li>
<li>The Anjuvannam Unique Building no longer fails to receive Adjacency Bonuses from Coastal tiles when slotting the "Shusei Kokubo" tradition.</li>
<li>Ageless Fortified Districts no longer lose Health and Wall Defense bonus when transitioning to the following Age.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Military</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Communism no longer spawns Naval Ranged Units instead of Land Ranged Units when completed in the Civic Tree.</li>
<li>Naval Units with the Pirate ability are no longer able to be attacked through Fortified districts when targeted by neutral units.</li>
<li>Military Naval Units can now properly capture a Fortified tile when the tile has had all Buildings pillaged.</li>
<li>The Donjon Unique Quarter no longer gives an extra Chevalier Unit when the Normans reconquer a Settlement with a completed Donjon Unique Quarter.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported storylet issue causing Army Commanders to disappear after gaining the reward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved transition VFX for Naval Units.</li>
<li>Addressed a visual issue affecting Shawnee's Unique Unit "Hoceepkileni" model.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Leaders &amp; Civs</strong></h3>
<h4>Leaders</h4>
<ul>
<li>(★ - Community Influence Item) Added new leader Gilgamesh.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Civs</h4>
<p><strong>Mughal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Ability:
<ul>
<li>Paradise of Nations: +100% to all Gold Yields, -25% to all other Yields. (<em>Previously: Paradise of Nations: +75% to all Gold Yields, -25% to all other Yields.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> We’ve been wanting to lean into the asymmetrical nature of the Mughal ability harder and make this a clean 100% bonus for a while, but waited to tweak the whole kit to support this change, as well as get a better sense of how the Modern Age was played by the community. While some abilities technically got debuffed a bit, overall we’ve found this to be a decent boost to making the Mughals feel special.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unique Improvement:
<ul>
<li>Stepwell: +2 Food. +2 Food from adjacent Farms. Must be built on a Flat tile. Cannot be built adjacent to another Stepwell. <em>(Previously: +2 Gold. +2 Food from adjacent Farms. Must be built on a Flat tile. Cannot be built adjacent to another Stepwell.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Since we buffed the Unique Ability to carry the majority of the Gold Bonus, we took the opportunity to focus other parts of their kit on the Food and Rural aspects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traditions:
<ul>
<li>Mayūrāsana: +10% Gold towards purchasing anything. <em>(Previously: +25% Gold towards purchasing anything.)</em></li>
<li>Jins-i Kamil: +1 Food on Farms for each adjacent Plantation, and on Plantations for each adjacent Farm. (<em>Previously: +1 Food and Gold on Farms for each adjacent Plantation, and on Plantations for each adjacent Farm.)</em>
<dl><dt>Dev Note</dt><dd>This is another example of letting this part of the kit guide players to Mughal’s other strengths around Food.</dd></dl>
</li>
<li>Qilachas: +2 Gold on Quarters with Walls. <em>(Previously this ability wasn't working as intended and counted any District with 2 Buildings, instead of Quarters. Quarters are Districts with 2 Ageless or Current-Age Buildings)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Civic Tree:
<ul>
<li>Zabt Tier 1: Unlock the Stepwell. +1 Gold on Farms in Towns. Jins-i Kamil Tradition. (<em>Previously: Unlock the Stepwell. +1 Gold on Farms. Jins-i Kamil Tradition.)</em></li>
<li>Gardens of Paradise Tier 1: You can purchase Wonders with Gold, but they are more expensive. (150%) Mayūrāsana Tradition. (<em>Previously: You can purchase Wonders with Gold. Mayūrāsana Tradition).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dai Viet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Ability
<ul>
<li>Hịch Tướng Sĩ: When you create a Fortification Constructible receive 25 Culture for every Urban Population in that Settlement. (Scales By Game Speed) (<em>Previously: When you create a Fortification Constructible receive 5 Culture for every Urban Population in that Settlement. (Scales By Game Speed)).</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Sometimes, we like to just buff stuff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unique Settler
<ul>
<li>Quận Vương: Unique Settler. When this Unit Settles receive 25 Culture for every Tropical tile within 3 of the City Center (Scales by Game Speed). (<em>Previously: When this Unit Settles receive 5 Culture for every Tropical tile within 3 of the City Center (Scales by Game Speed)).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>French Empire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced Militaristic Attribute for Cultural.
<dl><dt>Dev Note</dt><dd>The French Empire’s focus on Happiness and Government made the Diplomatic Attribute clear, but the rest of their bonuses split pretty evenly between combat and cultural focuses. With the other changes to their kit with this update, we felt it was appropriate to adjust their Attribute accordingly. As we ramp up towards releasing some bigger changes and making Attributes matter more in some contexts, we might adjust a few more civs in future updates. We plan to be very judicious about these shifts!</dd></dl>
</li>
<li>Changed the Grand Armee combat strength effect from Per Adjacent Unit to Traditions slotted in the Government.</li>
<li>Added a Tradition Slot to the French Empire’s final Civic.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Preview: Five Takeaways From My Time With Virtual Boy On Nintendo Switch Online]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/five-takeaways-from-my-time-with-virtual-boy-on-nintendo-switch-online</link>
            <guid>1423963</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Given that fans were expecting (or perhaps hoping, to be more accurate) to see DS games added to Switch Online, the upcoming inclusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> on <strong>17th February 2026</strong> is quite possibly the biggest surprise from Nintendo in recent years.</p>
<p>Did anyone really ask for this? Probably not. Is it pretty neat regardless? Definitely. Although the Virtual Boy's small library of games have been widely playable through, shall we say, 'unofficial' means, the headset itself isn't the easiest piece of hardware to come across these days.</p>
<p>So to finally go hands-on with the upcoming NSO variant of the Virtual Boy headset was both surreal and thrilling. I didn't get a great deal of time with it, but I managed to play enough to come away with five key takeaways. Needless to say, it reinforced my admittedly rash decision to pre-order the full-fat headset at <strong>£66.99 / $99.99</strong>, and I can't wait to get stuck in.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196709 @ 1770133824 -->
<h2><strong>The headset feels high-quality</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="751314974af8a"><a title="Virtual Boy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/751314974af8a/virtual-boy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is probably a given when you consider how much this thing is, but the Virtual Boy headset is really impressive from a build point of view. I was only able to handle it with a Switch 2 console already inserted, but it feels pretty weighty (while not being too heavy) and the dial you use to adjust the headset angle is strong and durable.</p>
<p>Even if you wind up not playing the NSO app all that much, the headset will make for a really eye-catching decoration to place on your desk or shelf. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>If the replica is a little pricey for you, there is also the cardboard version coming on the same day — though I didn't get to try that one out.</p>
<h2><strong>The lack of a Virtual Boy controller sucks</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="d58b52299d9c7"><a title="Virtual Boy Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d58b52299d9c7/virtual-boy-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see Nintendo add this later down the line (gotta squeeze every penny, y’know?), but I think it’s a real shame that the proper Virtual Boy headset doesn’t come bundled with a matching controller. I can understand the cardboard variant not including one, but I really wish we could get the complete Virtual Boy experience if I’m paying top dollar for it.</p>
<p>My hands-on session utilised the Joy-Con 2 nestled within the grip, which wasn't ideal. I suspect using the Pro Controller will provide a better experience, but man… I need a proper Virtual Boy pad.</p>
<h2><strong>Once you fine-tune the screen view, it looks incredible</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="778d140af7dd2"><a title="Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/778d140af7dd2/mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I first wiggled my face into the Virtual Boy’s display, everything looked a bit off. The screen was tiny, and the focus was completely out of whack. I don’t know what the person testing it out before me was doing, but goodness, what a mess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, small software tweaks via certain prompts on the controller (similar to adjusting the controls in other NSO apps) allow you to customise the view, so you can shift the image left or right slightly to increase the focus, and you can increase the size of the screen so that it fits your entire viewpoint. Once you do this, the edges fade out slightly, almost as if they’re exceeding the boundaries of your peripheral vision. It looks really cool.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you wear glasses like I do, you'll probably be absolutely fine using the Virtual Boy. Unless they're massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a>-style frames.</p>
<h2><strong>You’ll need a really specific environment in which to play</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="54fbf2b353c10"><a title="Virtual Boy 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54fbf2b353c10/virtual-boy-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is true for the original Virtual Boy too, but if you want to play this thing for a reasonable length of time, you’ll need to set up the right environment. You can’t play it without placing the VB accessory upon a flat surface, and you’ll need to make sure you’re at the right height so that you’re neither stretching up or crouching down.</p>
<p>Case in point, the Virtual Boy I tried was set upon a counter while I was sat upon a pretty basic high stool. The height of the stool meant that I had to curve my back forwards in order to get low enough to use the headset. If you've ever popped your chin on one of those tonometer machines at the opticians, it's a similar setup. I’m getting old, man, it hurts to do this stuff!</p>
<p>I suspect the ideal solution would be to set it upon a desk, then use a height-adjustable chair to get in the right position. Angling the Virtual Boy to the optimum position does help a lot too, naturally.</p>
<h2><strong>Many of the Virtual Boy’s games are genuinely great</strong></h2>

<p>It’s no secret that the Virtual Boy failed spectacularly when it originally launched back in 1995. As such, you might be under the impression that its games just aren’t very good. Well, not so! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> is an incredible 2D platformer that makes spectacular use of perspective, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a> is a solid wireframe shoot-em-up with clear <strong>Star Fox</strong> inspirations.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to try <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a>, since neither of them will be available at launch. But the sheer fact that both will be fully playable for the first time <em>ever</em> is reason enough to celebrate. What a time to be alive.</p>
