<p>Well here's something that we weren't expecting. Fresh out of New York Comic Con 2025, we got our first peek at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/avatar-legends-the-fighting-game">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game</a> (working title), an upcoming one-on-one fighter heading to Switch 2 in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We don't know all that much about what this one will have in store just yet — heck, the title will almost certainly change in the next 12 months — but the pre-alpha footage is looking pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Avatar Legends will see a roster of fighters from the immensely popular <strong>Last Airbender</strong> and <strong>Legend of Korra</strong> series face off in the ring. We can expect a good bit of elemental combat to keep things feeling fresh, and there's set to be a line-up of support characters for an extra pinch of customisation.</p>
<p>Throw in a single player campaign for good measure, and wrap it all up in a hand-drawn visual style reminiscent of the original anime, and we've got a pretty interesting looking fighter on our hands.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2424420/Avatar_Legends_The_Fighting_Game/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 12 Playable Characters at launch, with many more released via Season Model<br>
- Selectable support characters influence your fighting style and grant special moves<br>
- Unique “Flow System” w/Movement Centric Gameplay<br>
- Single Player Campaign w/Original Narrative<br>
- Combo TrialsGallery Mode<br>
- Best in Class Net Code and Cross Play</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's still a lot more for us to learn about this one in the coming months, but the promise of a Switch 2 release has us intrigued.</p>
