<p>"The work of The Traveler is eternal"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you happened to miss it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is out now on the Switch 2, and it's really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">rather good</a>.</p>
<p>Despite leaning heavily on tried-and-tested survival horror tropes, Bloober Team's latest delivers a fascinating story involving time travel, big helmets, and gross, gooey creatures that have the ability to merge with dead bodies. Gross. If you're a genre fan or you simply enjoy well-told stories, this one might be for you.</p>
<p>To highlight its support for the Switch 2, Bloober Team has concocted an awesome new live-action trailer that showcases the game's two timelines while demonstrating multiple methods of control, including the Switch 2's mouse mode. You can watch it first right here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest new IP from Bloober, with the team recently garnering critical acclaim for its work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake on PS5. It's been confirmed that a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> is also in the works, but we sincerely hope that Bloober is keen to expand the world of Cronos in the future too.</p>

<p>60 minutes of Switch and Switch 2 news</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a8a22963cba0/nintendo-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well it's that time again, folks! Nintendo has announced via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> that yet <em>another</em> Direct presentation will be taking place on <strong>12th September 2025</strong> (yes, that's this Friday), hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> in July and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> in August.</p>
<p>The showcase is set to kick off at <strong>2</strong><strong>pm BST / 3pm CEST / 9am ET / 6am PT</strong> and will provide 60 minutes' worth of news and announcements on games heading to the Switch 2 (and possibly the Switch). You can find the exact time that things get underway in your region below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PDT / 7am MDT / 8am CDT / 9am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CEST / 4pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10pm JST / 9pm AWST / 11pm AEST</li></ul>

<p>As ever, the full presentation will be streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional variant), and we'll also be hosting a stream right here on Nintendo Life, so you can watch along with us and have a good old natter about all of the announcements.</p>

<p>As for what's in store..? Well, who knows. There are known quantities like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, the former of which arguably <em>needs</em> a release date at this point. Probably both of them, actually. But of course, there's likely to be a few brand-new surprises in store for 2026, too.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of Super Mario's 40th Anniversary. Kind of a big deal, y'know? Nintendo announced quite a few neat little things for the plumber's 35th anniversary, including the likes of the <strong>Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros.</strong> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch. We're expecting big things for this latest milestone.</p>
