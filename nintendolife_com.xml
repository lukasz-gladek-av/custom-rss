<p>Core, blimey!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Fireshine Games and developer Pugstorm dazzled us with the gorgeous survival sandbox game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/core_keeper">Core Keeper</a> back in September last year, and today they have announced that more is on the way in the shape of a swanky new Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>Arriving on <strong>28th January</strong>, you can expect this one to feature beefed-up graphical fidelity and frame rate (targeting 60fps), as well as a bunch of visual tweaks in the lighting, shadow, water quality and particle effect departments to keep things looking super sleek.</p>
<p>What's more, the Switch 2 version will include native eight-player co-op — a substantial step up from the original's four — and anyone can get involved with a session, even if you're playing on Switch 1 (assuming the session is being hosted by a S2 player, of course).</p>
<p>And the best part of all: this Switch 2 Edition upgrade will be <em>completely free</em> for those who already own the game on the old hardware!</p>
<p>The good news doesn't end there either. Fireshine Games and Pugstorm have <em>also</em> announced that the free 'Volt &amp; Voltage' update will be arriving on all systems on the very same day. This packs in a new biome to explore, fresh enemy types and bosses, and a bunch of cool new weapons. It promises to be a rather beefy one, so if you've been looking for an excuse to dive back in, this might just be the perfect opportunity.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/core-keeper">our review</a> of the original Switch 1 release, we called Core Keeper "a wonderfully engaging and mysterious survival sandbox that is tough to put down once it gets its hooks in you," and it's certainly one to watch if you're a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terraria">Terraria</a>. Bring on even more in January!</p>

<figure data-uuid="72449c02573ec"><a title="Kir air riders city trial map" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72449c02573ec/kir-air-riders-city-trial-map.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Right, it's been out a week now, so it seems like enough time should have passed that we can start having a little chat about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, and in particular its stellar City Trial mode.</p>
<p><em>"Stellar? It's a chaotic mess!"</em> Indeed it is, and well met, my friend. However, that's exactly why it's so damn good, so stop shouting at me.</p>
<p>Also, it's only a mess when you don't know what you're doing. That's right, and as I tried to impress in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">my 8/10 review</a>, once you know what you're doing in Kirby Air Riders, and once you take that knowledge with you into the online realm...well, it's a surprisingly strategic thing. There's a way to play well and a way to play badly, and luck doesn't come into it nearly as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>, with its back-of-the-pack power-up boosts and blue shell upsets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adrqiyjo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Nope. If you know the score in City Trials, as is the case with any race on any track in this game, you'll reap the rewards directly, and so being able to quickly grab the best power-ups (that's all those ludicrously massive icons that littler the arena) alongside a proper knowledge of the fastest routes, most protected avenues, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-how-to-reach-city-trials-floating-garden-and-floating-island">secret areas</a>, and all that jazz, will make you a winner. Oh, wonderful skill-based racing with a high-skill ceiling - you <em>were</em> hiding in there all along.</p>

<p>So. Given that I'm rightly enamoured with the air riding here, and given that I've been so impressed by a game that manages to remove acceleration control (one of the best bits of driving) whilst still remaining more strategic and engaging than other racers of its ilk, it's shame to have a complaint, but I do.</p>
<p>As we reported a little while back, Kirby Air Riders creator and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> guru Masahiro Sakurai has said that there will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sakurai-has-no-plans-for-kirby-air-riders-dlc-everything-is-here">not be any more DLC for the game</a>. Sad (and also slightly spoiled) face. And it's a sad face because as much as I adore City Trial, I think its biggest strengths are drawn from and highlighted by its map - as a map you have to learn so well.</p>
<p>However, in having to get so very familiar with it to succeed against the best that online play can throw at you, only having the one to play on is something that's gonna limit my time with this one, and maybe, ultimately, bring it to a premature end.</p>
<p>If I was aware of even one new City Trial map coming down the pipeline, I'd be confident in the fact that Kirby Air Riders would remain on my Switch 2 indefinitely. And it still may do, by the way, because I just can't get enough of Rick.</p>
<p><em>Why</em>? Well, because he's a huge and cuddly hamster and I love him. But that's a different story.</p>

<p>No, what I mean is <em>why</em> can't we just have one more map? It's not an issue in any way in the rest of the game's modes, and the minigames that see out a round of City Trial are superb - nothing needs doing there.</p>
<p>Indeed, I fully feel as though Sakurai is being 100% genuine in his "<em>Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start"</em> statement when announcing that DLC was a no-go. I just...can't we just have even one more? (How hard can it be to design a breathtakingly brilliant map that works in solo <em>and</em> online play for player counts that vary wildly? I mean, <em>come on.</em>)</p>
<p>There's a ton of content here when you dig into Air Ride, there's endless reams of stuff to unlock and collect in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-playable-characters-and-how-to-unlock-for-every-game-mode">characters</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-tracks-and-how-to-unlock">tracks</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-machines-and-how-to-unlock">machines</a> in Road Trip, but the very nature of City Trials, with its hyper-fixation on this single (admittedly large and very well thought-out) Skyah map, surely means that it'll only continue to thrive and surprise if they chuck more maps in there for the long-term riders to tuck into.</p>
<p>C'mon, Nintendo. Let us feast on the fun of learning another area inside out whilst crushing our foes in online match-ups.</p>
