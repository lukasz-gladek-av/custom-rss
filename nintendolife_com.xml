<figure data-uuid="45df45825f946"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45df45825f946/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK Charts data is in, and there's honestly very little change in the top ten this week, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> once again claiming the top spot.</p>
<p>In fact, the top eight games have all played a bit of a switcheroo, while the latter two spots in the top ten are taken up by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026 Edition</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> continues its descent down the charts to land at number 17, though with sales skewed heavily in favour of the Switch 2, this perhaps suggests that the hardcore crowd are still picking it up in droves.</p>
<p><strong>Mario Kart</strong> continues to demonstrate its widespread appeal, with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a> once again taking up their positions in the top ten. It'll be interesting to see how long this keeps up as the Switch 2 expands its library further in 2026.</p>
<p>Here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

<p>It's no Fiorentina jersey, but it's something</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="26ca35de83f1c"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26ca35de83f1c/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has a long history of sponsoring professional sports teams, and one club it's continued to support over the years is the Japanese football side, Kyoto Sanga, which currently competes in Japan's top-flight competition known as the J-League.</p>
<p>Nintendo owns 16.6% of this club, <a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/the-story-of-kyoto-sanga-nintendos-favourite-football-team/">and ever since it signed on in 1993</a>, the video game giant's traditional 19th-century kanji logo has appeared on the back of the kit, above the player number. Now, in a slight and subtle update to the shirt for the new season, the logo is surrounded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>.</p>
<p>So, while the traditional logo might not be quite as recognisable here in the west, you can now at least impress fellow Nintendo fans (<em>and maybe some sports ones</em>) with these colourful Pikmin.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15b9952a8d147"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15b9952a8d147/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via @Genki_JPN on X / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Again, while it might not be <em>quite</em> as easy to spot as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2019/09/feature_remember_when_video_game_football_shirts_were_a_big_deal">Nintendo's ACF Fiorentina kit featuring the company's red (and iconic) "racetrack" logo</a>, any fan of Nintendo should definitely notice. As for the rest of the kit, as you can see in the images above, it features the usual purples, white and red colours – matching the club's emblem.</p>
<p>As Nintendo fans should know, Shigeru Miyamoto has a soft spot for Pikmin, and has previously mentioned how he considers them to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/miyamoto-considers-pikmin-to-be-nintendos-most-global-characters">Nintendo's most "global characters"</a>, so it's no surprise they continue to pop up pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>On a <em>slightly</em> related note, Nintendo this week rolled out a new game update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> on the Switch to fix multiple bugs.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/i-skipped-school-to-play-hideo-kojima-cites-super-mario-bros-as-the-reason-he-makes-games</link>

<p>"I can't really play it now though"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hideo Kojima has rightly cemented himself as a legend in the games industry, having created iconic titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">P.T.</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">Death Stranding</a>. Although it probably shouldn't come as a surprise, however, Kojima cites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> as the reason he started making games in the first place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA">new interview</a> with WIRED in which Kojima answers questions submitted online, he's asked which game he has played the most. His immediate answer was Super Mario Bros., claiming to have played it for "a year" when he was a college student. He states that "without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry".</p>
<p>Although he alludes to its simplicity (it was, after all, a launch title for the NES), he says that it pushed him to believe in the potential of games, claiming that "this medium would one day surpass movies".</p>
<p>Here's the full quote from Kojima:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Bros., definitely. Played it for a year. I was a college student. I skipped school to play at home. Without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry... Yeah... I can't really play it now, though.</p>
<p>"It's a side-scrolling action game. Mario just goes left to right. Basically just jumping. But there's a dash button. Using that and jump subtly changes the jump trajectory to attack or dodge. It has almost no story, but it felt like you were on an adventure. When I saw that, although it was pixel art with no story, I felt this medium would one day surpass movies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kojima has recently released <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and is currently working on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/physint">Physint</a> (working title). The original Death Stranding, initially a console exclusive for the PS5, has since been released on everything from the Xbox to the Amazon Luna, leading many to speculate that it might eventually wind up on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Mega Gyarados and Charizard Y join the fray</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>A major game update for the free-to-play Switch and mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_unite">Pokémon Unite</a> was released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, before we get to the end of the year, the development team has added Mega Charizard Y. This follows Mega Gyarados, which joined the fray earlier this month. Before this, trainers got Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Aeos coins have also been discontinued in Pokémon Unite. This took place earlier this month, alongside the introduction of License Journeys – giving trainers a new way to obtain Licenses in Unite.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-unite-is-discontinuing-aeos-coins-in-its-december-game-update">our previous story</a>, and below is the trailer for Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario:</p>

<figure data-uuid="c116a481c1bbb"><a title="Octopath Traveler" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c116a481c1bbb/octopath-traveler.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix released the HD-2D RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, following this, it has provided an update about the lifetime sales of the series – revealing it has now sold over six million copies worldwide. This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/the-hd-2d-series-octopath-traveler-hits-another-sales-milestone">sales update in December last year</a>, when it hit the five million mark.</p>
<p>This latest sales update includes physical copies shipped and each game's digital sales. As part of this, it's also shared some special artwork, and the series will be on sale for a limited time.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler originally began life as a Switch exclusive in 2018 and now has multiple entries <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-pre-registrations-go-live-in-the-west">including a mobile prequel</a>.</p>
