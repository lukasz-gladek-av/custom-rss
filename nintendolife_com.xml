<p>Speaking via social media, the team stated that the delay would "help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver". Though a specific date has not been specified, we can currently expect to see it launch in March 2026.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Development Update for OPUS: Prism Peak</p>
<p>As we move into the final stages of development, we’ve taken a careful look at our schedule and decided to adjust the original release window to make sure the game reaches the level of quality we’re aiming for.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xyojrm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>After revisiting our timeline, we can now confirm that OPUS: Prism Peak is planned for release in March 2026. Thank you so much for your continued support.</p>
<p>We’re truly sorry for the delay. We know this isn’t the news you were hoping for.</p>
<p>But we believe this extra time will help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver.</p>
<p>Everyone at SIGONO is giving their best, and we’re committed to bringing OPUS: Prism Peak to you in its strongest form when it arrives in March 2026.</p>

<p>We covered OPUS: Prism Peak with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/opus-prism-peak-will-capture-your-heart-with-new-teaser">teaser trailer</a> all the way back in 2023, so it's safe to say that this game has been in the public eye for quite some time. Here's hoping it will satisfy fans of the series when it eventually launches in 2026.</p>

Although he puts his all into communicating his work – which is perhaps evident in the lengthy Direct presentations for the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> – he nevertheless refrains from "trying to promote myself":</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adspytgi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I think I've always wanted to live an unassuming life. I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. Becoming a laughing stock on the internet would be problematic. That's why I frequently turn down requests for interviews. I think it's best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems reasonable to us! In addition to his games, Sakurai is also well-known for his work on YouTube. With the 'Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games' channel, he offloads a heap of information about the process of game development for would-be creators. His work proved such a success that he was even listed as a recipient of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/masahiro-sakurai-receives-award-from-japanese-government">Cultural Affairs' annual Art Encouragement Prize for New Artists</a> over in Japan.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders, meanwhile, is out now for the Switch 2. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">8/10 review</a>, we said that it's a "chaotic and frenzied racer", but one that's also "got depth for those who wish to learn".</p>

<p>Ranked Battle Season 3 will kick off on <strong>27th November</strong> at <strong>6am UTC</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>18th December</strong>. Those who reach Rank S or higher in this season can nab themselves a Chesnaughtite which, as you might expect, can be used to evolve Chesnaught into Mega Chesnaught.</p>
<p>What's more, the previous season's Mega Stones will also be up for grabs again this season, with Greninjite being awarded to all those who reach Rank Y and Delphoxite to anyone who hits Rank V. None of these stones are available through normal gameplay, so it's well worth taking part if you're a fan of the Gen VI starters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7ptghqo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
