<figure data-uuid="a0844111deb84"><a title="Pokemon Gen 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0844111deb84/pokemon-gen-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>On 27th February, Pokémon turns 30. That's three whole decades of exploring many and various regions to find monsters, battle monsters, and pocket monsters - and we've all got our personal favourites.</p>
<p>And they're not <em>always</em> just our starter, either! Sure, you build up a special relationship with your first Pokémon each generation, but there are usually a half-dozen winners who work their way into your good books as well as your team - and maybe even your <em>heart</em>, assuming you're not a cold Rock-type (and they can be awesome, too!).</p>
<p>In honour of this momentous anniversary, we'll be running a series of polls leading up to the big day where we get your votes for your favourite Pokémon from each generation. Then, we'll pit the winners against each other in a final nine-generation showdown to find out Nintendo Life readers' very favourite Pokémon from the <del>7 million</del> 1,025 discovered thus far.</p>
<p>We'll be covering a generation every day for the next nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown between the top 'mons at the end of the month. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days after going live.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/02/feature_best_pokemon_starters_from_all_gens_as_voted_by_you">We've looked at starters before</a>, and they're bound to poll well. We hear <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/03/random_new_study_uncovers_the_most_popular_pokemon_by_country">Pikachu's pretty popular</a>, too?</p>
<p>While the choice is yours and we certainly don't wish to influence your decision, we feel a duty to remind you of some less obvious picks from each gen. So let's quickly ask Team NL for some underdog candidates they'll consider before casting their vote. Team?</p>




<hr>
<p>Okay, that's more than enough ado - here's the poll featuring all 151 Gen 1 Pokémon in National Dex order. Remember, you can only choose one, so pick wisely!</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Keep an eye out for further generations in the coming days as we cruise towards Pokémon's 30th anniversary at the end of February!</em></p>

            <guid>1436113</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="b8488ed239f00"><a title="Turtle Beach Rematch Switch 2 Review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b8488ed239f00/turtle-beach-rematch-switch-2-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Turtle Beach's original Rematch Wireless is what I'd call a decent and dependable budget pad, and around what you'd expect for your money. It looked and felt surprisingly premium in its buttons, its responsive D-Pad, and in its many different designs.</p>
<p>Now, Turtle Beach is back with the cunningly-named 'Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller For Switch 2', which brings pretty much exactly the same fully-licensed controller back to the table. Except! This time it's got a flashy new design featuring Mario (never heard of him) and some flash semi-translucent grips. Oh yes. Much more importantly, though, it's also got itself a 'C' button. Yes, that weird little button that I've never used. It has one of those!</p>

<p>I jest, of course. I'm sure lots of people are having a great time with the chat functions and whatnot on Switch 2, and this revamp gives us a controller, still in the same budget ballpark (£54.99), that feels like a nice alternative to the more expensive official Pro Controller 2 from Nintendo if £75 is out of your price range.</p>
<p>I alternated between the Switch 2 Pro Controller and this new Rematch for my review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> (as they are the only C-button-wielding pads I own, and that's how you do science, you see) and obviously the big difference here is that lack of rumble support. It's one of those things I really struggle to do without nowadays, especially when you can feel the difference in shots and power. But taking this omission as a given, I've been mostly impressed by the rest of both the build quality and the overall feel of this pad.</p>
<p>It's got stiffer face buttons than the Pro Controller which feel good in their own way - very responsive and firm, there's no mistake in pressing them and no mushiness. They're a nice match for a robust D-pad that sits up nicely from the controller face and clicks through its points more noticeably than the more expensive Pro. It's personal preference with a lot of this stuff, but I do appreciate being able to feel every point being reached so I don't ever have to check my bearings as I play, especially in fighting games.</p>

<p>In terms of weight, as this is a USB-C-charged affair with no removable battery, and given the lack of rumble tech in there, it feels very light. Again, I'm actually a big fan because my wrists are made of haunted dust, but it does feel slightly 'cheaper' (because it is?) than the Pro.</p>
<p>Speaking of the battery, the official details tell me you get 40 hours on a single charge, and being that I've played an entire review game with it and just one other pad, and with no recharges required, I'm gonna go ahead and say I definitely got 30+ hours out of that single charge thus far.</p>
<p>The TMR sticks feel great, as expected, the home and screenshot buttons are well-placed just above your menu buttons, and that all-important 'C' button takes centre stage, because why wouldn't it? I should also mention that I love the big red clacky extra buttons on the back. They feel a little less primo than the dinky little hidden ones on the Pro Controller, but they are much easier to find and to tell that you've pressed on them at all. The Pro is a little mushy in this regard.</p>
<p>In your hands, the Rematch is bigger on its rear side and slightly flatter on the front than the Pro, which makes for a better grip overall for me, and between the two I also have to give this pad the nod for its triggers. I love the shape of these, as they flick upwards rather than tailing off like the ones on the Pro, making them easier to find blind and, well, they just feel more 'trigger-y', meaning your finger stays on there and doesn't start sliding when things get intense in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> or what have you.</p>

<p>Other things of note. You can use this controller with your OG Switch. There's no 3.5mm jack. Boo! But there are motion controls smuggled in to sweeten the deal. Hooray! Well. Sort of hooray.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with this thoroughly decent controller, you see, is that for just a <em>little</em> bit extra cash, you could nab something better. If you're on a super-duper strict budget, or simply must have this design in your collection, things are different, but considering this one is retailing at <a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/rematch-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2">£54.99 on the official site</a> and I could pick up the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">8BitDo Pro 3</a> for less with a little searching, it gets complicated fast. The Pro 3 gives you TMR sticks, Hall-Effect Triggers, <em>and</em> rumble support. You see the issue. Even if you don't like the Dualshock-apeing style of the Pro 3, there's also the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-ultimate-no-but-decent-doesnt-have-the-same-ring">Ultimate Wireless/Bluetooth 2</a> to consider, which again I can find online for similar money right now.</p>

<p>This controller can't wake up the console, and it also has no rumble/amiibo-scanner to boot. So, whilst you get a nice licensed pad that feels great, looks great, plays great, and has got that C-button, it's possible to get alternatives with other bells and whistles for cheaper.</p>
<p>If you love the livery or if that C-button is a must for your amazingly social gaming lifestyle, then this is a very solid pad, so long as you can make do with the omissions I've noted.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was greedy and wrapped up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> way quicker than I was expecting last weekend, so I am officially <em>Between Games TM</em> at the moment. I’ve been enjoying working my way through some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario’s Super Picross</a> on the NSO library to chill out, and I imagine this weekend will bring more of the same!</p>
<p>While I can’t really believe that I’m saying it, I’m also quite keen to check out some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overwatch">Overwatch</a> this weekend. I missed the boat when it first launched, but all of this new content has me intrigued.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This week, I have jetlag. I tried to play games that required even a little bit of brain, and it did not go well (it was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, for the record. Not even a particularly cerebral game! I'm just very tired).</p><p>

I've been making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>, as I will be for the rest of my life, and now I'm somewhere around 25 endings. Maybe more. Also, <strong>Titanium Court</strong>, which is not out yet, but I have an early code because I'm a jammy lad, and it's VERY good, so look forward to that one (although... I'm not sure if it's due out on Switch. Sorry). Also, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> (which IS out on Switch, and you should play it) and watching my partner play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a>, after a year of me going PLAY IT PLAY IT PLAY IT. So that's very fun.</p><p>

But I'm looking for something meaty to play after finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Another JRPG, perhap? Recommendations always welcome.</p></div>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I’ve not had much time to play this week as I’ve been under the weather, however I predict this weekend will be spent gaming in bed. It’s only fitting with it being Valentine’s Day on Saturday that my fiancee and I replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> together.</p>
<p>Saying that, I’m still on the mission of becoming less of a wimp and with the recent <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a> trailer, I might just jump into a horror game from my backlog. I’m sure I can dust off something from my collection. Perhaps <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_4_wii_edition">Resident Evil 4</a> on Wii? Wish me luck…I think motion controls are scarier than Las Plagas!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still completely addicted to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> at the moment, though I did briefly test out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a> after its recent update, and I can confirm that MGS2 and 3 now run like a dream on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So yes, it's likely that I'll be spending a bit of time with Solid and Naked Snake this weekend, playing their two best adventures as intended. It took a while, but Konami finally pulled through.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Apart from a new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, Capcom's new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> also made an appearance at PlayStation's 'State of Play' this week.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer titled 'World View' gives us another glimpse at a recreation of New York, and also adds some backstory about the game's protagonist Hugh. This trailer ends on a bit of a shocking note, with Hugh and his android companion Diana being chased by an enemy threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hugh and Diana as they traverse a 3D printed Times Square-like area, dominated by massive structures. What mysteries await them in this twisted lunar cityscape?"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already tried it out, there's a demo for Pragmata on the Switch 2 eShop that you can download right now. Capcom also announced earlier this week that this same demo has now reached one million "combined" downloads across all platforms.</p>
<p>This new hacking and shooting game will arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>24th April 2026</strong>. Will you be picking it up on release? Have you tried out the demo yet? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-pinball-machine-officially-revealed-by-stern-pinball-available-now</link>
            <guid>1436032</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>As part of Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations, Stern Pinball has now officially revealed its new Pokémon pinball machine.</p>
<p>It's available right now in "pro", "premium" and "limited edition" models. The limited edition is "limited" to 750 units globally, and prices range between $6,999 - $12,999, depending on the model. If you're interested, or happen to be a business owner, you can <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">contact Stern on its website</a> to find out about the availability of these machines and more details.</p>

<p>This machine promises to take trainers on an "unforgettable journey" across four distinct habitats as they battle their way through rival trainers and Team Rocket. It also integrates video clips from the original animated series, including the official theme song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game begins with the player entering a random biome: forest, water, mountain, or desert. By hitting the ball at the proper targets on the board, you’ll discover, catch, and train new Pokémon partners. Occasionally, you’ll encounter the troublesome Team Rocket, and you’ll need to prevent them from capturing Pokémon during a frantic multiball sequence.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve scored enough points and completed specific activities in a biome, you’ll be able to take on a Gym Battle against a rival party of Pokémon. Complete all the biomes’ Gym Battles, and you’ll enter the Pokémon Arena. There’s even an opportunity to face off against Team Rocket’s boss, Giovanni, but only the most skilled pinball wizards are likely to make it that far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The premium and limited edition versions of the machine also feature an interactive electromagnet that "adds chaos" to the battle arena.</p>
<p>As part of the whole experience, trainers can use Stern's app to document the Pokémon they catch. Here's a bit about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Utilizing Stern Pinball’s award-winning Insider Connected, <em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball elevates the experience by connecting Trainers and their adventures across machines and locations. When Trainers play Pokémon by Stern Pinball signed in with their Stern Insider Connected Account, the Pokémon they CATCH will be added to their Insider Connected Pokémon Collection, which can be viewed in the Insider Connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're curious to see it in action, <a href="https://youtu.be/mJKxHwMiCJM">YouTube channel The Pinball Company</a> has gone hands on with the new Pokémon machine. The <a href="https://youtu.be/Z-g8SDhfWVc">YouTube channel Foxcitiespinball</a> has also uploaded a video of the Stern team explaining the new machine and the design.</p>
