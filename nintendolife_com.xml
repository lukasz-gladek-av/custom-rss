            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> locked in a June release last week, and alongside this news, the team has also revealed multiple save data bonuses if you own certain other Square Enix titles.</p>
<p>As long as you've got existing save data (or for certain platforms, purchase history on the same player account), you should be able to unlock these bonuses. It's noted how demo save data for titles "may also fulfill the bonus eligibility requirements".</p>
<p>The save data eligible includes saves from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/various_daylife">Various Daylife</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">TRIANGLE STRATEGY</a>. Here's the full rundown from Square Enix's official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Guidance of the Sacred Flame" - Increases sword damage dealt to enemies with 30% or lower vitality by 10%."</p>
<p><strong>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Critical Hit" - Increases sword critical-hit rate by 6%."</p>
<p><strong>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Brave" - Increases sword damage dealt by 10%. Uses a little more shield stamina when guarding."</p>
<p><strong>VARIOUS DAYLIFE</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Expeditionary Wisdom" - Reduces sword charge time by 10%."</p>
<p><strong>TRIANGLE STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p>"Sword magicite "Counter Stance" - Increases sword damage dealt by 10% while shield stamina is 90% or greater."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Square Enix further note how save data for an "eligible title" must be on the same Switch 2 console. And if you're playing the game on Switch 2, and the applicable data is on an original Switch system, that data must be transferred to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>These save data bonuses can apparently be claimed at "any time", even if the save data for one of these titles is created <em>after</em> starting the Adventures of Elliot. As for the length of this promotion, it's taking place at the time of "release" but this does not guarantee it will be a permanent distribution or service, according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Here's how you can claim these items in-game when it launches for the Switch 2 on <strong>18th June 2026</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to claim the bonus items:</strong></p>
<p>- Select the Promotional Bonus option from The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales’ title screen and link with any corresponding titles.</p>
<p>- Linking occurs automatically by opening the relevant screen.</p>
<p>- After starting a new game, examine the desk on the second floor of the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping.</p>
<p>- Select Claim bonuses from the menu options to claim the qualifying bonuses from the list.</p>
<p>- Please note that bonuses cannot be claimed at certain points in the game when the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping becomes temporarily inaccessible.</p>
<p><em>- Departure Brooch - Increases the amount of tul (in-game currency) and magicite fragments dropped by enemies by a little</em></p>

<p>Oh, and it's got one other game planned for 2026</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="ee576a7524a55"><a title="Romeo Is A Dead Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee576a7524a55/romeo-is-a-dead-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Grasshopper Manufacture</em></figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture, the developer known for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/no_more_heroes">No More Heroes</a> series, launches its new game <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a></strong> on multiple platforms today, but this doesn't include Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>If you have been wondering about the chances of this new title getting a Switch release, we've got another update. During a special five-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/f_PObigha-w">'Grasshopper Direct' broadcast</a> earlier on, company CEO Goichi Suda (aka Suda51) reiterated how the team is doing what it can to make a "Switch 2 version" happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're doing what we can to make it happen, so again, please give us a little more time."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This actually follows a comment Suda51 made last December, mentioning how the team wanted to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/">bring the game to the Switch 2</a> but needed to make sure Unreal Engine 5 was "going to play nicely" with the new hybrid system, so it was testing everything out.</p>
<p>This update today also followed the news that Grasshopper is currently in talks with multiple parties about a "physical version" of the title.</p>
<p>And in one other surprising piece of news shared by Suda, it's been revealed the developer is "almost 100% certain" it will be releasing "one more game" in 2026. As for the details about this new project, the team can't reveal any information just yet, but another announcement should take place "soon".</p>

<p>If you haven't already seen our review here on Nintendo Life, we've given this new entry a score of eight out of ten. While it might be a bit slim in the single-player Adventure Mode, there's still a lot to like about it. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The adventure mode is a letdown, and solo players don't have a ton of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
