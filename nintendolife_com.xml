<p>And it's coming to Switch this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Onion Games has shared the Western release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stray_children">Stray Children</a>, a childlike RPG where a young boy is transported into the world of a retro RPG and encounters a world where only children live. And it's finally coming out in the West on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar, well, it should! Onion Games is the team behind the rerelease of the cult classic PS1 RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/moon">Moon</a>, which similarly transported your character inside the world of a video game.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the devs at Onion Games worked on the original 1997 release; the team is primarily made up of Yoshiro Kimura (director and game designer), Kurashima Kazuyuki (art director), and Hirofumi Taniguchi (composer), whose credits include <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/rule_of_rose">Rule of Rose</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/chulip">Chulip</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/little_kings_story">Little King's Story</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a>. That's an eclectic mix!</p>
<p>But Stray Children seems to be very much in the same vein as Moon, an oddball RPG which subverts genre tropes. Moon is probably most famous for inspiring Toby Fox and Undertale nowadays, and you can see those elements even clearer here.</p>
<p>Instead of battling enemies outright, you can choose to whisper in the ear of the Olders — described as "monstrous adults carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and the many other grievances that all grown-ups gather." Oh geez, way to call us out, Onion Games...</p>

<p>You can choose to make them laugh, smile, or tell them you love them, but don't expect to win them over immediately. There will be plenty of strange and unique interactions throughout as you attempt to save the kids from the Olders. And if Moon is anything to go by, this will certainly be a bit of an odd one.</p>
<p>October is already packed full of amazing games, but this one could be one to look out for. Especially if you loved Moon (like this writer did). It's not for everyone, but there's nothing else quite like it.</p>

<p>Switch 2 Title Update 2 generally focuses on graphical and visual stability along with a few bug and UI fixes. We won't say no to that, especially just under a month since its release.</p>
<p>To pick out just a few bullet points from the patch notes, Kay's movement now looks better "under certain conditions", those using GameChat should no longer experience flicker, and graphical issues where Cinematic display mode wouldn't display correctly in certain scenes have now been resolved.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6EOKFq0qA_o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60cf74yksliz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

We're glad to see Outlaws has gotten a second lease of life on the hybrid console.</p>

<figure data-uuid="359d1c7cb03bc"><a title="Sonic CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359d1c7cb03bc/sonic-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/54299">Famitsu</a> has published the latest boxed charts for Japan, and we've got a few newcomers this week to mix up the top ten.</p>
<p>In pole position is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> for the PS5, which starts strong with 57,475 units sold. Not too far behind, however, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, adding another 35,027 to its running total. In fact, the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> couldn't keep up with Nintendo's kart racer, and lands at number 9 with 5,571 units sold.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Sonic's appeal in Japan isn't quite on par with Western audiences, and it's equally just as likely that folks are simply waiting for the Switch 2 version, which is due to launch later this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> also makes its debut, with the Switch version beating the PS5 version to sell 10,425 copies in its launch week.</p>
<p>Here's the full lowdown on the top ten for this week:</p>
