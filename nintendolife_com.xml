<p>We are under a week away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> on Switch 2 on <strong>5th March</strong>, but that hasn't stopped The Pokémon Company from revealing a <em>little</em> more info as a part of today's Presents showcase.</p>
<p>If you weren't already sold on the adorable vibes of Pokopia from everything we've seen so far, this brand-new trailer isn't going to change your mind. If, however, you were already on board, then we just know that you're going to love meeting DJ Rotom and Chef Dente — a culinary Greedent who wears a large pot on his head.</p>
<p>The stereo Rotom is your go-to aux guy for Pokopia and can swallow up any CDs you happen to stumble across to change your crafting soundtrack to whatever takes your fancy. We heard tunes like 'Pallet Town Theme', 'The Academy', 'Fortree City', and 'Road to Cerulean City' in the trailer, and all of those empty slots promise more to be collected, too.</p>
<p>Your Greedent pal is around to expand your cooking skills. Each Pokémon you come across has different tastes and favourites, so you'll want to learn as many recipes as possible to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also showcased a little more of the multiplayer content, highlighting how you'll be able to choose select Pokémon to journey to a friend's island and assist with their crafting. You can even play hide-and-seek with your pals by morphing into everyday objects and scattering around the island — oh gosh, we're going to spend <em>too much</em> time doing that.</p>
<p>There are just a few days to go before we all get our hands on this one, and yes, the new trailer has left us even more excited.</p>

<p>At last, we're getting another Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch Online! And it's the cult favourite RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_xd_gale_of_darkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a> on GameCube.</p>
<p>Coming to the GameCube Nintendo Classics library — meaning it's exclusive to the Switch 2 — in <strong>March 2026</strong>, XD: Gale of Darkness is the second of two RPG-style spin-offs that released on the purple box. Interestingly, it lands <em>before</em> its predecessor Pokémon Colosseum, which is also due to come to the service.</p>
<p>And just like Colosseum, XD: Gale of Darkness is all about catching Shadow Pokémon, with the main focus being Shadow Lugia.</p>

<p>Too much water</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company wrapped up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/watch-pokemon-presents-february-2026-live">today's Presents</a> with the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>, the new mainline games in the series.</p>
<p>We don't have anything specific on the release date front at the moment, though TPC confirmed that the games will receive a "global simultaneous release" at some point in <strong>2027</strong>.</p>
<p>This was more than we expected for a first peek! Aside from some panning shots of the new region (complete with its fair share of water-y areas, naturally), the trailer also introduced the game's three starters: <strong>Browt</strong>, <strong>Pombon</strong>, and <strong>Gecqua</strong>.</p>
<p>There was also the tease of underwater exploration (hello, Gen III fans), and Pikachu in some rather swanky summer outfits — they are characters in their own right called Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu (yes, really).</p>
<p>Here's a bit more info about the upcoming titles' region and differences from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/see-the-new-trailer-for-pokemon-winds-and-pokemon-waves-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">The Pokémon Company</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves. The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times.</p>
<p>Your main character will sport a different outfit depending on which version of the game you play—and of course, you’ll set out with one of three first partner Pokémon. Will you choose a Grass type by partnering with Browt, the lively but clumsy Bean Chick Pokémon? Or perhaps you’ll heat things up with a Fire type by picking Pombon, the guileless and friendly Puppy Pokémon. If Water types are more your speed, then the intelligent Water Gecko Pokémon, Gecqua, might be the partner for you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The best news, in our eyes, is that it actually appears to be running pretty well. Sure, the environments look a <em>little</em> sparse at the moment, but the promise of all those different biomes, the exclusive mention of a Switch 2 release (at the time of writing), and the fact that there's still another <em>year</em> of development time for Game Freak to tinker away leaves us cautiously optimistic.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon-Themed Mini Game Boy Announced, Though It's Not What You Think]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-themed-mini-game-boy-announced-though-its-not-what-you-think</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a mini Game Boy as part of its 30th anniversary Pokémon Presents, but it's not quite what you might have in mind.</p>
<p>The Game Boy Jukebox / Game Music Collection is a small music player themed after Nintendo's Game Boy into which you slot one of 45(!) mini Pokémon Red or Blue cartridges, which unlock one track each from the original 1996 games.</p>
<p>On the 'inside' face of the carts are pictures showing screenshots from the games corresponding to the track they play.</p>

<figure data-uuid="34f5e0e830eef"><a title="Pokémon Game Music Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34f5e0e830eef/pokemon-game-music-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Shown off in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/watch-pokemon-presents-february-2026-live">Pokémon Presents</a> in a segment with original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Blue</a> composer Junichi Masuda, he said that they "took particular care to make the audio sound just like a Game Boy".</p>
<p>It's available from today (27th February 2026) from the Pokémon Center in North America and the UK, but not from the German, Australian or New Zealand branches. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/">the Pokémon Center website</a> has a message saying to "Check Back Later Today to Get the Game Boy Jukebox".</p>
<p>Here are a couple of pictures of the genuine article. As you can see, it has the product code GBG-01, a nod to the original Game Boy's DMG-01. We've asked if it has a headphone jack and were told that it doesn't.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/gameboy_musiccollection/ja/">official Japanese website</a> for the device shows off that region's cart and box art for Pokémon Red and <del>Blue</del> Green and lists the price as 9,900 yen — approximately $64 / £47 — and it's being sold via a lottery in that region, with expected shipping coming in late March. It's explicitly shown off as a keychain adornment on the site, too, so it's clear that this is a novelty device and not something for chiptune audiophiles.</p>
<p>It is stated to run on 3 LR44 alkaline button cell batteries. Here are the device's dimensions courtesy of Google Translate, if you're interested in that sort of thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Main Unit: W5.2 x H8.65 x D1.98 cm (2.2" x 3.6" x 0.6")<br>
Cartridge (45 cartridges): W3.3 x H3.7 x D0.5 cm (1.3" x 1.7" x 0.5"), approximately 5g per cartridge<br>
Collection Box: W19.3 x H19.5 x D7 cm (7.2" x 7.6" x 0.7")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Interested in picking this up? We'll update this article with more information on the Western release as soon as we find out the details, including the price.</em></p>
