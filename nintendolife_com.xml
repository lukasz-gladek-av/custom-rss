<figure data-uuid="cb5b5a86655b2"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb5b5a86655b2/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has officially lifted the lid on the live-action looks for Zelda and Link in the upcoming Zelda movie with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/official-zelda-movie-photos-give-us-our-best-look-yet-at-link-and-zelda">trio of official photos</a> (compared to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/rumour-zelda-movie-production-set-footage-has-supposedly-leaked-online">leaked 'on-set' footage</a> that appeared online days before).</p>
<p>We've got our first look at Benjamin Evan Ainsworth's Link and Bo Bragason's Princess Zelda in their full Hylian garb, and while it's far from a detailed look at either, there's no denying that some video game inspo has gone into the design choices — who would have thought it!</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the Hero of Hyrule himself, and we're not the only ones getting some serious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess">Twilight Princess</a> vibes from his look, are we? The dark green tunic is a series staple — with some exceptions, obvs — but that cream undershirt paired with the leather fingerless gloves and cross-body strap has a strong whiff of the shape-shifting grittiness we first saw back in 2006.</p>
<p>We can't make out any chainmail from this first look, mind you, <em>and</em> the signature hat is missing, so we'll throw in a <em>little</em> mention for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> Champion's Tunic while we're here. Sure, it's green instead of blue, but the detailing around the collar gives a certain Switch-y flare to the whole thing.</p>

<p>Zelda's live-action reimagining isn't quite as clean-cut in its game inspirations as Link's, but the blue dress is straight out of the BOTW/<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a> lookbook. It's missing some of the elements that really made those designs <em>pop</em> — the white and gold detailing, the chunkiness of the belt, <em>the cape</em> (in TOTK's case) — but the colour palette certainly presents a more modern look for the princess than the classic pink ballgowns of old.</p>

<p>Of course, a feature-length runtime means that there will likely be plenty of room for different looks besides those we've seen in today's snaps, but we're pretty impressed with this initial glance — even if we do wish that Zelda's get-up was a <em>little</em> more detailed.</p>
<p>The big question is, what do you make of these live-action looks? You can let us know in the following polls, but then take to the comments to share what you like, and what you'd change.</p>
