<p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a>, which will be coming to Switch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> for <strong>$39.99 / £34.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right, this is <em>not</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tales_of_xillia_2">Tales of Xillia 2</a>, which series director <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/tales-of-xillia-2-remastered-on-the-way-with-more-to-come">Yusuke Tomizawa previously teased was "still in progress"</a>, just not formally announced. Guess we'll have to wait a bit longer for that one...</p>
<p>Still, Berseria is a <em>bit</em> of a surprise, given that it's available on PC and PS4 (and PS3 in Japan). So it's relatively accessible, unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Graces f</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Xillia</a>, which were stuck on the PS3.</p>
<p>But hey, Tales of Berseria is a good one! It's also much darker than the other games in the series, following Velvet on a quest for revenge after she's struck by tragedy at the hands of a person she trusts. The Remastered version will bring with it various quality-of-life enhancements, early access to the Grade Shop, map icons, the ability to turn off encounters, and access to a bunch of DLC.</p>


<p>The cast is great, the combat is great, and we're excited to try it on Switch. Of course, expect the usual caveats with the Switch port such as 30fps. When will one of these get a dedicated Switch 2 version, Bamco?</p>
<p>Tales of Berseria originally released back in 2017 in the West, and it got a great review from out sister site Push Square, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/tales_of_berseria">who scored it an 8/10</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="17dd7efc036ac"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17dd7efc036ac/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After 105+ minutes of gameplay and breakdowns, we have finally arrived at the launch week for Masahiro Sakurai's latest joint, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>The game is mere hours away from boosting onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong> (that's tomorrow!), and that means that it's time to take a look at the reviews and give you a summary of all the different opinions out there.</p>
<p>We'll start with our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">review</a>, naturally, where the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granted Air Riders a 'Great' 8/10, praising the sheer amount of content and depth of the racing — once you get your head around what's going on. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193790 @ 1763564402 -->
<p>But are we alone in our admiration? Let's take a look around the web and find out...</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a whopping 9/10 review from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-2-best-racer-791012-20251119">GamingBible</a>, where the outlet enjoyed just about everything the game had to offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> may fall short in terms of track selection compared to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t the best racing game released this year, and one of the best first-party Nintendo games to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/">The Gamer</a> opted for a 4/5, giving particular respect to City Trial mode and the game's overall presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more so than the kart racing adjacent Air Ride, City Trial isn’t for everyone, and I can see a lot of people being put off by how relentlessly hectic and loud it can become. Still, as a connoisseur for carnage, I can’t wait to keep playing online and get wrecked by real players instead of CPU bots</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On much the same page, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/">VGC</a> also awarded Air Riders a 4/5, even if it conceded that Road Trip, not City Trial, is the standout mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this combines for a game that appears almost insultingly simple at first – virtually any action except for the special attack is performed with a single button – but hides a hidden depth in its vehicle diversity and special moves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These good times continued in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">IGN</a>'s 8/10 review, where the outlet sang the praises of the game's scope and strangeness, but felt the overall formula and controls didn't stack up to multiplayer mayhem elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest hurdle to enjoying its dizzying amount of content is how it all controls, as its frantic pace and slippery one-button control scheme is endearingly novel, but occasionally too simple for its own good</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/kirby-air-riders-review">GFinity</a> went marginally lower in its 7/10 review, appreciating the frantic excitement of it all, but feeling slightly let down by some game modes and the generally overwhelming nature of the race structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a game that fully embraces its mayhem, with it rather unapologetically overloading your senses. Sometimes that’s overwhelming, sometimes it’s confusing, but more often than not, it makes Kirby Air Riders uniquely entertaining</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, for a contrasting opinion, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro</a> wasn't as keen on Air Riders, giving it a 4/10 after struggling to get on with just about every game mode on offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then Kirby Air Riders is the game for you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Kirby Air Riders is sitting on a 78 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score based on 64 critic reviews. Hey, at least there's not long to wait until we all get to go hands-on with the full game tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>With three weeks to go until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC drops, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has unveiled its next brand new Mega Evolution, and this time it's a Mythical Pokémon getting an upgrade.</p>
<p>Zeraora was first introduced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_ultra_sun_and_ultra_moon">Pokémon Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon</a>, way back in Gen VII, and its Mega form makes a few subtle changes to its original design.</p>
<p>Its mostly-yellow fur has turned black, and there's now a lot more blue on its knees, head, and chest. its blue tuft on its head has turned to something resembling a horn, and it has a few blue spikes across its body in general. And, lastly, it now has two ponytail-like features instead of one.</p>
<p>It's definitely one of the lighter Mega Evolutions we've seen so far, especially compared to Mega Chimecho, but hey! The Thunderclap Pokémon has its fans.</p>

<p>According to the Pokédex, "The electric energy it stores in its body is equivalent to ten bolts of lightning. Protrusions on its forehead, chest, back, and the backs of its hands are where the electric energy is particularly concentrated."</p>
<p>We'll be getting one more Mega Dimension update in two more weeks (2nd December), which will likely be another Mega Evolution. Stay tuned until then!</p>
