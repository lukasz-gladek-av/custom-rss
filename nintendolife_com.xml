<figure data-uuid="3637316fa58ad"><a title="Animal Crossing: Wild World - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3637316fa58ad/animal-crossing-wild-world-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Testing, testing. Is the Animalese-to-English translator up and running? It is? Good. Welcome back to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Last time</a>, we put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> under the microscope, and it was a pretty close-run contest. The North American / European design <em>just</em> clinched the win, in the end, with 58% of the vote, leaving the Japanese variant with 42%.</p>
<p>We've got Animal Crossing on the mind this week (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">why on Earth could that be?</a>), so we're matching up two covers from the wonderful DS entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/animal_crossing_wild_world">Wild World</a>. Looking back on it today, Wild World is a somewhat slight experience when compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">New Horizons</a>, but back in the mid-2000s, it was a beauty. It was Animal Crossing <em>on the go</em>! What a concept!</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fukzpgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There are just two designs to check out this week, so let's get to it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:100046,193209 @ 1762081204 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26c0bab9dd418"><a title="Animal Crossing: Wild World - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26c0bab9dd418/animal-crossing-wild-world-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6281-animal-crossing-wild-world">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're all familiar with this one, right? The Western design is, well, it's a world. What's more, it's adorable. Just look at those polygonal little guys going about their lives! It crams in a good amount of series iconography, too, with plenty of familiar faces, stores and floating packages. It's just a very pleasing cover to look at.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e5dc7f0d8011e"><a title="Animal Crossing: Wild World - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5dc7f0d8011e/animal-crossing-wild-world-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6281-animal-crossing-wild-world">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design is similar, but different. Rather than present the world as a cohesive whole, this cover bisects it, pushing the characters from the Western box art to the top and bottom. All of the characters are still present and correct, but a few crop up in different positions to account for the division — get off the roof, Celeste!</p>
<p>It all leaves more room for the central logo, it's true, but we miss the sense of unity brought by seeing the world as a whole. Maybe that's just us, though.</p>

<p>Online Arcade is also "coming soon"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Digital Eclipse launched its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> this week, and while it's a good history lesson, the team already has plans to improve certain aspects of it.</p>
<p>This starts with a patch dropping today on Steam, with "other platforms" to follow next week. This update will come with audio improvements, improvements for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a> and some stability improvements for the Genesis titles.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown about this latest hotfix via the official Steam game page, and "additional fixes" are planned to be addressed in the coming days in "another update".</p>
<h2>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection - Hotfix (Coming soon)</h2>
<p>The following issues have been addressed in this hotfix update:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved audio buffer for online play</em></li>
<li><em>Restore missing audio in 32X MKII</em></li>
<li><em>General improvements to MK4</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed issue that caused UMK3 to reboot after Scorpion fatality</em></li>
<li><em>General stability improvements for Genesis titles</em></li>
<li><em>Pause button hold time reduced by 50%</em></li>
<li><em>One-Button Fatalities added for all arcade titles</em></li>
<li><em>General stability updates to Music Player</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">In case you missed our review</a>, the team has also outlined a future update for "lobbies and online play", including the Online Arcade, which is "coming soon". This mode has also been detailed on the <a href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/media/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-launch-faq">official FAQ page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will add Online Arcade, a system where you can create lobbies, choose the players, and rotate games for the tastes of your private group of friends. We're finalizing the UI details on these features now.</p>
<p><strong>Will Online Arcade allow players to create private lobbies for online play?</strong>‍</p>
<p>Online Arcade will give players the opportunity to create private or public rooms, select the games they want to play, and invite friends to join in. Each room can host up to 16 players, and multiple games can be played simultaneously; think of it as your personal Mortal Kombat game room, filled with just the games you love most. On individual games within the room, players rotate playing in a classic arcade "winner stays" queue structure or they can choose to simply spectate.</p>
<p>‍This Online Arcade feature is much more robust than Quick Match and is more ambitious than what Digital Eclipse has done in its previous games, so it demands additional testing both internally and from external partners before it's ready for players to enjoy. We expect this feature to be added via an update within a few weeks after launch, but this is dependent on internal and first-party approval timeframes, which can vary between platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for crossplay support, although it's not available at launch and the team is "not committing to adding cross-play", once same-system matches are working smoothly, it will take a "second look" and see if cross-play is "feasible". The developer is also looking into ranked matches.</p>

<p>Drop into... Springfield!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Epic's free-to-play battle royale <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has hosted all sorts of exciting collabs over the years, but this latest one, focused on the long-running cartoon series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/simpsons_hit_and_run">The Simpsons</a>, arguably goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>Players will be dropping into an 80-player cel-shaded Springfield Island, featuring a "back-to-basics" style Battle Royale experience. Each week will bring new Simpsons-themed gameplay, shop offerings and much more.</p>
<p>Alongside this will be new "mini episodes", which preview each week's gameplay narrative and map updates. These are original animated shorts, co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic, and released on Disney+ globally and Fortnite's social channels. You can watch the first one below (<strong>warning:</strong> video contains flashing lights).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st November</strong> - <em>“Apocalypse D’Oh"</em></li>
<li><strong>10th November</strong> - <em>“Sugar High”</em></li>
<li><strong>17th November</strong> - <em>“Multiplidiocy”</em></li>
<li><strong>24th November</strong> - <em>“The Incredible Bulk”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to look the part, there'll also be a Springfield Battle Pass, which comes loaded with Outfits as premium rewards including Homer, Marge, Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and a Springfielder version of the Fortnite character Peely. This Battle Pass also has Fortnite's first Sidekick Peels, with <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks">more coming to the Shop</a> next week.</p>
<p>This event follows the release of Fortnite on the Switch 2 in June. You can get the rundown about this version of the game and how it performs in our review here on Nintendo Life:</p>
