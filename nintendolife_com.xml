<p>Very few headlines have sent a shiver down our spines quite like this one, but yes, you read that correctly. Over 20 years after the release of <strong>Kill Bill Vol. 2</strong>, Quentin Tarantino has returned to write and direct one final chapter in the film's chronology... and it's premiering in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>"Quentin Tarantino had a dream of a Kill Bill chapter that never made it to the silver screen, a chapter known as 'Yuki’s Revenge'," the caption to the newly-released teaser trailer above reads. "Over 20 years later, Tarantino and Epic have come together to bring the story to life in Fortnite".</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch the short film, fully animated in the Fortnite engine and starring Uma Thurman (yes, <em>the</em> Uma Thurman), in Fortnite on <strong>30th November</strong> at <strong>7pm GMT / 8pm CET / 2pm, ET / 11am PT</strong>. Alternatively, you can catch it in cinemas during the upcoming screenings of <strong>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</strong> from 5th December.</p>
<p>Those who purchase a ticket to the film's opening weekend will receive a code for Yuki's Gogo Yubari outfit, which can also be unlocked in-game from 27th Nov - 1st Dec.</p>

<p>Fortnite has played host to all kinds of big music events over the years, but the premiere of a new Quentin Tarantino joint (albeit an animated short)? That's <em>wild</em>.</p>
<p>Those who have watched <strong>Kill Bill</strong> will know that it's no family-friendly affair, and while the teaser for the Fortnite short looks like things will be toned down a little (there's only so much peril and gore you can show with an anthropomorphised banana in the background), there's something about the combination of <em>this</em> film and <em>this</em> game that just feels... <em>eeeehh</em>.</p>
<p>Either way, for the Tarantino completionists who want to get in on his latest project early, we'll see you on the Battle Bus. Gosh, what a world we live in.</p>
