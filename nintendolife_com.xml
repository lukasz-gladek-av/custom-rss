<p>You're gonna have a bigger backlog</p>

<figure data-uuid="2e02f1b572090"><a title="Jaws LRG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e02f1b572090/jaws-lrg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Limited Run Games has announced a <em>very exciting</em> enhanced version of 1987's NES "classic", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/jaws">Jaws</a> - and they've got their signature offering of flashy physical editions ready to devour and everything.</p>
<p>These new physical editions of the game come complete with the 8-bit original, now with modern conveniences such as quick save. But, of course, the star turn is a "massively expanded" Jaws Enhanced Edition that embiggens the adventure to incorporate aspects from four (!) of the Jaws movies, rather than just the good one.</p>
<p>With pre-orders opening on 19th December and ending on 18th January 2026 over on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/jaws-retro-edition-bigger-boat-edition-switch-ps5?variant=44839204585525">official Limited Run Games site</a>, the game is set to be released as part of celebrations "culminating in the 50th anniversary of the blockbuster Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg film, and this time there’s no escape." We'll see about that, chief. We'll also update you folks with a solid release date when we have one.</p>

<p>Originally published by LJN back in 1987, you commandeer a boat (don't worry, it's plenty big enough) in order to hunt down a selection of nasty sea-dwelling enemies, including, of course, that great big rubber shark that terrified audiences so badly back in the days when this writer was still rocking a shark-repellent nappy (bet Batman doesn't have one of those).</p>
<p>Here are some more details on both physical versions that will be up for pre-order, alongside some screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jaws Retro Edition Features:<br></strong>Save Anywhere<br>
Rewind<br>
Achievements/Trophies<br>
Music Player<br>
Gallery</p>
<p><strong>Jaws Enhanced Version Features:</strong><br>
Massively expanded, multi-chapter adventure filled with nods and homages to all four Jaws films<br>
New quests and objectives<br>
New abilities and weapons for your boat and diver alike<br>
More challenging enemies, and more ways to deal with them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard version is $34.99, while $99.99 will get you that bigger boat with a "NES-inspired box", a CD (game) soundtrack, a shark lamp, and a couple of other bits.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the original NES game, the excellent Jeremy Parish (who happens to work at Limited Run these days) covered it in his excellent NES Works series several years ago.</p>

<p>Are the upgrades worth it?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption</a> is out now for the Switch 2, delivering an updated version of the acclaimed Wild West romp. We've already provided our own glowing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10 review</a>, but now the lovely chaps at Digital Foundry have gone into even more depth as to what you can expect from a graphical and performance point of view.</p>
<p>Starting off with performance, Red Dead Redemption runs at a mostly stable 60fps, with minor dips present in Armadillo and Blackwater, particularly when playing the <strong>Undead Nightmare</strong> add-on. For the most part, however, you can expect lovely, smooth gameplay with very infrequent interruptions.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the visuals, the game's textures and world design remain pretty much the same as those found on Switch 1. However, while docked, the Switch 2 version utilises DLSS to achieve a much more detailed 1440p resolution from a native 720p. There's much less flickering going on with the foliage, while objects off in the far distance have reduced aliasing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 2D assets such as the in-game map are much more detailed thanks to the higher resolution, while shadows appear slightly more realistic than on the original Switch. There are still a few lingering issues, mind you. Some textures still flicker and pop in slightly, which Digital Foundry notes as "disappointing" given the age of the original game, while shadow quality in handheld mode is noticeably worse when compared to docked.</p>
<p>To be honest, the issues mentioned seem so minor, that it's unlikely to cause any issues for the average player. With a nice boost up to 60fps and much improved resolution thanks to DLSS, it seems Red Dead Redemption on the Switch 2 has proven to be a huge success.</p>

<p>But it'll cost ya</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> is already one of the greatest fighting games of all time, so Capcom really didn't need to do much more to sell it to us. Alas, an upcoming update on <strong>16th December</strong> genuinely sounds like one of the coolest yet, with the game adding a bunch of UI options from previous titles.</p>
<p>So, if you're a fan of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/street_fighter_iii_3rd_strike_fight_for_the_future">Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</a>, you can make the in-game UI closely resemble that of the 1999 entry. Alternatively, you can go back even further and add the UI from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_street_fighter_2_turbo">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</a> from 1994.</p>
<p>Most of the new additions will cost, mind you, with only the Sim Sim design being offered for free for all players. We're not sure exactly how much each option will cost, but it's likely that both Drive Tickets and Fighter Coins can be applied, the latter of which you can purchase with real money.</p>
<p>Here's a look at every new UI option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Super Street Fighter II Turbo<br>
- <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_alpha_3">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a><br>
- Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike<br>
- <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultra_street_fighter_iv">Ultra Street Fighter IV</a><br>
- <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v_champion_edition">Street Fighter V: Champion Edition</a><br>
- Sim Sim (free)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the microtransaction nature of the whole thing, this is a really cool addition for Street Fighter 6. We're particularly keen to utilise the 3rd Strike UI, even if the new iteration isn't <em>exactly</em> the same as the OG.</p>
