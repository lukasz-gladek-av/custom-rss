<figure><a title="Sonic Timberlands" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a1224762b865/sonic-timberlands.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/these-sonic-the-hedgehog-crocs-are-kinda-horrific-and-theyre-out-now">collaborating on a pair of Crocs</a> back in 2023, SEGA is continuing its streak of 'Footwear That Would Be Inappropriate For Sonic The Hedgehog' with a new pair of Sonic-inspired Timberland kicks.</p>
<p>Let's manage those expectations right from the jump. It's unlikely that most of us will ever get our hands on a pair of these bad boys. The collab is in celebration of the upcoming grand opening of SEGA's flagship store in Japan, and will <em>only</em> be available at the nearby Shibuya PARCO Timberland store from 9th August.</p>
<p>Now that we know we're never going to see the range in the flesh, let's collectively cry over how cool it all looks. The highlight item is, of course, a pair of Timbs, which takes the classic "yellow" boot design and throws in some sneaky Sonic nods for good measure. There's a small picture of the blue blur himself etched onto the outer material, the Sonic the Hedgehog icon adorns the inner side, and get a look at those laces!</p>

<p>According to the collaboration announcement on the <a href="https://www.timberland.co.jp/news-250805_sega.html">Japanese Timberland website</a>, the boots will set you back ¥38,500 (roughly £196 / $261) and there are <em>apparently</em> only 30 pairs available. Yep, we're sure people will behave totally normally in the queues for these...</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some other items in the range besides the boots. The collaboration also introduces two long- and short-sleeve t-shirts, available in black or white. Both tops sport the rather snazzy collab icon of Sonic in his Timbs, with the brand logos on the sleeve/chest.</p>

<p>And just to rub it in even more, anyone lucky enough to pick up an item in the range will <em>also</em> land an exclusive postcard and sticker of the boot-wearing hedgehog. Damn, we're suckers for a good sticker...</p>
<p>As we say, it's unlikely that we'll ever see much of the range in person thanks to the ol' Japanese exclusivity, but who knows, perhaps it'll be so popular that it gets a bigger release in the future. We doubt it, but let us dream!</p>
