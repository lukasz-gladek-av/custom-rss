<p>Two watch posts in one day? What is this madness?? With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct in the rear-view mirror, it's time to move on to the <em>second</em> showcase of the day: GamesCom Opening Night Live.</p>
<p>Yes, we are mere minutes away from the grand opening of the huge gaming expo, and <em>the</em> Geoff Keighley is back to guide us through an evening of news and announcements — some of which might even be for Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The event kicks off at <strong>7pm BST / 11am PDT / 2pm EDT / 8pm CEST</strong> and promises roughly <em>two hours</em> of reveals. Those in for the long run can find the full showcase streamed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHo_GVNoKNqfJx6zUGRd6YQ" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, or you can watch along with us via the feed below, so we can all have a natter in the meantime.</p>
<p>All of that is right around the corner, so make sure you're sitting comfortably, because it's almost Geoff o'clock!</p>

<p>Bandai Namco has finally confirmed the next Tales series remaster, and — shocker! — it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a>, and it's coming to Switch 1.</p>
<p>So, we all saw this coming after last week's leak, but here's the surprising bits of news — it's coming out on 31st October 2025, <em>and</em> only Xillia 1 is included, not Xillia 2. Well, the latter was sort of expected, but we hoped the sequel would be bundled too.</p>
<p>Like with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Graces f Remastered</a> earlier in the year, the Switch version of the remaster will also run at 30fps (confirmed on <a href="https://coexist.tales-ch.jp/">the Japanese website</a>) and will be 1080p docked, 720p handheld, making it a bit of a downgrade compared to other releases.</p>
<p>But there are a ton of other features that may make picking this remaster a sweeter deal. Detailed on <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/tales-of-xillia-remastered">the official website</a> (under the What's New section), Tales of Xillia Remastered will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded visuals</li>
<li>Access to the Grade Shop immediately, plus a new item in the shop — "50% off items"</li>
<li>Over 40 original DLC available from the start</li>
<li>Autosave</li>
<li>A new Enemy Encounter toggle, meaning you can entirely avoid combat (except for certain Events)</li>
<li>A Retry feature for regular fights</li>
<li>Subtitles in combat, which you can customise to your liking</li>
<li>A toggle for dashing</li>
<li>Map icons for story destinations, sub-events, and unacquired items and treasure chests</li>
<li>Toggle to automatically skip events</li>
<li>New Artes and items will now be marked</li>
<li>Item descriptions added to the Jet Black Feather Trading Post</li>
<li>Pressing the appropriate button in Option or in the Store will take you to the top of that screen/option from any level</li>
<li>Batch selection available for store development</li>
<li>Can open chests and items even if not facing them - as long as you're next to them, you can open them</li>
<li>You can switch between camera distances on the map to near, normal, or far</li>
<li>Key binding is available on the map and in battle</li>
<li>Additional volume settings, allowing you to adjust the volume of any individual sound aspect</li>
<li>The ability to swap between English and Japanese voices</li>
<li>Typos and errors corrected (in the Japanese version)</li>
<li>Some expressions have been tweaked.</li>
</ul>

<p>So... quite a lot has been tweaked, then! Plus, the biggie is that the game is no longer stuck on PS3. So that's good!</p>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition will include the digital soundtrack, artbook, a Battle BGM Pack and Super Growth Support Herb Set. Pre-ordering early will also get you a handful of in-game items to aid you in your journey, which includes Life Bottles and healing Gels.</p>
<p>Along with the announcement trailer up top, there's also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1nfS6iEx2E&amp;ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica">short video from the Tales series producer, Yusuke Tomizawa</a>.</p>

<p>All we have to go on is a post on social media site X confirming that a video will be dropping at <strong>6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST on Thursday</strong>, a photo of someone holding a gate at night, and a note saying: "Viewer discretion advised".</p>
<p>Yep, that really is it. You can see it below and try and deduce the situation yourselves, but it looks a little spooky. Maybe something Ghost-related?</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2vlyquw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf32irwF2Do" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
