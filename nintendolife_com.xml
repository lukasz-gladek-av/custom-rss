<p>That's a lot of Poké Dollars</p>

<figure data-uuid="80f5633033e3f"><a title="Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80f5633033e3f/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> celebrated its first anniversary last week, and it has seemingly been quite the money maker (thanks, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dethrones-pokemon-go-as-it-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-13bn/">PocketGamer.biz</a>).</p>
<p>According to new estimates from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>, which accounts for in-app spending from Google Play and the App Store, TCG Pocket pulled in almost <strong>$1.3 billion</strong> in its first year alone, making it the highest-grossing debut for a Pokémon mobile app to date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>'s first-year player spending estimates tend to sit around the big 'one billy' mark, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Masters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a> are drops in the ocean, comparatively.</p>
<p>Of course, this shouldn't really come as a big surprise. TCG Pocket racked up over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-surpassed-10-million-downloads-in-its-first-48-hours">10 million downloads in its first 48 hours</a> on the market, and it was quickly reported that the app was pulling in around <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-reportedly-already-bringing-in-the-big-bucks">$3 million per day</a> as it got off the start line.</p>
<p>That appetite will have obviously slowed down a little in the months since, but it looks like the consistent cadence of new expansions and feature updates has kept the Poké Dollars rolling in. Hey, they do say that you've got catch 'em all...</p>
<p>To mark its one-year anniversary, The Pokémon Company released a special video, revealing that TCG Pocket players have opened over 18 billion packs, competed in 12+ billion battles, made 96 million trades and much more besides. You'll find it in full below:</p>

<p>Out on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">Dragon Quest I</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_ii">Dragon Quest II</a> are much-expanded compared to their original releases. There's tons of new story content, optional dungeons, quests, Mini Medals, skills, spells... the list goes on. Essentially, this is a transformative remake of two iconic classic RPGs.</p><div><figure data-videoid="GReZx3uoZNA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytGReZx3uoZNA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed640b4evuxtrw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>And we absolutely loved it: We scored the Nintendo Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">a glowing 9/10</a>, concluding that "Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is a deeply satisfying follow-up to last year’s remake project, closing out the Erdrick trilogy on a fittingly high note."</p>

<p>We know this series has a long line of fans who love playing these games on Nintendo consoles, and a lot of RPG fans have been pouring hours into both games this weekend. So we want to know what you think of Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, whether you're playing on Switch 1 or Switch 2.</p>
<p>As always, share your review score in the poll below (we've got separate ones for the Switch 1 and 2 releases), or swing by later when you've had a chance to play a bit more. Or, if you want, you can even leave one score now and then tweak it later on if you change your mind after a few more hours with it. These are <em>long</em> games!</p>
