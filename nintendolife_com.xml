</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo launched the Switch 2 earlier this year in June, it also released multiple free game updates for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these updates was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> - adding visual optimisations, Joy-Con 2 mouse support and more. Now in a follow up update, it's rolled out Version 1.1.1. This particular update tackles some issues when playing this title on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 1.1.1 (Released August 5, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with system functionality when playing using a Nintendo Switch 2 console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: An update addressing the issue above is now available for <em>Game Builder Garage: Demo Version</em> as well (Ver. 1.1.1).</p>
<hr>
<p>In the previous update, Nintendo also released a patch for the demo version of Game Builder Garage.</p>

<p>Defeat Eggman, again</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> has announced a new update for its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> collaboration DLC, and it's out today.</p>
<p>The 'Super Update' is a new add-on where you'll need to gather the Chaos Emeralds, defeat Dr. Eggman and transform into Super Sonic and Super Shadow.</p>

<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog DLC for Minecraft has previously added iconic zones, awesome characters, thrilling abilities, and various familiar-looking enemies.</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering, Minecraft hasn't received an upgrade or anything similar for the Switch 2 (at least yet), but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>In some other Sonic news, it was recently revealed the blue blur will be <a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/sonic-racing-cross-worlds-announces-beyblade-x-collaboration/">teaming up with Beyblades</a> in his new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. Additionally, he's getting a new set of kicks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/timberland-is-teaming-up-with-sonic-on-a-new-range-of-boots-and-clothing">thanks to a new collaboration with Timberland</a>.</p>

<p>This comes from PM Studios, the physical game publisher who is handling Yooka-Replaylee's release. The company shared a video on Bluesky giving us a very short explanation on what to expect.</p>
<p>The video confirms that the game is "content complete" and Playtonic are currently in the playtesting phase, looking for bugs to iron out.</p>

<p>We don't know when that "soon" is, of course. It could be the Indie World showcase on Thursday, but it also could be at gamescom Opening Night Live, which is on 19th August.</p>
<p>Basically, there are many places we could find out, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>It's Fortnite-ing time</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At last, the Power Rangers are making their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> debut later this week on 7th August.</p>
<p>There's been rumours about the Rangers dropping in the free-to-play battle royale for a while, and today's trailer confirms when <em>and</em> what to expect. They'll be landing in-game during Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock 'N Awesome. Oh, and did we mention that the trailer is incredible?</p>
<p>Featuring a blend of CGI and live action, we get an introduction to the Bad Bugs which Fortnite characters are battling in CGI. Then, the Red, Blue, and Yellow Rangers arrive and we get a cut to live action and a change in aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Butt rock music, over-the-top explosions and action, and martial arts-style stunts all accompanied by Peely; it's a little surreal to see the '90s era of Power Rangers alongside iconic Fortnite characters. But goodness, is this trailer great, especially if you grew up watching the show.</p>
<p>Later in the month, the Mighty Morphin Bundle will be hitting the in-game store, where you'll be able to unlock Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger, and Blue Ranger outfits and iconic accessories.</p>
<figure><a title="Power Rangers Fortnite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe5333a75949e/power-rangers-fortnite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're a Battle Pass holder, you'' also have access to a series of quests which kick off on 16th September; completing these will unlock the Dino Megazord outfit. Megazord will also be arriving mid-season for a takeover.</p>
<p>So it sounds like this is a no-brainer for Power Rangers fans, then. That trailer <em>might</em> have some of us downloading the game on Switch 2 right now; that version is pretty good, too!</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Power Rangers in Fortnite in the comments</em>.</p>
