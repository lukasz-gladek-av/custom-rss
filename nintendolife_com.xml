<figure><a title="EA CEO PAY INCREASE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc250c7342108/ea-ceo-pay-increase.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>EA's CEO, Andrew Wilson, has somehow managed to find himself $5 million richer than usual this year, according to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000130817925000556/ea014143-def14a.htm">latest Proxy filing by the company</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">Stephen Totilo over at Game File</a>, the extra cash on top of an already very nice annual income, flies directly in the face of how the general population of workers for the company are being renumerated. This is all bad, however it has made for a rather amusingly shaped graph, so silver linings and all that.</p>

<p>Indeed, and ignoring the huge graph for just a second, EA reported the median income for full-time employees in the company circa 2024 was $117,000, down from $149,000 in 2023. That's...that's a massive drop. Now Totilo goes into some really depressing details here, in that EA's reported figures, according to Game File, are notoriously imprecise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s ostensibly based on a median average, not the mean (median = pulling the middle number from a stack of salaries; mean = adding the salary stack together, then dividing by the number of salaries in that stack).<br>
Confusingly, EA says it used “the same median employee” in 2025 that it used to compare compensation with Wilson in 2023 and 2024.<br>
It does not explain that workers’ 2025 pay drop, but says its figures for CEO and worker pay both include bonuses and stock grants, which can rise and fall in a given year."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you catch all that, the main thing to note, as ever, is that Joe Public gets less, while the CEO makes an extra stash that's more than most of us will see in our entire lives. As you were, comrades.</p>
<p>Now onto the graphs, and we'll let you <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">click through</a> to the very tall one but let's just say it really highlights, by having you scroll a few seconds longer than you may think you're gonna, all the way up from $100k right to that big fat £39 million dollar pay stack of Wilson's, just how huge the gap is between top and bottom...and with seemingly very little explanation.</p>

<figure><a title="teamgroup memory cards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b91240dae428/teamgroup-memory-cards.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: TeamGroup</em></figcaption></figure><p>TeamGroup, a UK-based memory brand, has just announced a new line of those ever-elusive MicroSD Express cards that we've all been trying to find the largest sizes of...with very little success.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/amp/">WCCFTech</a>, the company has detailed its Apex SD7.1 range, which includes storage sizes from 128gb right up to 1TB. From the press release, here's some further info. Oh, and we do like the little controller design on these, we must say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Next-Gen MicroSD Express Technology – Comprehensive Performance Upgrade</em></li>
<li><em>Fully Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2<sup>[4]</sup> with Broad Device Compatibility</em></li>
<li><em>Ultra-Fast Read/Write Speeds up to 800MB/s &amp; 700MB/s</em></li>
<li><em>Certified by SD Association’s SVP Program</em></li>
<li><em>Evolved High Capacity Storage Space of up to 1TB</em></li>
<li><em>Seamless 4K Recording to Capture Every Moment</em></li>
<li><em>Comprehensive Protection with Lifetime Warranty</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a bunch of details about how these cards are "resistant to water, shock, X-rays, static electricity, and extreme temperatures, enabling stable performance even in harsh environments." So, a standard Saturday night out in Glasgow with your Switch 2 should be fine, then.</p>
<p>Sounds great! Now, how much are they and where can we get all the biggest ones before they sell out? Well, for now, we have no details on pricing, but you can head over to the TeamGroup's website, where they detail <a href="https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/shop/united-kingdom/">stores that should stock the cards once they release</a>. We've had a quick look and we can see that Overclockers is one supplier for UK-based gamers, whilst in the US you have Amazon and Newegg amongst your choices.</p>
<p>We'll keep you updated as soon as we've got further details on release dates and that all-important pricing! Oh, and while you're here, why not dive into our guide to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2">best MicroSD Express cards on Switch 2</a>!</p>
