<p>Plus a new 'PURE' performance mode</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Fast Fusion - PURE Update 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4d6772b28bbdb/fast-fusion-pure-update-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Shin'en Multimedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shin'en Multimedia has been hard at work on the first major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> on the Switch 2, and we can now exclusively reveal that it will launch this week on <strong>26th June 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>But what do you get with it? Well, Shin'en has confirmed to us that the 'Pure Update' – which is completely free, by the way – will contain three new tracks based on classics from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These will be largely faithful recreations of fan favourites from the original 2017 Switch launch title, but with small tweaks to make use of the new 'Hyperjump' feature along with all new visuals and effects.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b9621kyhwjl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Carbium Cup</h2>
<p>- Alpine Trust<br>
- Sunahara Plains<br>
- Zenshoh Habitat</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the new tracks, the Pure Update will also include a new performance mode simply called 'Pure', which renders at 1440p dynamic resolution with no upscaling applied. Fan feedback from the game's release was that the visuals could often look a little blurry due to the application of DLSS, so hopefully this new option will completely erradicate this.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Shin'en has also shared that the Alpine Trust track will implement a new GPU particle system for the snowflakes effect, and we honestly can't wait to see this in action. We're also getting two new Jukebox entries, tweaks to make progression slightly easier (specifically a lower price for the third cup), a bug fix to resolve a rare crash when switching rendering modes often, and several smaller fixes and corrections.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the new tracks:</p>


<p>Fast Fusion is a real showstopper launch title for the Switch 2, earning a well-deserved score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">9/10 in our review</a>. We said that it's "easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far" and is "an absolute must-buy" for new Switch 2 owners.</p>
<p>If, however, you thought the overall content was a little slim, then hopefully this first major update will help alleviate this with the addition of three new tracks.</p>

<p>"About 3 times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="slow lcd df switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fbd80acc0dfd/slow-lcd-df-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">reported a few days back</a> that the boffins over at Digital Foundry were less than impressed with the Switch 2's LCD screen after running various tests on it.</p>
<p>Now, however, DF's John Linneman has <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1937199770788901151">weighed in on social media</a> to confirm that the new screen is more "problematic" than had first appeared—and then some.</p>
<p>On his social media, Linneman pointed to tests run on the Switch 2 LCD on a specialist PC Monitor site, <a href="https://chimolog.co/">Chimilog</a>:</p>

<p>As you can see, the Switch 2's screen is at the bottom of the list of LCDs when put through a gauntlet of technical tests to measure its performance. The image in his post, on the left, shows average response times of 32 LCDs, and the Switch 2 lands with the worst time here.</p>
<p>Linneman also compares the performance to being "about three times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD" and states once again, as we'd covered in our previous article, that it's actually <em>worse</em> in some ways than the 2017 Switch LCD.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, we (or this writer at the very least) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">have been very happy with our screens thus far</a>, and judging by the general reception to it, most gamers perhaps don't need to sweat this stuff.</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame that the screen just doesn't seem to be up to the standard it perhaps could, and should, have been as part of a brand new console circa 2025. There's always the Switch 2 OLED Model though, right?</p>

<figure><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7f90c57e69c2/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nightdive Studios has announced that it has delayed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> on the Switch, with the game now targeting a console release within "the first two weeks of July".</p>
<p>In a statement released on social media, the remaster wizards stated that the team simply "encountered issues" that prevented it from releasing the game on its originally intended launch date of 26th June. If you happen to be playing on PC, get your chisel out, because this date is still locked in – it's just the console release that's affected.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mkuqps&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It doesn't sound like we'll be waiting <em>too</em> long for the game, however, though it's important to keep in mind that the current July estimate is exactly that – an estimate – and is just as prone to a further delay should the team deem it necessary.</p>
<p>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is an enhanced release of the original 1999 classic from co-developers Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. It was one of the first projects from creator Ken Levine and is considered a spiritual precursor to the <strong>Bioshock</strong> series.</p>
<p>A full-blown <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">remake of the original System Shock</a> was released on PC and consoles, but skipped the Switch when it cropped up in 2024. We wouldn't be surprised, however, to see it ported over to the Switch 2 in the near future to take full advantage of the console's extra power.</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds removes "unfair" and "stressful" items</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Seen as a means of keeping the playing field (relatively) level, this item targets the player in first place, and has been the cause of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/mario_kart_8_deluxe_world_record_attempt_fittingly_destroyed_by_blue_shell">much frustration over the decades</a>—to the point where some people argue it's actually a <em>disadvantage</em> to be in first position for much of each Mario Kart race.</p>
<p>It would seem that Sega has been aware of this issue when designing its Mario Kart rival <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which is coming to Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S later this year.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog/veteran-sonic-producer-says-sonic-racing-crossworlds-team-completely-removed-items-from-the-game-if-they-were-too-stressful-or-let-players-win-all-the-time/">GamesRadar+</a>, Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka reveals that when developing the game, there was a focus on making the racing "balanced" and "fair", even going as far as to design the circuits <em>before</em> thinking about adding items to the mix.</p>
<p>"They wanted to make sure the racing itself without any items was fair and fun," says Iizuka. "The dev team really took things down to the base level, and wanted to have that fun, competitive racing mechanic."</p>

<p>Even when items were in place, Iizuka explains that a multitude of playtests took place in order to ensure that the experience remained fair. "Anything that was very stressful for players, anything that always allowed people to come back from behind and win all the time needed to be removed from the concept," he says, throwing some subtle shade on Mario Kart's most feared item.</p>
<p>If you're worried that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is sounding too sterile and safe, don't be—Iizuka admits that the development team eventually hit a balance which was just "the right amount of chaotic" while remaining "fair to the racers."</p>
<p>We'll see if this balance is successful when the game launches on September 25th. The Switch 2 version is expected at a later date.</p>

<p>MVG says it's "decent" but needs improvement</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="GameCube Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46e951e621e03/gamecube-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's online service has made GameCube games available for the Switch 2 and if you're wondering whether it's worth paying the extra money to experience these retro titles but aren't so sure after Nintendo's history with emulation of <em>other</em> legacy systems, this video might be worth a look.</p>
<p>Game developer and YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/A3ylCAr0dbs">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>, who has an extensive history in the field of video game emulation, has taken a look at the Switch Online's latest "classic" library and while he finds the experience to be "decent" enough, he can't help but feel there are some underlying issues "Nintendo desperately needs to fix" – drawing a comparison to Switch Online's emulation of Nintendo 64 games, and how the Japanese firm eventually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/nintendo-appears-to-have-improved-switch-onlines-n64-emulation">got on top of these problems</a>.</p>
<p>While the initial first impressions of the GameCube library are "very good", there are apparently some "obvious" differences to the real experience – with the video below highlighting input lag issues, analog sensitivity and calibration, and online performance and networking also causing some problems. Of course, these aren't necessarily going to be a big deal to anyone who is simply seeking a quick nostalgic fix, but if you're a retro purist it may not live up to expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>MVG:</strong> "If you're a casual player you may not even realise some of these issues...but if you're a hardcore F-Zero gamer, you may be feeling a little more frustrated with how the game plays."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get the full rundown in MVG's video below and check out more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer">Switch 2 videos on his YouTube channel</a> (he's worked on projects like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/video_mvg_explains_how_the_original_shantae_game_was_ported_to_switch">Shantae port for Switch</a> as well). The tech experts at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry</a> have also shared an analysis of Nintendo's new hybrid system calling it a "satisfying upgrade" despite some "problematic" display issues.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdfc4f3f7d5ae/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many libraries offer services where you can experience and even borrow video games. Unfortunately, a 45-year-old Oakland man named Jamal Reed-Obafumi has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from Marin County Libraries, located in Northern California.</p>
<p>Marin County's Sheriff's Detectives arrested Reed-Obafumi last week after he was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". This took place between April and June 2025 across multiple branches.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mkuqps&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The Sheriff's Office further notes how he has been "booked" into the Marin County Jail and is currently facing 12 felony charges, including multiple counts of burglary and committing a felony while out on bail. It's further noted how libraries "must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy" as they are a pillar of the community.</p>
<p>According to GameSpot, the Marin County Library <a href="https://marinlibrary.bibliocommons.com/v2/search?query=Switch&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;f_FORMAT=VIDEO_GAME">reportedly has a catalog of over "200 Switch games available to borrow"</a>. It's not mentioned if any of the games have been recovered. This follows a story last week about more than 2,800 Switch 2 consoles being stolen from a semi-truck in Texas. You can find out more about this in our previous story.</p>
