<figure><a title="Review: Genki Dual Wield Joy-Con Charging Dock For Switch 2 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b2b8b2977436/review-genki-dual-wield-joy-con-charging-dock-for-switch-2-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Genki — which recently made headlines by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-and-accessory-maker-genki-reach-settlement-in-switch-2-lawsuit">settling a lawsuit with Nintendo</a> after it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">showcased 3D-printed mockups of the Switch 2 during CES 2025</a> — has supported the arrival of the new hybrid console with a selection of accessories and cases. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/joy-station">Dual Wield ($39.99)</a> follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo">Force Field 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Sleeper Case</a>, and offers a means of charging four Joy-Con 2 controllers at once.</p>
<p>This isn't a new or groundbreaking concept, of course; we saw similar controller charging docks during the original Switch's lifespan. These products certainly have their uses, especially if you have one Switch 2 console but multiple Joy-Con for local multiplayer sessions, but is this worth the $40 asking price?</p>

<p>The Dual Wield certainly ticks all of the boxes when it comes to basic functionality. It consists of the charging dock (which is powered by a USB-A to USB-C cable, included in the bundle) and a pair of 'Delta' Joy-Con controller grips. These can charge your Joy-Con in two ways: there's a USB-C port on the top and a charging port on the bottom, which magnetically interfaces with the dock.</p>
<p>When charging on the dock, you'll see a pair of red LEDs light up for each Joy-Con – these turn to green once each Joy-Con is at full capacity. To eject the Delta grip, you press the button in front.</p>
<p>So far, so good, right? Sadly, the Delta grips themselves leave a little to be desired. It's not that they're uncomfortable to use – in fact, I'd go as far as to say they offer decent ergonomics when it comes to long play sessions. The bigger issue is that there's a lot of 'flex' on each Joy-Con, and it's actually possible to pull them off the grip without too much effort.</p>

<p>While a good, hard yank will also dislodge the Joy-Con from the official grip, it's much easier with Genki's offering. Nintendo's grips also avoid the 'flex' issue by including built-in prongs, which are what your hands grip during play. With the Genki Delta grip, you're mostly holding onto the Joy-Con themselves rather than the grip, hence the worrying amount of movement.</p>
<p>I also don't like how hard it is to see the Joy-Con's LED lights through the dark, transparent casing of the Delta grip. The light is dim, and it's sometimes hard to make out if the Joy-Con are switched on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Genki Dual Wield isn't a total miss; the Delta grips are comfortable to use, and the dock itself looks attractive enough to integrate into most AV setups. My biggest gripe is how unstable the Joy-Con feel when they're attached to that Delta; Nintendo's official grip is far superior.</p>

<p>And an old foe returns in a timed in-game event</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="DxM gyro and live event" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4892c75f309f/dxm-gyro-and-live-event.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Marvellous</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> has been out in the wild for around about a week now and, if you checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">our 6/10 review</a> of the game, you'll know that gyro controls were missing from action at launch. Boo!</p>
<p>Now, producer Kenichiro Tsukuda, <a href="https://x.com/dxm_game/status/1965228970770596351">via the game's official social media account</a>, has dropped some details on an upcoming patch that will sort our gyro woes, alongside a bunch of other fixes. Here's the post, plus the accompanying text detailing the upcoming patch notes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Planned Bug Fixes<br>
- Fix Rebellion’s behavior in the Teos Omos Desert.<br>
- Fix a bug where a violation of the End User License Agreement was incorrectly displayed when a network error occurred.<br>
- Fix for character models failing to load during event scenes.<br>
- Fix for Supply Bases becoming inaccessible.<br>
- Fix a bug where battle music fails to stop playing.<br>
- Fix other minor bugs.</p>
<p>Planned Additions and Adjustments<br>
- Added option to enable gyro controls for Nintendo Switch™ 2 and PlayStation®5.<br>
- Added options to adjust strength of camera acceleration and inertia.<br>
- Changed camera sensitivity settings to be separately adjustable for vertical and horizontal axes.<br>
- Changed early-game quest “The Bout With Ash” to allow players to pick up weapons inside the arena.<br>
- Improved loading times during online play.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no date on when exactly this patch will drop, but we're excited to see gyro-aiming get sorted so quickly. The other standouts are reduced loading times and camera improvements, which could make for a less stodgy feel to proceedings as we all keep our big metal fingers crossed for more meaningful performance gains and upgrades down the road.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, while awaiting the patch, you can also brush up on your mech-fighting skills against an old foe, as one of the original game's toughest boss battles has returned as a timed event that's running from right now until September 15th.</p>
<p>Yep, if you're a long-time fan, you'll need no introduction to Zeruchroar, who is back and looking for a scrap (cheers for the heads-up, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/09/11/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-brings-back-old-boss-for-a-new-event/">Forbes</a>). Now this was quite a nasty battle back on the first game, so luckily, if you are intending to try it, know that there is at least a reward in the form of some new blueprints and a "glitched fusion upgrade" should you best the rotten beast. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Oh, and just head to your base in-game to get an alert to start the timed event.</p>

<figure><a title="Silksong Bench" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/575bc404b24ad/silksong-bench.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a pretty tough game; we know this, and we've <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">discussed it at length already</a>. But there's one section of the game that is proving to be particularly devious.</p>
<p>Before we go ahead, please note that although this article won't cover anything related to Silksong's story, we will be <strong>spoiling a key gameplay surprise</strong> that you might want to discover for yourself. If you'd like to maintain the mystery, consider coming back at a later date.</p>
<p>So essentially, as covered by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-traumatized-hunters-march-bench-trap/">The Gamer</a>, a single bench located in Hunter's March – one of the most demanding areas of the game, no less – doesn't offer the usual respite that you might expect. Instead, sitting on it (and keep in mind the usual 'Rest' prompt will still pop up) will actually trigger a deadly trap, causing spikes to swing down from the right and, should be low on health, kill you.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tvsoul&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Such_Food4915/">Such_Food4915</a> highlighted this with a simple caption that states "i have no words. this is the most anger i have ever felt for any game ever. i had one mask".</p>

<p>Similarly, X user <a href="https://x.com/DazrTheKing">Dazr</a> has posted a video showcasing exactly what the bench in question will do should you sit in it. <strong>Last warning if you're still here</strong>, this will show you everything:</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind for us when looking at this is that it's remarkably similar to how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> played a mean trick on gamers with the Mimic enemy. These things disguise themselves as chests which, when opening, triggers a pretty devastating attack.</p>
<p>It's a pretty clever – albeit naughty – way to lull players into a false sense of security, and it shifts your mindset going forwards. Nothing is truly safe within the world of Silksong, and you'd best keep your wits about you at all times.</p>
