<p>Following Three Kingdoms</p>

<figure data-uuid="474863209768b"><a title="Kunio kun" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/474863209768b/kunio-kun.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Arc System Works</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>To kick off the new year, Arc System Works has announced it will be releasing a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/river_city_saga_three_kingdoms">River City Saga</a> game.</p>
<p>It's currently being referred to as <strong>River City Saga: Journey to the West</strong>, but the official English title hasn't been revealed just yet. It will be coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms at some point in 2026 and according to a rough translation is described as an "absurd and thrilling comedy action game".</p>
<p>Here's the rest of the PR description (via Gematsu), and above is the first official artwork for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, Sanzang!? All of the main cast are <em>Kunio</em>-style characters! This is an absurd and thrilling comedy action game where everyone sets out to reach India! Following <em>River City Saga: Three Kingdoms</em>, <em>River City Saga: Journey to the West</em> is a new title themed after the Chinese myth <em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>
<p>"In the turbulent era of the Tang dynasty, monsters run rampant, and there is no hope for salvation. Saddened by the state of the world, Sakyamuni seeks to save it through the teachings of Buddha. And so he establishes the “Journey to Obtain the Scriptures,” sending them on a journey to the far western land of India to retrieve the Buddhist scriptures. The skilled Sun Wukong becomes a disciple of Sanzang and, in order to atone for his past sins, sets out on the journey to obtain the scriptures while protecting his master. The cheerful and easily carried-away Zhu Bajie and the earnest monk Sha Wujing also join as disciples, and the Sanzang party continues its journey west once again. The road to India stretches 108,000 miles. What kind of journey awaits them now…?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title is currently playable at the Taipei Game Show, and although gameplay hasn't been officially shared just yet, you can catch an incredibly brief glimpse via <a href="https://youtu.be/V8vonn3ShWc?t=611">a YouTube upload</a>.</p>

<p>It was officially dissolved earlier this month</p>

<figure data-uuid="1421921698a16"><a title="Mighty No. 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1421921698a16/mighty-no-9.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>The video game company Comcept, originally founded by Keiji Inafune in December 2010, has been "officially dissolved by a shareholders' resolution" earlier this month on 13th January 2026.</p>
<p>A notice was published about this today in Japan's government gazette Kanpo (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/comcept-shuts-down">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>If you're a tad confused based on previous reports and updates, Gematsu's creator and editor Sal Romano has provided a bit more context about what exactly has taken place here (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/comcept-shuts-down.1419268/page-2#post-150647608">via ResetEra</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LEVEL-5 never actually acquired Comcept. Early reports of the LEVEL5 comcept establishment came from Japanese blogs reporting on it from Weekly Famitsu, and mentioned comcept becoming a subsidiary of LEVEL-5, but this was actually a misunderstanding.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132lotnqm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>The official announcement later posted here --- <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/</a> --- only mentions that a new company called LEVEL5 comcept was established, and that it is a fully owned subsidiary of LEVEL-5. It still refers to Inafune is comcept's CEO, as well as a co-CEO of LEVEL5 comcept with Akihiro Hino. It even mentions that titles currently in development by comcept at the time would continue to be managed by comcept (and not LEVEL5 comcept).</p>
<p>It's mentioned in the article, but LEVEL5 comcept was already dissolved and taken over by the newer LEVEL-5 Osaka Office following Inafune's departure from LEVEL-5 in mid-2024. This is the studio that made FANTASY LIFE i.</p>
<p>However, comcept as a separate company still existed. Until now that is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comcept made headlines over the years for its troubled release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mighty_no_9">Mighty No. 9</a>, which originally started life as a Kickstarter project. Before founding his studio and his eventual "departure from Level-5 in mid-2024", Inafune worked at Capcom on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamegear/mega_man">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha</a> and multiple other well-known video game series.</p>
<p>Apart from Mighty No. 9, the studio helped out with games such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/soul_sacrifice">Soul Sacrifice</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/recore">ReCore</a>. As for Level-5's Osaka office, it most recently worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>.</p>

<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> speeds onto the Switch 2 this week, and it just might be the best-looking game to date on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/grid-legends-on-switch-2-an-excellent-racer-stacked-with-graphics-options">Digital Foundry has now taken a look</a>, and here's exactly what you can expect when it comes to the game's performance and resolution across the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The docked graphics mode runs between 1080p and 1440p at 30fps, and docked performance mode is 792p to 1080p and maintains a smooth 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the handheld experience, GRID Legends has four options on the Switch 2. This includes performance, battery saver, balanced and graphics modes. In graphics mode, the game runs between 792p and 1080p at 30fps, and in performance it's 684p to 828p at 60fps. The battery saver and balanced modes result in lower resolution and frame rates of 30fps and 40fps.</p>
<p>So, what's the best way to play? Here's Digital Foundry's recommendations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the docked experience, we're going to have to give the nod to the 30fps graphics mode simply because so much of the visual experience is stripped back to give you that 60fps alternative that the game loses a lot of its graphical appeal - and we have to wonder why the option for a 40fps balanced mode that traded some resolution for features didn't make its way into the shipping game. For mobile gaming, it's perhaps no surprise that we've opted for that 40fps alternative: resolution is OK, a 25ms per-frame refresh still looks good on the VRR panel and while you don't get volumetric lights, the return of screen-space reflections is worth it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, PJ O'Reilly recommended the "smooth performance" option and was still blown away by how great it looked on the big screen. He was also impressed with the range of graphics options and just how "solid" they were across both the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>If you want to find out even more details about the Switch 2 version's graphics, performance, added extras and how it compares to other platforms, check out Digital Foundry's video review above and its website for a more comprehensive breakdown.</p>

<p>We weren't expecting this!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo released a major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> this week, and in case you missed it, it adds health bars to the game.</p>
<p>This has come as a real surprise to Splatoon players, as up until now, the enemy's health in multiplayer was displayed through visual cues. As Nintendo notes, the remaining health of opponents will now be shown above their heads for "a few seconds" when they're visible. Certain abilities can also make this bar visible.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description about the implementation of health bars in multiplayer:</p>
<h2>Health bar</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With version 11.0.0, it’s now possible to see an opponent’s remaining health when they’ve been hit. Previously, you could only see how damaged an enemy was by looking closely at how much ink they were covered in – not so easy to do in the heat of battle!</p>
<p>"Now, their remaining health will be shown in a bar above their head for a few seconds, provided they’ve not ducked behind cover or dived into their ink. Though if the opponent is visible via abilities such as Thermal Ink or has been marked by things like a Point Sensor or Wave Breaker you’ll be able to see it even then!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned by Nintendo, it's not always the easiest to see "how damaged an enemy" is in the heat of the battle, so this update will no doubt help, even if it arguably removes some of the uniqueness and charm of the team-based squid-shooter.</p>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how you can now also see the health bars of your teammates when they've taken damage, which may allow you to save them before they're wiped out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll also be able to see the health bars of your teammates if they’ve taken damage. Keeping an eye on these health bars is a great way to support your allies or chase down weakened foes – even if you’ve teamed up with Inklings and Octolings you’re not familiar with."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from these updates, Nintendo has also highlighted some other notable updates, including a new state known as "Flow Aura", updates to the game's hit detection, and stealth jump. You can find out more about all of this in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-ver-11-0-0-update-launches-this-week-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">official patch notes</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> arrives on the Switch 2 next month and apart from a pro controller, watches, bags and amiibo, there'll also a themed microSD Express Card.</p>
<p>This <strong>512GB</strong> card comes Powin features the Umbrella Corporation logo on it. Apart from this, it works the same as any other card, and allows you to save all of your Switch 2 data on it.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live on sites such as Playasia, with the card priced at <strong>$139.99 USD</strong> (or your regional equivalent) and expected to ship on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> - the same date as the launch of the title.</p>

Of course, this is subject to change before the release, and there could also be updates in the future which change the game's file size.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the physical version of this release of Resident Evil Requiem has also been confirmed as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card release</a>, so either way, you'll need to make sure you've got plenty of space on your Switch 2 to install this game.</p>
