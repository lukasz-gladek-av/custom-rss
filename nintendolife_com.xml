<p>Cats, monsters, and... James Sunderland?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bloober Team has unveiled its latest trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> on Switch, and it's probably the best one yet.</p>
<p>Starting from the perspective of a cat, of all things, it quickly descends into chaos, with monsters roaming about, weird telekinetic abilities, and even some nifty anti-grav sections.</p>
<p>In what we're certain is just an amusing coincidence, there's also a very short clip at about 1:41 in which we see a character that looks remarkably similar to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a>'s protagonist, James Sunderland. Notably, Bloober Team created the recent remake exclusively for PS5, which launched to critical acclaim. The dude in the trailer is looking a bit worse for wear though, so whatever's happened to him can't be good.</p>
<p>It's looking promising, regardless, and we're excited to see more. Cronos: The New Dawn will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
