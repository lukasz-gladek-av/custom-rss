<p>Well, in case you missed it, this release for Pokémon's 30th anniversary, which is taking place next week on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, is a special occasion. In other words, it doesn't necessarily guarantee more standalone purchases from this era (or from other generations of "classic" Nintendo hardware) going forward, as there are seemingly no plans for "Virtual Console types of offerings".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkrijpt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Although it's not an outright "no", according to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">official FAQ for the upcoming Pokémon releases</a>, the company insists it remains focused on offering its classic titles through the paid Switch Online + Expansion service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>What about other classic games beyond Pokémon titles? Is this the return of standalone Virtual Console types of offerings?</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Nintendo:</strong> "</em><em>We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason behind these particular classic game releases being handled "differently" is because the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">apparently thought it would be "fun"</a> to celebrate 30 years of Pokémon like this. To join in on the fun, you'll be required to pay <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> for each title.</p>
<p>Even if Nintendo's comment here was to rule out the return of "Virtual Console types of offerings", other companies such as Hamster Corporation has recently upped retro support with the announcement of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-is-the-closest-well-get-to-virtual-console-in-2026">Console Archives collection</a>. This new library from Hamster revives select titles from multiple console generations, and some titles are already available on the eShop.</p>
<p>Nintendo's most recent update to the Switch Online service is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/virtual-boy-for-switch-1-and-2-is-it-really-worth-revisting-nintendos-greatest-folly">launch of the Virtual Boy library</a> earlier this week. To access this particular library of games, you'll need to have an active Expansion Pack membership and one of the new accessories (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/can-you-use-labo-vr-goggles-for-virtual-boy-games-on-switch-and-other-nintendo-classics-vb-questions-answered">or try one of the workarounds</a>).</p>

<p>Releasing on Switch next week!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>A week out from Pokémon Day and Pokémon's official 30th anniversary celebrations, Nintendo has officially announced the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> as standalone eShop releases.</p>
<p>The announcement has surprised (and shocked) trainers around the globe in all sorts of ways and if the existing info dump wasn't already enough, the official Pokémon YouTube channel is now sharing additional footage of the returning Game Boy Advance titles.</p>
<p>In this particular video, we're given a side-by-side of the FireRed and LeafGreen opening themes, and how exactly you can expect them to look if you end up purchasing them for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each (or your regional equivalent) on the Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The excitement of the Kanto region, as well as the charming Pokémon you know and love, are just as you remember them with updated graphics in Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version. The Sevii Islands—not present in Pokémon Red or Pokémon Blue—have also been added, greatly expanding the areas you can explore and the scope of your adventure. We hope you enjoy these classic Pokémon adventures on Nintendo Switch too!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These games are returning on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> and Nintendo has even released an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">extensive FAQ</a>, clarifying all sorts of details about the Switch releases. This also rules out a local physical release, although there will be one made available in Japan, but it's a code-in-box release.</p>

<p>We're fast approaching the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> on the Switch 2, and ahead of what might just be one of the most-anticipated games of 2026, Capcom has issued a special notice to the "Resident Evil community" about spoilers and leaks.</p>
<p>In a message on social media, it asks fans to "please" not "post or share any pre-release leaks and spoilers" of the new entry starring the series' icon Leon S. Kennedy and the FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<p>Capcom has also mentioned in the same notice how its legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices if required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Capcom:</strong> "We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible. Our legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are planning on jumping into this new Resident Evil experience on release, and don't want any spoilers, at least you know now to tread carefully over the coming days. Leaks tied to Requiem's story (and more) are already supposedly circulating on social media, subreddits and elsewhere online.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches for the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, and there'll be two amiibo released later this year.</p>

<p>10,000,000.0000000 (and counting)</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> continues to be a big sales success for Square Enix, and in a celebratory video for the game's 9th anniversary, we now know the game — a sequel to 2010's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/nier">NieR</a> — has sold over 10 million units. Plus we have a tease for the series' future</p>
<p>Last we heard, the 2017 action RPG, which came to Switch in 2022 via an excellent port, had sold 9 million units <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/nierautomata-surpasses-another-sales-milestone-plans-for-2025-teased">back in December 2024</a>. Another million copies sold in just over a year for a near-decade-old game isn't bad at all.</p>
<p>But the big news is the teaser at the end of the trailer. As the screen fades to black, text appears to be typed onto the screen: NieR:Automata to be continued...</p>
<p>So, what does this mean? Are we getting a direct sequel? A brand new NieR game? A port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/nier_replicant_ver_1_22474487139">NieR Replicant</a>, the remake of the original NieR, from 2021?</p>
<figure data-uuid="efcf5c8c1ac8a"><a title="NieR:Automata to be continued..." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/efcf5c8c1ac8a/nierautomata-to-be-continued.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, if you're a long-time fan, though you might be inclined to get excited, you also know this could mean literally anything <em>but</em> a new game. NieR:Automata has spawned stage plays, novels, manga, anime, merchandise, cross-overs, collaborations, and more.</p>
<p>The last time we got a new game was <strong>Nier Reincarnation</strong>, a mobile gacha game in 2021 that has since ended global service. Of course, something fans want is a console version of that game akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> (re: <strong>Champions of the Continent</strong>), but that could be a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Oh, and this also isn't the first time Square Enix has teased the future of the series and delivered very little either. But Square Enix did single out the series late last year, stating that the company was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/square-enix-teases-more-for-dragon-quest-nier-and-final-fantasy-in-2026">"preparing 'just a little something'"</a>. So who knows.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>"We’re looking forward to talking more about 'Rayman' soon"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="07c5092ab7dbc"><a title="Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/07c5092ab7dbc/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week's PlayStation State of Play brought us the welcome news that Rayman is <em>back</em>, thanks to the Digital Eclipse-developed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a>. And for the once-iconic platforming legends, it seems this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has told <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> that Rayman, who debuted back in 1995, "is a landmark franchise for Ubisoft and holds a special place in my heart".</p>
<p>The recent Anniversary Edition is apparently just "the first step in the brand’s comeback". And Guillemot says that, with this rerelease, it's "inspiring to see players continue to embrace Rayman’s unique charm and enduring appeal".</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8ljhnyo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The future seems bright for the character, then, as Guillemot states that "we're always exploring how our iconic franchises can evolve and reinvent themselves" and, with Rayman in particular, "We can’t share details today, but we’re looking forward to talking more about Rayman soon."</p>
<p>So, expect <em>some</em> kind of news in the future. What that will be, we have no idea, but we're glad to see the icon return, especially after going so quiet after the numerous ports of the outstanding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Rayman: Legends</a> and his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_plus_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_dlc_3_rayman_in_the_phantom_show">Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC</a>.</p>
<p>As for the now, Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition is centre stage, and this digital museum includes playable versions of the PlayStation, Atari Jaguar, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance releases of the original, extra levels from Rayman Designer, Rayman 60 Levels, and Rayman By His Fans, and a playable prototype of the cancelled SNES release.</p>

<p>Some early impressions haven't been too kind to the game, with reports of bugs and a "reimagined" soundtrack that fans say is inferior to the PS original. Apparently Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-reportedly-aware-of-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-ost-requests">looking into a way of allowing players to swap between the old and new music</a>, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>The full Variety interview (linked up top and below) also covers some of the recent controversies surrounding the French video game publisher and developer, including the cancellation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">six major projects</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-staff-push-back-against-company-restructure-with-three-day-strike">strike action across the company</a> in the wake of mass company layoffs and restructuring.</p>
<p>While the Assassin's Creed franchise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/assassins-creed-has-overperformed-this-quarter-says-ubisoft">apparently "overperformed" last quarter</a>, Ubisoft is very much under the microscope in the industry after a tumultuous few years. Whether Rayman can weather the storm remains to be seen.</p>
