The nine winners will then go head-to-head in a final poll at the end of the month.</p>
<p>We're covering a generation a day until we've ticked off all nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days</strong>.</p>
<p>It's the sixth day, and Gen VI has arrived, which means we're looking at a slighter selection of new Pokémon that came along in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">Pokémon X &amp; Y.</a> Before voting, let's see which underdogs Team NL has in mind.</p><div><figure data-videoid="AHw_vY0WAqU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHw_vY0WAqU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytAHw_vY0WAqU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AHw_vY0WAqU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHw_vY0WAqU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed393988wrmipt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>So, let's get six-y. Only 72 new 'mon today, listed in National Dex order (use the search bar to quickly find a specific Pokémon). As you should know by now, <strong>you can only choose one!</strong></p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Keep an eye out for further generations in the coming days as we cruise towards Pokémon's 30th anniversary.</em></p>
<p><em>And if you missed Gens 2, 3, 4, or 5, those polls are still live:<br></em></p>

<figure data-uuid="6018a6ab1009b"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6018a6ab1009b/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We weren't the only ones to draw the <strong>Dragon Quest Builders</strong> link when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> was first unveiled last year, and it was with good reason. As it turns out, we have Builders dev Omega Force to thank for the game's speedy development time.</p>
<p>That is according to Pokopia producer Kanako Murata, who, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-boasts-largest-development-team-in-omega-force-history-with-dragon-quest-builder-2s-game-and-art-director-on-board/">Automaton</a>), confirmed that the team brought in director Takuto Edagawa and art director Marina Ayano to share some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> pearls of wisdom.</p>
<p>Edagawa and the Omega Force team apparently got on board after seeing senior director's Shigeru <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-pokopias-roots-go-back-further-than-you-think">Ohmori's early prototype</a>, which was inspired by his time working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby and Sapphire</a> back in the day. According to Edagawa, this prototype provided such a clear rundown of what Game Freak wanted to achieve with Pokopia, that Omega Force knew it'd be able to contribute to development.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fuwtrij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The game director went on to say that the teams worked closely together for three to four months before development officially started, ironing out any potential gameplay creases and tweaking the central ideas. While he didn't provide any specific dates, Pokopia development apparently wrapped up pretty quickly thanks to this collaborative planning effort, with many of the major hurdles dealt with way in advance.</p>
<p>This is reportedly the biggest team that Omega Force has ever mustered for a game, and while Edagawa and Ayano are new to working on the series, they believe they've made something that can be proudly delivered to Pokémon fans.</p>
<p>From the small amount that we've played so far, we have to agree! "Despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations," Ollie Reynolds wrote in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/despite-low-expectations-pokemon-pokopia-had-me-grinning-from-ear-to-ear">hands-on preview</a>, "Pokopia was a huge surprise which had me grinning ear to ear". We're excited to see even more when the full game launches on <strong>5th March</strong>.</p>
