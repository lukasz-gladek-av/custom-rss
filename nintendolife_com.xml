<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</a> is getting another DLC expansion in the form of '<strong>The Namco Legendary Pack DLC</strong>'.</p>
<p>No release date has been set at the time of writing, but the new DLC will contain an additional timeline looking at Namco's history with Atari, along with multiple playable versions of <strong>Atari PAC-MAN</strong>, <strong>GALAGA</strong>, <strong>GALAXIAN</strong>, <strong>DIG DUG</strong>, and <strong>XEVIOUS</strong>.</p>
<p>You can expect a whole load of new photos, archival material, videos, and interviews, with the trailer highlighting more footage from the interview between Atari's co-founder Nolan Bushnell and current CEO Wade Rosen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 3 Atari PAC-MAN games: PAC-MAN 2600, 5200, and Atari 8-bit. This marks the first ever re-release of these games for consoles.</p>
<p>- Interactive timeline exploring the history of Namco titles on Atari consoles featuring video interviews with developers, archival materials and documents, photos from the era, and more.</p>
<p>- The U.S. arcade versions of DIG DUG and XEVIOUS, developed by Namco in Japan and originally released by Atari, re-released in this form for the first time ever.</p>
<p>- Home console versions of GALAGA, XEVIOUS, GALAXIAN, and DIG DUG.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not all, though. For the Atari enthusiasts out there, the company has also announced an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP3JZ1RMdEA">Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition</a>, featuring a custom design based on the Pac-Man IP with a bonus double-feature game including the brand-new Pac-Man 7800 and the original Pac-Man 2600.</p>
<p>The cartridge will also be made available separately, or via a new '<a href="https://atari.com/products/high-score-collection-7800">High-Score Collection set</a>', which includes all aforementioned games for either the Atari 2600+ or Atari 7800+ (or, indeed, the original 7800).</p>
<p>Atari 50 has already been expanded with two additional DLC packs; one looking at 'The Wider World of Atari', and the other looking at 'The First Console War'.</p>

<p>Return of the Kong</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last week Donkey Kong returned to the world of 3D platforming over 25 years since his last fully-3D outing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK64</a> - and what a return it was!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> scored an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Jim's review</a>, and most of Team NL has spent this weekend having a smashing time catching up with DK, Diddy, Dixie, and (Void) co. in what Jimbo described as "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184766 @ 1753108265 -->
<p>At the time of writing, the game is enjoying "Universal Acclaim" with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/">Metascore of 90</a>, but now everyone has had their chance to go bananas with it, we're wondering if you concur. How would you rate DKB?</p>
<p>While many of you might have blasted through the entire game over the weekend, if you're anything like us your minecart will have gotten derailed by the countless distractions and doohickeys away from the critical path. If you haven't finished the game, no sweat - voting in the poll below doesn't mean your score has to stay the same.</p>
<p>Yes, you can come back at any time to either change your score or add one when you've settled on a rating from 1-10. If you've already rated the game in our database, thank you kindly - your score already counts! If not, feel free to drop your mark below and let's find out how Bananza measures up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-donkey-kong-games-of-all-time">DK's big bunch of other games</a>.</p>
