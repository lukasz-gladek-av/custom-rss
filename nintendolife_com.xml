            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/reminder-you-can-use-non-nintendo-usb-cameras-with-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03c6d943f55be/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Check out the official details for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> USB camera compatibility on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-USB-Cameras-2785632.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq6zK5mTXSBzpSY011GVRE952hwn0jSzgAUKbx6ToaOJmHWyDEh">Nintendo's website</a> and you'll be greeted with a surprisingly straightforward message from the Big N stating that, "You can use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately) or any compatible USB-C camera you'd like." Nice!</p>
<p>Of course, the reality is that nothing is ever quite so easy; Nintendo does qualify that some cameras may not work and you'll need to use the handy compatibility test found in the new console's settings. This is great, but not much use when you haven't bought the camera yet.</p>
<p>As it turns out, choosing a camera — besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">the official one</a>, or the not-quite-as-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera-shocking-image-quality-but-its-cuteness-will-snare-you">Hori Piranha Plant one</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/horis-new-switch-2-camera-is-built-for-handheld-play">the other Hori one</a> — can actually be a little bit of a complicated task. Some cameras work, some don't. Simple as that.</p>
<p>And so, as ever, enthusiastic gamers have been stepping into the breach, compiling master lists of Switch 2-compatible cameras that you can browse and/or add to with your own findings, and there are quite a few popular brands popping up in "Not Compatible" sections thus far.</p>
<p>As pointed out at the very top of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/?sort=new">this ongoing master list</a> (and this was news to us), some USB-A cameras do appear to work when plugged into the dock or, with a USB-A to USB-C adapter, plugged into the Switch 2 console. New information has appeared! Indeed, in TV mode, it appears you can just directly plug into the dock to potentially use USB-A cameras you have lying around.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this writer did attempt to use a Blink Dog Security camera connected to the dock, but alas no dice.</p>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64d2528759954/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Okay, this one didn't work, though the power light did flash on and off, so that was something — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking through the Reddit list as it stands right now (which we can't vouch for, mind), you can also see some patterns developing around particular brands. Logitech has a whole bunch of cameras, ranging from cheap to expensive, that are seemingly compatible - and a shoutout to whoever it is that's been using an endoscopy cam. Good job!</p>
<p>Here are a few of the included cameras in the 'working' section with some prices (check out the thread for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">the full, growing list</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aoni A20 - 1080p - $19</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 100 - 1080p - $29</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 105 - 1080p - $45</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 300 - 1080p - $39</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 501 - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microsoft LifeCam Cinema - 720p - $94</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo - 1080p - $47</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo Pro - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>WAYVOSE ‎WVS0015 Endoscope - ?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So there's certainly plenty of non-Nintendo gear out there that's getting the job done at various price points, it would seem.</p>
<p>In terms of cameras that won't work, well, Elgato gear seems to have been totally left out in the cold, as does Sony, Insta360, and Microsoft for the most part. There are some surprises and brand outliers, too, such as the very well-regarded (and expensive) Logitech Brio 4K, which is seemingly having issues</p>
<p>So make sure to give this list — and any others you find popping up online — a good read-through before deciding that a very nice and expensive USB-C camera you've seen should 100% do the job. It may not!</p>

<p>March to the beat</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new overview trailer for the upcoming remaster of a PSP classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, and it looks absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>This one was initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">final Switch 1-focused Direct</a> in late March and is set to come our way on <strong>11th July</strong>.</p>
<p>Those who played either <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/patapon">Patapon</a> or its sequel on PSP back in the mid-2000s won't find too many surprises in the new trailer, but if you missed out, it does a decent job of filling in the blanks. This is a rhythm game where you take control of an army of tiny one-eyed warriors, and help them journey across the land. Every command you give to your team comes in the form of drum beats, which you'll have to bash out on the buttons to make them follow your instructions.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The new trailer runs through most of these commands while showcasing the game's controls and tactical slant, before detailing some of the gimmicks, character classes and quality of life improvements we can expect to encounter next month — shout out to the 'Drum Command Always Display' function.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather sweet. Bandai Namco have assumed publishing duties on this one, but the original Patapon team are hard at work on a spiritual successor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, which is <em>also</em> eyeing-up a Switch release. Man, it's a good time to be a rhythm fan!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-dk-rap-is-back-in-donkey-kong-bananza-but-nobody-told-its-composer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="dk rap credits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebfcd677b20e3/dk-rap-credits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, as we reported on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-the-dk-rap-is-in-donkey-kong-bananza">the DK Rap is back</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which as we all know is a very good thing indeed!</p>
<p>However, one (perhaps expected, on past evidence) little wrinkle is that Grant Kirkhope, the illustrious composer of the DK Rap, alongside music for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">Goldeneye</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/viva_pinata_pocket_paradise">Viva Pinata</a>, and a whole bunch more didn't actually know the rap was going to be used in the game.</p>
<p>As Kirkhope himself explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-wasnt-aware-the-worst-rap-track-in-the-history-of-rap-tracks-would-be-included-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Eurogamer</a>, he hadn't been made aware of this most recent usage, which didn't come as such a big surprise to him.</p>
<p>Describing the rap itself, which he created for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, as "the worst track in the history of rap tracks" (has he not seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Re4aDJL3heA?si=3AdUhICSOqi6iSC1&amp;t=150">the John Barnes rap</a>?) Kirkhope, who also wasn't credited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, pointed out that's just not how Nintendo do things.</p>
<p>Speaking last month about being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/grant-kirkhope-apparently-got-a-bananas-reason-for-his-missing-mario-movie-credit">left out of the movie credits</a>, he explained to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo... Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The composer tried appealing to Nintendo on other levels about being left in the movie credits, but the company won't be budged, it seems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Nintendo are notorious sticklers for the rules they lay down, it's hard to see how we'll get 'Grant Kirkhope' (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/random_childish_gambino_sampled_donkey_kong_country_and_david_wise_definitely_approves">Dave Wise</a>, for that matter) appearing in the credits for Donkey Kong Bananza — and he's gonna have to wait and see like the rest of us, we guess — but at least he's remained humorous about the whole thing. "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Of course, we all know Grant is quite the celebrity in the gaming realm, so we don't think he need worry about being forgotten (this writer will shout his name aloud when the rap starts in Bananza).<em><br></em></p>
<p>Now...should...should we all watch it? You only live once, right?</p>
