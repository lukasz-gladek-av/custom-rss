<p>There's been some fairly heated debate since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, over the remastered collection's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">hefty price tag</a>. It's quite a lot of money for a pair of Wii games, as absolutely phenomenal as they are, there's no getting around it.</p>
<p>However, we do already know that the games present at 4K/1080p on Switch 2 (1080p docked on Switch 1), and that they offer up a sprinkling of new features such as a new Assist Mode, a new chapter of Rosalina's storybook, amiibo support, and what's described as "visual enhancements". How very vague of you, Nintendo.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a> has already been re-released not so long ago as part of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection on Switch, and it's this version that those fine folk over at <a href="https://youtu.be/wOF6b0HgxCA?si=v1yUJir69RRo0CpC">GVG</a> have been checking out in a comparison video that gives us hope that we'll get a little more for our money than Nintendo was being clear about.</p>
<p>You can check out the full video above, which includes a playthrough comparison of the five minutes of Super Mario Galaxy's latest port (on Switch) as posted on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Super-Mario-Galaxy-Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915270.html">Nintendo UK's website</a> versus the one we got with Super Mario 3D All-Stars, giving better examples of texture work that's been done than "visual enhancements" really gets across. Just check out the cobblestones in the area shown below as Mario lands; there's a big difference in the detail.</p>

<p>Cutscenes have also been properly re-rendered this time out, rather than upscaled, which introduced some banding issues in the 3D All-Stars collection - they're now gone, according to GVG. Oh, and the aspect ratio has also been changed to fill the screen. Nice.</p>
<p>Another interesting point to note here is that all the footage on Nintendo's aite, it seems, is from the Switch versions of the games, so we have yet to actually get a look at just how they'll look with the full Switch 2 treatment. Fingers crossed we're in for more of a surprise from these re-releases than first appeared.</p>

<p>"Segaaah!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Sega has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and with it has reignited its rivalry with Nintendo (albeit in a cute, harmless sort of way).</p>
<p>In an effort to pay homage to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPJw4CfkhMU">Sega Genesis vs. SNES advertisement</a> from the early '90s, the new trailer highlights CrossWorlds' high-speed action, broad customisation, and cross-platform compatibility, all the while throwing <em>slight</em> shade at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer starts off with a heavily pixelated look at Mario Kart World (because no one wants to entice the wrath of Nintendo) while stating "We all know <em>that</em> kart racing game, it's great, we don't need to show it to you". A slightly positive note, you might think.</p>
<p>After showcasing Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, however, the trailer then goes back to Mario Kart World, which is represented by a grubby, struggling RV, all the while sarcastically exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, uhh, what if you wanna roam around the open world..?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like we said, it's cute, it's harmless, but it's nevertheless a fun way to look back upon Sega's heritage and reference that, yes, both Sega and Nintendo have major racing games launching in 2025.</p>
<p>A demo for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be launching on Switch this week, so be sure to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/sonic-racing-crossworlds-demo-races-onto-switch-next-week">check out all of the details</a> if you're interested. The game itself will land on Switch on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>, while the Switch 2 version is scheduled for later this year.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51611eee1fa26/nintendo-infograph-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the company has released a handy new infographic showcasing every major game that cropped up during the hour-long broadcast.</p>
<p>Say what you want about the Direct itself, seeing all of these games on one page highlights just how impressive the upcoming line-up of games really is. We've got the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and more. It's a lot.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38bcf2407ad39/nintendo-infograph-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1967619424455704975">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, questions <em>do</em> still remain, including why on earth Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/icymi-if-you-want-to-play-virtual-boy-classics-youll-need-to-buy-one-of-nintendos-accessories">isn't offering a way to play Virutal Boy games without the use of the headset</a> (or cardboard equivalent), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">why the Mario galaxy games are so darn expensive</a> on the Switch. And let's be honest, neither of these will likely be answered.</p>
<p>But if you're wondering <em>"crikey, does the Switch 2 even have games?"</em>, we think the answer is yes, it definitely does. Not all of them will be to your taste, but we feel quite satisfied with the cadence in which new experiences are being released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
