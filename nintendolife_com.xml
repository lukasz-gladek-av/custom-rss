<p>Before we get to our plans, however, let's look back on all the Nintendo news that happened this week. Honestly, it was a rather quiet one. Nintendo launched a series of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-releases-its-me-mario-stop-motion-shorts-watch-them-right-here">stop-motion Mario shorts</a> and the kid-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app in Japan (which we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendos-new-app-reminds-me-of-a-universal-truth-it-feels-good-to-squash-marios-face">hands-on</a> with), rumours of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-ahead-of-marios-40th-anniversary">September Nintendo Direct</a> started bubbling away, and The Pokémon Company revealed another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-mega-evolution-looks-particularly-snazzy">new Mega Evolution</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>We also shared our reviews on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's on the cards for this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187146,187176 @ 1756544403 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have never played Kirby and the Forgotten Land before, so I'm putting that right with the catchily-titled Switch 2 version. I've only played through the first world at this point, but what a sweet little 3D platformer! I'm very much excited to get cosy and play some more of it this weekend.</p>
<p>And I'm keeping Kirby as my main focus for this one. I really want to have it polished off before a certain metroidvania comes to gobble up all my time next week...</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I am fully on the Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar train. Choo Choo. I think the game originally came out at a time when I was probably busy doing some boring school-related thing, so I never actually played the original. Also, I guess I always assumed it was a spin-off? Like the Harvest Moon match-3 game, Frantic Farming? I think they came out within a year of each other and I just assumed they were the same kind of thing. Anyway, the remake is pretty great! It's perhaps a little TOO easy — I'm still in spring of year one and I feel like I've made a ton of progress already — but I think they've finally discovered an art style that doesn't look super cheap or derivative! Hooray. I'd still like the character art to look a little less child-like, but we're making progress at least!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a busy one for me. As Alana mentioned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/poll-ahead-of-silksongs-release-are-you-finally-playing-hollow-knight">earlier this week</a>, I've finally started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>! I'm not sure it's going to have the life-changing impact on me that others experienced seven or eight years ago, but I've enjoyed the couple of hours I've played so far and I'm itching to explore more. But! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> launched on Switch this week - I've been anxious to play that since 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> is also an utter delight. I completed my first game the other day (well, I got the Gold cart, but there's loads more I could do) - Avianos, the turn-based, dinosaur, castle-conquering one. I've still barely touched the vast majority of the others, but what a treat this thing is. You'll be hearing me wax lyrical come December, guaranteed.</p>
<p>And on the theme of dinosaurs, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a> on sale this week. Following a blisteringly successful viewing of the first film, my kids are obsessed with Jurassic Park and I'm along for the ride, grinning wildly and shedding a tear when they sing along to those John Williams themes and overspending on the 30th anniversary sets Lego released a couple of years ago. You know, for the kids. Compared to the actual Lego, €3.99 for the game is an absolute steal, and it's also the best way to show them the rest of the movies without actually showing them the rest of the movies. Let 'em dream, hmm?</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing quite a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment, but the recent reminder that Game Vouchers are on their way out has prompted me to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_2">Pikmin 2</a>. Y'see, I'd like to use the vouchers to get the third and fourth games, but I'd also like to complete the second before I, y'know, start the process. OCD, I guess.</p>
<p>I really want to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> too, and you better believe I'll be sinking a few more hours into the new <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a> demo on PS5 before it disappears!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> last weekend, I’ll finally be wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>, which has gone completely under the radar but is one of the best games I’ve played this year. Creative movement, challenging puzzles, all wrapped up in a Zelda-style overworld with a Metroidvania-esque structure? It’s excellent; do yourself a favour and pick it up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no new games for me this week (you know why), but I will be downloading that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> demo. I’m glad people who’ve never played the series before are checking this one out, and I’m eager to see what the fuss is about with this remake. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

<p>"Just two months to go"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix locked in an October release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> earlier this year, and if you've been wanting an update about how it's progressing, it's now gone gold!</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, the official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragon_quest">Dragon Quest</a> social media account <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1961625174115295508">shared a photo</a> of remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka alongside industry legend and "father of Dragon Quest", Yuji Horii. The team has also taken the time to remind everyone how there's now "just two months to go" until this anticipated release arrives.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1837c7d8e94e/dragon-quest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pair actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-officially-gone-gold-out-this-november">took a similar snap</a> when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> went gold on Switch and other platforms in September 2024.</p>
<p>While this might not seem like much to be excited about, for the developers behind upcoming releases, going gold means main development is complete and ready for the production phase. Of course, teams can still make smaller improvements before launch, and then there's post-launch support <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">in the form of updates</a> and DLC. This kind of news can also be another reassuring sign that everything is still on track.</p>
<p>When Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake does launch for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>, fans will need to buy the game on the Nintendo platform of their choice, as Square Enix has already confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">there's no upgrade path currently planned</a>. Additionally, Switch 2 DLC codes can only be used with this particular version of the game (the same applies to the Switch release).</p>

<p>Keep on rollin'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last February, you might recall how our retro-focused sibling site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/3d-platformer-rollin-rascal-is-a-colourful-love-letter-to-sonic?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlighted a new high-speed game called <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rollin_rascal">Rollin' Rascal</a></strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiomatic/rollin-rascal">this Kickstarter project</a> (drawing inspiration from 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic</a> platformers and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario</a>) had just reached its Nintendo Switch goal, and now, well over a year later, the development team Curiomatic has revealed the title will be coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This information was shared during the developer's recent Direct-style video presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal will be released on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Rollin' Rascal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74da66cc2559/rollin-rascal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Curiomatic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the original Switch version was a stretch goal, the developer further notes how the console ports (in general) will begin production once the full game is complete.</p>
<p>There's no set release date for this title just yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2740750/Rollin_Rascal/">a demo is currently available on Steam</a>, and the team plans to roll out the game's story mode in chapters, starting with the first chapter "early next year". As for the full launch, according to the Kickstarter page, it's estimated to be delivered at some point in June 2026.</p>
<p>Here's a description detailing what exactly you can expect, and the rundown video above goes into the latest development updates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal is a love letter to high-speed 3D platformers like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> with the dynamic interactivity of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Strap in for a thrilling ride filled with speed, excitement, and a cast of endearing characters—an experience that’ll delight classic speedster fans, while also introducing newcomers to the genre!"</p>
