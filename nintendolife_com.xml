<p>During the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the ways Nintendo builds relationships with its consumers. As part of this, it revealed some updated data about the player numbers within its ecosystem as of 30th September 2025.</p>
<p>There are currently <strong>400 million</strong> Nintendo Accounts, and in terms of active Switch Online memberships, there are <strong>34 million users</strong>. Nintendo mentions how there are also <strong>128 million</strong> "annual playing users", further noting:</p>
<p>"The number of annual playing users refers to the number of Nintendo Accounts, out of all Nintendo Accounts registered to a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 system, that used Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 software one or more times during the 12-month data aggregation period. The count does not include use of services such as Nintendo eShop. Past usage data is collected when hardware is connected to the internet, so the results are revised retroactively."</p>

<p>Nintendo says it will continue to bring its entertainment to an "ever-wider audience". In the same briefing, the president noted how the company is extending beyond dedicated video game platforms with movies and videos, character merchandise, mobile apps, and real-world experiences such as the Nintendo Museum, theme parks and Live events.</p>
<p>There were no specific updates attached to this data about future plans for Switch Online content or the Nintendo Classics library going forward, but the company has been regularly updating this subscription service with regular retro game updates, extra bonuses and special apps. Next year it will bolster the service with the Virtual Boy library.</p>
<p>Nintendo Accounts and the Switch Online service also give users access to online play and other features such as GameChat. You can see all this in action in the video above.</p>

<p>The Mario and Zelda movies are just the start</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="5bc86a535252d"><a title="Super Mario Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bc86a535252d/super-mario-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's movie business is already booming following the release of the Mario Movie in 2023, which was a global box office hit.</p>
<p>Since then, it's announced a live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> film, and more recently lifted the lid on <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (a follow up to the first animated Mario Movie). It's also got Nintendo Pictures and Nintendo Stars helping out with the expansion of video and movie content, and Shigeru Miyamoto has been working closely with the current movie projects.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the plan is beyond this, the company's latest financial briefing has now teased there's even more on the way with a simple graphic. The aim is to build a framework for a "consistent release cadence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following up on the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023, we have The Super Mario Galaxy Movie scheduled for release in 2026, and the live-action movie of The Legend of Zelda planned for 2027.</p>
<p>We are continuing to prepare for the ongoing release of movies in the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="de5d4c8cc9d82"><a title="Nintendo Movies" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de5d4c8cc9d82/nintendo-movies.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted in the graphic above, the next movie is The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, due out in April 2026. This will be followed by The Legend of Zelda movie, which is scheduled for 2027. The main characters for the Zelda movie have been cast, but we don't know much else about it at this stage.</p>

It's even led to the Japanese firm decreasing its overall sales forecast for this particular system.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how long the original family of Switch systems will be supported for, ultimately, it comes down to certain market factors. And even though it's selling less overall, sales are still maintaining a steady pace even after the Switch 2's launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jlyivk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's what Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">the company's support of the original Switch</a> going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there's no end-of-life date or anything similar (<em>at least for now</em>), and the original hybrid system will still be available to purchase in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously confirmed future support of the system with upcoming releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> (both due out in 2026), and even a major update scheduled for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, there's still more than enough time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">for the Switch to topple the DS</a> as Nintendo's best-selling system of all time. The only console ahead of it at that point would be Sony's PlayStation 2, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/sorry-nintendo-but-it-doesnt-look-like-switch-will-overtake-ps2-as-the-best-selling-console-of-all-time?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">but the two systems are currently about six million sales apart</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo's systems haven't always had the best third-party support, but the Switch 2 has got off to an incredibly strong start with developers and publishers you might not have even expected to see once upon a time now bringing major IP to this new hardware.</p>
<p>The firm has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-highlights-strong-third-party-relationships-ahead-of-switch-2-reveal">acknowledged this strong support</a> once again in its latest financial results briefing, with Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa mentioning how the Switch 2 officially has the "largest third-party software lineup" ever for new Nintendo hardware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Not only have we already seen multiple hit first-party titles, but we have also had many software publishers on board from the very beginning, resulting in the most extensive launch-year lineup out of any of our dedicated video game platforms."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it's early days in the system's life, Furukawa further notes how software publishers have already released a "rich lineup of titles" catering to both "gamers and families". Attached to his comments is a graphic, highlighting the many third-party games that have been released and announced for the Switch 2 so far. This also includes some indie hits.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a793ee0941d6f"><a title="Nintendo Third-Party Support" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a793ee0941d6f/nintendo-third-party-support.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, there are games such as CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and some upcoming games Switch 2 players can look forward to next year include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza 3 Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> from SEGA, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> from Capcom, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> from Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>As we've already highlighted, Nintendo's first-party library for the Switch 2 has also got off to a strong start with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> shifting 9.57 million units, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has hit 3.49 million units. There's also plenty of other upcoming first-party titles to look forward to for the remainder of 2025 including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which is out this week, and then there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> in November and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in December.</p>

<p>As we've now seen, Switch 2 sales have seemingly exceeded Nintendo's expectations, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">after shifting 10.36 million units</a> (as of 30th September 2025) and becoming the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware to date". This has also reportedly resulted in a slump in Switch sales, with Nintendo cutting back its forecast of the original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">has now revealed</a> how 84% of Nintendo Switch 2 players transitioned across from the original Switch systems. This was not only "early adopters" of the original Switch hardware, but also consumers who began playing the Switch at "various points of its lifecycle".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jlyivk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Consumers who purchased Nintendo Switch between its launch in 2017 and the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 have been uniformly migrating to Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see in the slide below, 16% of Switch 2 players are completely "new players". Below this is a breakdown of Switch 2 owners and the time frame when they purchased the original Switch, according to Nintendo's internal data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7e14691bdbb61"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e14691bdbb61/switch-2.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's original Switch system <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">has now sold more than 154 million units</a>, which shows there are still plenty of players out there who have not yet made the shift across to the Switch 2, but likely will at some stage during the new unit's lifecycle.</p>
<p>Furukawa also notes how this data illustrates how existing Switch players are "smoothly transitioning to the Nintendo Switch 2", and allowing Nintendo to maintain relationships with players "across platform generations". Admittedly, it should probably come as no surprise that many of Switch 2's early adopters are existing Switch players, but it's still interesting to see the exact percentage.</p>
