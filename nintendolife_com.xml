<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/motordoom">Motördoom</a> boasts one of those genre mash-ups that it can be difficult to understand, on paper, what's going on. It's a "freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/motordoom-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTU8fWvPp7Dq5U_BZMlbV3GIMzEFtFiA_kA3ELJP5YUD__DqMb">eShop listing</a> reads, which feels like a lot of words for what can basically be boiled down to, <em>kill demons while pulling off sick BMX skills</em>.</p>
<p>This one arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th November</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (the EU page is not live at the time of writing), and it looks really rather gnarly. The above trailer tells you everything you need to know. It's a roguelike where you have to kill as many of the horde demons as possible while pulling off combos on your chainsaw-driven pit bike. Has anything made you want to shout "<em>dude!!</em>" more?</p>
<p>Developer Hobo Cat Games has added a dash of deckbuilder gameplay (because <em>of course</em>) in the shape of cards that boost your abilities, and there are unlockable characters and bikes to give you something to work towards between runs. And putting the 'k' in rogueli<em>k</em>e, an overall meta-progression system will have you gaining bike add-ons for better builds as you go.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>◆Career Mode (Inspired by classic extreme sports games)<br>
◆Single Run Mode (Highscore Mode)<br>
◆Endless Run Mode (Highscore Mode without Time or Level limit)<br>
◆Free Ride Mode<br>
◆Difficulty settings for all skill levels<br>
◆5 Arenas<br>
◆7 Characters<br>
◆5 Bosses<br>
◆35 different Demonic Offering Cards<br>
◆Unlockable Bike Add-Ons<br>
◆Unlockable Bike and Rider Skins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old school polygonal art style might not be to everyone's tastes, but after launching on Steam last year, you just know that such a gnarly mash-up will be up someone's street.</p>
