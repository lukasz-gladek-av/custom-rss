<p>Microsoft and Activision reconfirm</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's platforms were notably absent from the latest <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></strong> announcement, so what exactly is going on here now that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">10-year deal has been done</a> and the Switch 2 is officially in the hands of consumers?</p>
<p>Although there have been no public updates, according to Kotaku's senior reporter Ethan Gach, Nintendo and Microsoft still plan to announce something in the future. It's not exactly the most thrilling development, but when Kotaku reached out to Microsoft about this, it was reassured it's still happening:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But what about the Switch 2? More than two-years after Microsoft and Nintendo entered into an agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to Switch, nothing has materialized. Sources close to the matter tell <em>Kotaku</em> that both sides are still working on it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GameSpot also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">got in contact with Activision</a> and was told "both sides are still working on it" – adding how the team is "committed to getting the franchise on Switch" and details will be shared when they're ready.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Nintendo originally entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo's platforms back in 2022, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/microsofts-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-is-now-legally-binding">deal made legally binding in 2023</a>. This then followed with Microsoft being given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/microsoft-given-all-clear-in-the-us-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> later on in the same year, and <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a></strong> arriving on multiple platforms last year.</p>
<p>So, if you were wondering, yes – Call of Duty is still coming in some way or form to Nintendo's hardware in the future.</p>

<p>A lot of developers have already announced (<em>and released</em>) Switch 2 versions of their existing titles and now Gameloft is joining the club with some news about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>.</p>
<p>In an announcement on social media, it's confirmed its popular life sim will eventually be making its way across to Nintendo's new hybrid platform. In the same message, it also mentioned how the current Switch version is also compatible with the new system.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There are no other details about the dedicated Switch 2 release at this stage, but if we hear anything about a paid upgrade path, free update, or something similar for existing Switch players, we'll let you know. This title was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/disney-dreamlight-valley-will-no-longer-be-free-to-play-when-it-leaves-early-access-in-december">originally planned to be free-to-play</a> and ended up releasing as a paid package.</p>
<p>When it originally arrived on the Switch eShop in September 2022, we called it a "relaxing spin on life sims" but also noted how it was "poorly optimized" for the system. Since then, it's received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/new-disney-dreamlight-valley-update-welcomes-aladdin-and-jasmine-here-are-the-patch-notes">multiple major updates</a> adding new content and experiences.</p>

<p>This event will be taking place at Nintendo Live 2025 Tokyo later this year between 4th and 5th October. Nintendo hasn't shared any other details just yet, but more will be revealed "in the future". This information comes from Nintendo's Australia and New Zealand social media account:</p>

<p>You might recall how Nintendo Live Tokyo was actually cancelled last year after Nintendo cited safety concerns. A <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-threat-suspect-arrested">suspect was eventually arrested</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/mario-kart-8-deluxe-and-splatoon-3-world-championships-get-underway-this-weekend">championships got rescheduled</a>, with an event instead <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/nintendo-live-is-coming-to-sydney-australia-this-year">taking place in Sydney, Australia</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d90314046bd7d/switch-2-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's almost been a week since the arrival of the Switch 2. Now that more outlets have spent some time with Nintendo's new hybrid system, first impressions and reviews are beginning to roll in.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen our own "review-in-progress" here on Nintendo Life, based on what we've experienced so far, we think Nintendo has done a decent job balancing the surprise and delight, while delivering a system that remains familiar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 is a slick bit of kit, though, which instantly makes its predecessor feel slow and look very fuzzy. It makes your old games look and play better, and it's got enough quirks and quality of its own — <em>just</em> — to give it some personality while not upsetting the apple cart."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182525 @ 1749545660 -->
<p>So, what are other outlets saying? For starters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Eurogamer</a> loves the form factor and size of the Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And it's a lovely thing in the hands - larger and, it feels, slightly sleeker than the Switch. And that beautiful glossy screen makes its older sibling look a bit pokey, just as the Switch once made me return to the Vita and say, really? It was that small? And with the border? Just as the Vita once made me go back to the PSP and say..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873/slides/5">Kotaku</a> also praised the "high-end" tech feel of the system and its controllers, and loves the giant panel on the new system, even if it is an LCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s not OLED, but it’s surprisingly crisp, clear, and vibrant for an LCD. It makes the original Switch feel washed out by comparison."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/nintendo/ive-spent-24-hours-with-the-nintendo-switch-2-for-review-heres-5-things-i-love-and-2-things-i-dont">Tom's Guide</a> after 24-hours with the Switch 2 agrees it's more of the same to some degree but a "little bit better":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The mantra of the Switch 2 seems to be taking a thing you love and making it just that little bit better, and that approach extends beyond the console itself and into its official accessories. The freshly upgraded Switch Pro Controller is fundamentally the same great pad that you could buy for Switch 1, but with a few subtle, yet impactful, tweaks."<a href="https://www.stuff.tv/review/nintendo-switch-2-review/"><br></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.stuff.tv/review/nintendo-switch-2-review/">Stuff</a> felt that not all the new features and innovations may appeal, but was glad to see most of the enhancements still pay off:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Not all the new bells and whistles will appeal – GameChat and GameShare are genuine innovations while the mouse function feels too novel and unergonomic – but most of the enhancements do go towards a much better and smoother hybrid gaming experience than before."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/my-switch-2-review-in-progress-its-good-but-dont-give-in-to-the-fomo-yet/">CNET</a> has enjoyed what the new hybrid system offers so far, while acknowleding the change in the video game landscape since the launch of the original Nintendo Switch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo is also in a strange place now. Where it used to compete alone with often unusual hardware, it's now competing against other products with similar goals. The Switch was so spot-on in its vision that it's spawned more handhelds now, and more are likely to come from Sony, Microsoft and others...Nintendo's whimsy and weirdness are its calling cards, and its exclusive games are its edge. The Switch 2 needs to lean hard into that"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">IGN</a>'s "in-progress" review described this "sequel system" as the following upgrade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An iterative upgrade to an already excellent Nintendo console that modernizes many desperately out of date aspects, improves countless design elements in small but noticeable ways, and takes a swing on a genuinely impressive new control option (mouse control) that also doesn’t <em>quite</em> work as smoothly as hoped."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep an eye out for our final review of the Nintendo Switch 2 soon. After almost a week since it launched, how are you finding Nintendo's new system so far? Did you end up getting one in the release week? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the PC Gaming Show earlier on, the team at Aspyr lifted the lid on an enhanced edition of Obsidian Entertainment's 2006 fantasy RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dungeons_and_dragons_neverwinter_nights_2_enhanced_edition">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Neverwinter Nights 2</a>.</p>
<p>Following the release of the original game's enhanced release on the eShop in 2019, the sequel's new version will be releasing for multiple consoles including the Nintendo Switch on <strong>15th July 2025</strong> for $29.99 USD.</p>
<p>It will come packed with a "variety of gameplay enhancements", improved textures, full controller support, all three expansions, and "more".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
