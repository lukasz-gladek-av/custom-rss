<p>What's that? You're still catching up on the news from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer"><em>last</em> Direct</a>? There's no time for that! Nintendo has another showcase up its sleeve, an Indie World to be precise, and it's right around the corner!</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo is keeping the presentations coming today, with the Indie World set to kick off in a little under half an hour at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST</strong>. There's only 15 minutes put aside for this one, but we can expect "new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch", so that's something.</p>
<p>All of this will be heading to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent), but if you'd rather watch with us Nintendo Lifers — and have a bit of a natter along the way — you can do exactly that by checking out the stream below.</p>
<p>We are just minutes away from our second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, so make sure you're sitting comfortably, and let's get ready for some indie news.</p>
