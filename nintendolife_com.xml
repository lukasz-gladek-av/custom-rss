<figure><a title="Xbox Ally" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2684be8ef110c/xbox-ally.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">Xbox</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Xbox has officially entered the handheld space with the announcement of two new devices: the <strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong> and the <strong>ROG Xbox Ally X</strong>.</p>
<p>Launching toward the end of 2025, the new portable systems are the result of a collaboration between Xbox and Asus. They aim to take advantage of Xbox Anywhere, a service that lets you play across console, PC, and supported handhelds.</p>
<p>The standard ROG Xbox Ally comes with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage, while the ROG Ally X rocks 24GB RAM and 1TB SSD storage. The latter also benefits from the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, a step up from the Ally's Z2 A Processor.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, the two look pretty similar, with grips that take inspiration from the Xbox controller and face buttons that will look instantly familiar to those well-acquainted with Microsoft's console line. The main difference is that the Ally X comes in black and the standard Ally in white.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ROG Xbox Ally:</strong> powered by the AMD Ryzen™ Z2 A Processor - balancing performance and power consumption to maximize battery life without sacrificing gameplay quality - 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage.</p>
<p><strong>ROG Xbox Ally X:</strong> features the AMD Ryzen™ AI Z2 Extreme processor - allowing us to bring new experiences to life including greater frames-per-second, sharp visuals and increased intelligence - double the storage to have more native games at your fingertips, and 24GB of high-speed RAM and 1TB of SSD storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, though, as highlighted by our pals over at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/no-the-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-doesnt-play-native-console-games">Pure Xbox</a>, these devices are Windows PC handhelds first and foremost. They don't play console games, but rather native PC titles on Xbox. So essentially, with Xbox Anywhere (which boasts <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/03/microsoft-shares-updated-xbox-play-anywhere-games-list-as-it-unifies-console-and-pc">over 1000 compatible titles</a>), you get a PC version of a game for free when you buy it on an Xbox console.</p>
<p>What's not clear yet, however, is how much these things will cost. Xbox recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/xbox-is-raising-the-price-of-consoles-accessories-and-games-worldwide">raised its prices across the board</a>, and given the specs on these things, we can't imagine either of them will come in at anything less than £500.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the potential price, the rather niche appeal of the systems, <em>and</em> the fact that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-has-been-a-great-partner-phil-spencer-reiterates-switch-2-support">Microsoft is keen to support the Switch 2</a>, we can't imagine Nintendo is even remotely concerned about the new ROG Ally devices. Regardless, we'll be keeping a close eye on future developements and how other companies take inspiration from Xbox's new handhelds.</p>

<p>Game Freak has made games other than Pokémon before. It has also released games on non-Nintendo platforms before. Yet whenever it spices up a launch schedule with either of these curveballs, it never fails to catch us off guard.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Pokémon dev popped up at the Xbox Games Showcase to reveal <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/beast_of_reincarnation">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, the action RPG previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/pokemon-studio-game-freak-is-partnering-with-private-division-on-project-bloom">revealed back in 2023</a> under the codename 'Project Bloom'. It looks awesome, it's arriving at some point in 2026, and Switch / Switch 2... don't appear to be invited to the party right now.</p>
<p>Beast of Reincarnation has been confirmed for launch on Xbox Series X and S, PC and PS5, and, from the little we've seen so far, it certainly seems to be making the most of the beefier consoles' power.</p>
<p>Described as "an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat," Beast of Reincarnation will see you exploring a post-apocalyptic Japan, on a mission to take down a gruesome beastie that brought about mankind's demise. Soooo, <em>not</em> catching cute little bug creatures in the tall grass, then?</p>
<p>Here's a brief summary and a handful of screenshots from the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion.<br>
Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.<br>
Explore what it means to be human in Beast of Reincarnation, an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat.<br>
What awaits at journey’s end?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one was initially announced as a partnership between Game Freak and Private Division, but the latest reveal has a new studio, 'Fictions,' on publishing duties — presumed to be the team built by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/ex-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-pick-up-private-division-portfolio-under-new-studio">former Annapurna Interactive staff</a>.</p>
<p>It all looks very big and impressive, with a scale that we're sure would prove too much for Switch 1. Switch 2, on the other hand, might be able to handle things — it can handle <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>, for crying out loud — but it's still missing from the launch line-up for the time being. Keep those fingers crossed for another announcement soon then, eh?</p>

<p>Over the past few days, there have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombaClub/comments/1l5jikh/tomba_is_not_compatible_with_switch_2_right_now">a few notices posted online</a> regarding Limited Run games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_special_edition">Tomba! Special Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/clock_tower_rewind">Clock Tower: Rewind</a> which aren't currently running properly on Nintendo's slick new console (and both feature on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">Nintendo's lists of games with issues</a>). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/clocktower/comments/1l40f1i/any_idea_when_rewind_will_be_fixed_for_switch_2/">Clock Tower appears to have audio problems</a>, whilst Tomba is fairing a little worse.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a specific line of code has been causing the issues, according to Limited Run founder Josh Fairhurst. Our sister site, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>, reached out to Fairhurst, who has addressed the situation, saying that they had very little time with the console pre-release to deal with a troublesome bug:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zstxhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The backwards compatibility issue derives from a line of code that is used for video playback on the original Switch. We have reported the line of code to Nintendo and are hoping to see it addressed as an update to the Switch 2's backwards compatibility in the future, as I believe this line of code is also causing compatibility issues with games from other publishers.</p>
<p>We were accepted as Switch 2 publishers and developers in mid-May and received our development hardware two weeks ago. We started digging into the issue the minute we got our kits and found the line of code causing the problem after a few days of investigation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LRG published a statement <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1931576962679521441">on social media</a> over the weekend mentioning that the firm was hopeful of this being addressed in future updates from Nintendo. Of course, it is still very early days for Switch 2, so these little bumps in the road are to be expected, and it's at least good news for potential players of Limited Run's Carbon Engine-emulated games that the problem has been identified.</p>
<p>The Carbon Engine, if you're unfamiliar, is Limited Run's multi-platform development tool that helps different emulators interface with modern consoles. It uses emulation as a base, then builds features like UI, rendering, audio, data management, controller inputs, and console-specific features like achievements.</p>
