<p>It's the best one!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The really rather frightening <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</a></strong> is getting a fancy remake. Hooray! Team Ninja is involved. Hooray again! And it's headed to Switch 2 in 2026. Ok that's terrifying, but also hooray...we guess.</p>
<p>This Japanese horror effort, which scared this writer good and proper back when it released for the first time in 2003, is looking like a right atmospheric treat in its fancy new trailer, which you can check out above, and the creepy tale should benefit greatly from the added horsepower of the Switch 2, after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/project_zero_2_wii_edition">Wii port</a> back in the day that was, well it was fine, but it wasn't the best way to play it.</p>

<p>From former Bungie CEO's new studio</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We love the 80s. We love anime. We love them there computer games.</p>
<p>And so, it stands to reason, there's a fair chance we could end up loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, a rather retro-cool-looking 2D action roguelike that's available for Switch today. Exciting!</p>
<p>Today's surprise stealth drop, of a game that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/former-bungie-ceos-studio-probablymonsters-announces-storm-lancers-for-switch">announced a little while back now</a>, sees players blast through a campaign in either solo mode or couch co-op. It looks very like a 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/borderlands_collection_pandoras_box">Borderlands</a> to us in its art style, weapon pick-up descriptions and enemies, which is no bad thing, and the trailer - which you can check out above - shows a decent mix of platforming, boss battling and so on.</p>
<p>The roguelike aspect here comes through the use of "storm hearts", hence the title, which can be upgraded through play for permanent unlocks to carry into your next run. Of course this is also the first game from ProbablyMonsters, so we're very interested to see how it turns out for them.</p>

<p>Fortune of battle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Closing out today's Nintendo Direct was a surprise announcement — we're getting a brand new Fire Emblem game on Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a> looks absolutely incredible and appears to take place in an arid region with a huge colosseum seemingly a central feature.</p>
<p>Expect more tactical gameplay, some rather lovely character designs, and a few hints at some interconnected lore...</p>
<p>Here's what we know so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Heroic Games have begun. The newest entry in the Fire Emblem series is set to enter the arena. The debut trailer provided a glimpse of the intertwining story, characters and turn-based tactical RPG gameplay that awaits players when the game launches for Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>And it's not a Cloud Version!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following recent rumours, Capcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will launch on the Switch 2 alongside the other platforms on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This entry will follow Grace Ashcroft as she investigates mysterious deaths, including that of her mother, <strong>RE: Outbreak's</strong> Alyssa Ashcroft. The game will also feature the ruined remains of Raccoon City and the R.P.D station.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil: Village</a> will be heading to the Switch 2 on the same date. Both titles originally launched on the Switch as Cloud Versions to much criticism, so hopefully these native versions will go toward restoring some faith from Nintendo fans.</p>
