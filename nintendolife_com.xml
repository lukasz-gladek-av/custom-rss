<p>DK...Donkey Kong!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're now just weeks out from the smashing arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2 and Nintendo has now released a overview trailer.</p>
<p>It uploaded plenty of these in the leadup to key releases during the Switch generation and this trend continues with eight minutes of footage for the new Switch 2 exclusive. It highlights DK and Pauline's abilities, transformations, boss battles, and much more.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind this overview is only available on Nintendo's Japanese YouTube channel at the moment but if we get an English version, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we also shared our final preview of Donkey Kong Bananza here on Nintendo Life, and despite some minor technical concerns, his latest adventure is showing all the signs of becoming his greatest outing to date. The game's developer has been confirmed as well.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco ended its latest showcase with another look at <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/digimon_story_time_stranger">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a></strong>. If you were wondering about the possibility of a Nintendo release, there's reportedly been a new development.</p>
<p>As highlighted by multiple sources, a new listing has popped up on the EAN database in Europe which includes a code for an apparent "Switch 2 version". These codes are used by retailers to identify products at sale.</p>

<p>Nothing has been officially announced, so it's probably best to treat this one as a rumour for now. In saying this, Bandai Namco has already got games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> coming to the Switch 2, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise.</p>
<p>The Switch generation also saw multiple Digimon games released physically and digitally. Digimon Story: Time Stranger is currently confirmed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam, and will launch on these platforms in October.</p>
