<figure><a title="Drag X Drive Miis" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca5f41e28f0e2/drag-x-drive-miis.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>August is nearly over, and we've had two first-party releases this month: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Long Title Nintendo Employees Are Obliged to Say in its Entirety</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p>The Kirby revamp just came out (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">and it's very good</a>) while Drag and Drive (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-need-to-talk-about-x-games">yes, this one's definitely an 'and'</a>) hit the courts back on 14th August. Are you still playing it? I'm willing to bet <em>dozens</em> of you are.</p>
<p>Ah, what a shame. For a game that demonstrates some genuine originality, it just throws up too many roadblocks for the average player, whether it's the novel but uncompromising Mouse Mode controls, the dreary presentation, or the restrictive online team options. It makes for an intriguing pitch — and it really is a blast in <em>exactly</em> the right circumstances — but will anyone be playing this come Christmas? Is anyone playing it now?</p>
<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d7a0d5a6202e/joy-con-2-mouse-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I found myself wishing I could just control the thing with standard stick and button inputs. I know that would circumvent the game's USP and introduce a skill gap, as people using buttons would quickly and easily (I imagine) outperform players sticking to motion controls, so you'd need to split the playerbase via control scheme.</p>
<p>And for a game that's designed to show you the real gameplay possibilities of Mouse Mode beyond the obvious (and beyond the minigames in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>), optional button inputs would be tantamount to admitting defeat. "Yeah, this is <em>our</em> Mouse Mode showcase! But you don't <em>have to</em> use them.<sub>..and it's easier and better if you don't.</sub>"</p>
<p>I reckon Nintendo could frame it as an accessibility win without losing too much face. Ironically, players with any sort of movement impairment in their upper body will likely struggle the most playing Drag x Drive. And given the game's muted debut, alternative control schemes would likely draw in a far larger player base. It's not too late if Nintendo just swallowed its pride.</p>

<p>It's an odd one, because I admire the boldness of the idea and the mechanical execution. Only Nintendo would do something like this, but it's looking like a one-and-done affair for all but the most devoted players with the optimal setups (3v3 over LAN at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience).</p>
<p>I had a great time with it back in April, and really hoped that would translate to the game proper, which I assumed would have more meat on the bone beyond the demo I played. Bolstered by Nate Bihldorff's comments in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-really-want-to-future-proof-the-nintendo-switch-2-interview">our interview</a> that, "in typical Nintendo fashion, there's more game beyond that," I assumed we'd seen only a small slice of the pie.</p>
<p>But no. Beyond the minigames, it's pretty much exactly what I played in April ad infinitum. Can you imagine what a difference a simple change of scenery would make? An outside court by the beach or up a mountain wouldn't fundamentally change anything, but would <em>drastically</em> improve the pervading presentational drabness. Perhaps Nintendo didn't want to distract from the novel mechanics with any trademark colour, but jeez. After half an hour you're jonesing for something beyond Burnished Black, Weathered Chrome, Medium Grey, Metallic Grey, Dark Grey, Dark Sea Grey, Neutral Grey, Grey Grey...</p>

<p>Or how about an injection of personality with some characters? Nintendo's got a few of those, right? <em>Something</em>. I thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Switch Sports</a> was bland, but Drag x Drive is crying out for some <em>verve</em> and charisma beyond the mechanical thrills.</p>
<p>Perhaps there's a sensitivity and reluctance on Nintendo's part to sitting Mario and co. in wheelchairs, and I understand that a whole other, valid conversation around representation would come from just slotting in Mushroom Kingdom characters that demonstrably, famously, have zero mobility issues. But featureless robots with customisation that extends to a splash of colour and some cat ears? They won't cause offence, sure, but they aren't a satisfactory solution. You can't even make them look like Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Just adding Miis would give the game 1000% more personality. You still wouldn't want to be stuck with it at a party, but right now it feels like a brick wall in the presentation department - a complete turn-off. That is, if the controls didn't make you <a href="https://c.tenor.com/yTxA7WgkBEUAAAAd/tenor.gif">Abe Simpson outta there</a> beforehand.</p>
<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/623656888f3d6/joy-con-2-mouse-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before launch, we'd worried that DxD might turn out to be Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, a game we loved and which still sold multiple millions of copies, but which didn't capture the audience it arguably deserved. Drag x Drive, though, feels like it ground to a halt almost immediately, not even able to sustain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo</a>-levels of novelty. It's got my respect, but the surprise and delight was incredibly fleeting with this one. Imagine if it had an ounce of ARMS or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a>'s style to go with the game.</p>
<p>Is there a way Nintendo could pivot and pull it back? Could Miis or regular button inputs change things for you? Would you be upset if they added DxD as a free-to-play perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers? Let us know in the polls and comments.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition-unnerving-horror-loop-is-worth-the-budget-price.1284708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>To celebrate the newly-released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emZZexEJO8c">movie adaptation</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Exit 8</a>, the Switch version has received a minor, yet welcome upgrade for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're unaware of the premise, The Exit 8 takes place in a looping corridor within a Japanese metro station. Your job is to escape, but to do so, you’ll need to keep an eye on your surroundings, as each loop through the corridor may reveal some odd ‘anomalies’.</p>
<p>If there aren't any anomalies, you simply carry on, but if you spot something out of the ordinary, then you’ll have to turn back. You need to make the correct decision eight times in a row to escape, with a yellow sign indicating which ‘level’ you’re currently at. So if you get it wrong, you’ll reset right back down to zero.</p>
<p>The corridor itself is covered with white tiles, with posters on the left, a few doors on the right, and a sign up above labelled ‘Exit 8’. In each loop, you’ll spot a man walking in the opposite direction — briefcase in one hand, phone in the other. It’s important to keep note of small details like this, as potential anomalies are either blatantly obvious or exceedingly difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Some of the more subtle anomalies might be rearranged posters, a flickering light, or a door left slightly ajar. Meanwhile, the more obvious ones may be a pair of figures blocking your way, the briefcase man suddenly following you <em>very</em> closely, or what I can only assume is blood flooding the corridor. New anomalies have been added to pay homage to the movie, but unless you're intimately familiar with the original, you might not pick up on these.</p>
<p>Not knowing what's around the corner is a large part of what makes The Exit 8 so engaging, but it's also a source of frustration. There were many times I walked through the corridor utterly convinced that nothing had changed, only to find was back at level zero. So you need to take your time and be consistently observant.</p>
<p>On the Switch 2, the game’s performance has been given a nice bump, and it feels like it’s running at a stable 60fps. I wouldn’t say it’s a particularly pretty game, though, and the overall presentation is a little fuzzy in handheld mode, with text on the in-game posters looking quite blurry unless you’re standing right next to them.</p>
<p>I would've liked to see gyro aiming here too, just to make observation a little more intuitive, but the standard twin-stick setup works well enough. It’s such a simple game that every face and shoulder button does the exact same thing: sprint.</p>
<p>Overall, The Exit 8 is a cool experience that's worth trying for the low price, but not one I imagine going back to anytime soon. I wouldn’t call it scary, but there are definitely moments that made me feel uneasy. I think if the developer had really leaned into the horror and made something a bit closer to Hideo Kojima’s <strong>P.T</strong>, we could have had a modern classic here.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before we get to our plans, however, let's look back on all the Nintendo news that happened this week. Honestly, it was a rather quiet one. Nintendo launched a series of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-releases-its-me-mario-stop-motion-shorts-watch-them-right-here">stop-motion Mario shorts</a> and the kid-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app in Japan (which we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendos-new-app-reminds-me-of-a-universal-truth-it-feels-good-to-squash-marios-face">hands-on</a> with), rumours of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-ahead-of-marios-40th-anniversary">September Nintendo Direct</a> started bubbling away, and The Pokémon Company revealed another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-mega-evolution-looks-particularly-snazzy">new Mega Evolution</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>We also shared our reviews on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's on the cards for this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187146,187176 @ 1756594713 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have never played Kirby and the Forgotten Land before, so I'm putting that right with the catchily-titled Switch 2 version. I've only played through the first world at this point, but what a sweet little 3D platformer! I'm very much excited to get cosy and play some more of it this weekend.</p>
<p>And I'm keeping Kirby as my main focus for this one. I really want to have it polished off before a certain metroidvania comes to gobble up all my time next week...</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I am fully on the Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar train. Choo Choo. I think the game originally came out at a time when I was probably busy doing some boring school-related thing, so I never actually played the original. Also, I guess I always assumed it was a spin-off? Like the Harvest Moon match-3 game, Frantic Farming? I think they came out within a year of each other and I just assumed they were the same kind of thing. Anyway, the remake is pretty great! It's perhaps a little TOO easy — I'm still in spring of year one and I feel like I've made a ton of progress already — but I think they've finally discovered an art style that doesn't look super cheap or derivative! Hooray. I'd still like the character art to look a little less child-like, but we're making progress at least!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a busy one for me. As Alana mentioned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/poll-ahead-of-silksongs-release-are-you-finally-playing-hollow-knight">earlier this week</a>, I've finally started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>! I'm not sure it's going to have the life-changing impact on me that others experienced seven or eight years ago, but I've enjoyed the couple of hours I've played so far and I'm itching to explore more. But! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> launched on Switch this week - I've been anxious to play that since 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> is also an utter delight. I completed my first game the other day (well, I got the Gold cart, but there's loads more I could do) - Avianos, the turn-based, dinosaur, castle-conquering one. I've still barely touched the vast majority of the others, but what a treat this thing is. You'll be hearing me wax lyrical come December, guaranteed.</p>
<p>And on the theme of dinosaurs, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a> on sale this week. Following a blisteringly successful viewing of the first film, my kids are obsessed with Jurassic Park and I'm along for the ride, grinning wildly and shedding a tear when they sing along to those John Williams themes and overspending on the 30th anniversary sets Lego released a couple of years ago. You know, for the kids. Compared to the actual Lego, €3.99 for the game is an absolute steal, and it's also the best way to show them the rest of the movies without actually showing them the rest of the movies. Let 'em dream, hmm?</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing quite a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment, but the recent reminder that Game Vouchers are on their way out has prompted me to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_2">Pikmin 2</a>. Y'see, I'd like to use the vouchers to get the third and fourth games, but I'd also like to complete the second before I, y'know, start the process. OCD, I guess.</p>
<p>I really want to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> too, and you better believe I'll be sinking a few more hours into the new <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a> demo on PS5 before it disappears!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> last weekend, I’ll finally be wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>, which has gone completely under the radar but is one of the best games I’ve played this year. Creative movement, challenging puzzles, all wrapped up in a Zelda-style overworld with a Metroidvania-esque structure? It’s excellent; do yourself a favour and pick it up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no new games for me this week (you know why), but I will be downloading that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> demo. I’m glad people who’ve never played the series before are checking this one out, and I’m eager to see what the fuss is about with this remake. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>
