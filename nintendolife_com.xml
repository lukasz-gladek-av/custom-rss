<p>"I... so unhappy..."</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Happy 25th anniversary to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a>, the final mainline Final Fantasy game to launch on the original PlayStation and one of the most beloved entries in the entire franchise.</p>
<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/topics/599">posted an update</a> on the Final Fantasy IX anniversary website — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/final-fantasy-9-remake-hopes-rise-as-square-enix-teases-anniversary-projects">which opened earlier this year</a> — to celebrate. And, the question on everybody's lips is obvious; where is the rumoured Final Fantasy IX remake, Square??</p>
<p>Well, it's not here! Square Enix has been running a number of projects for the RPG over the past few months, from brand new artwork to new merchandise reveals. The 7th July 2025 <em>could</em> have been something big, and many thought the celebrations would lead up to the long-rumoured remake, which was one of the many games that was revealed as part of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/huge_nvidia_database_leak_lists_unannounced_third-party_games">Nvidia GeForce leak in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, we got an <a href="https://youtu.be/oFDDlEaUXxw?si=ScDX2lCL-u6AaGgI">anniversary video</a> and <a href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/ceform.php?id=441&amp;la=1&amp;h=cbf426fd&amp;_gl=1*1o6y2zy*_gcl_au*NTg4MjIyODgxLjE3NTE4OTM0MTQ.">a fan art project</a>, which is running until 31st October 2025.</p>

<p>Sooo... not the big blow-out fans were hoping for, but there's still time, right? Well, there might be cause for concern.</p>
<p>Podcaster and notable industry "leaker" NateTheHate has shared a potential (with a big pinch of salt) update on the progress of the remake on the forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/page-31#post-142366968">Resetera</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ltbe6h/natethehatenate_drake_on_resetera_final_fantasy/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>).</p>
<p>"As of last check it remains in development, to my knowledge," Nate starts his message, but admits he needs to do a "fresh check" as "I did hear a month or so ago that it was in trouble &amp; possibly cancelled." This only came from one source, though, so don't take it to mean much until it's fully verified.</p>
<p>While the Nvidia leak has proven to be pretty accurate up until this point, it's worth reminding everyone that the Final Fantasy IX remake hasn't been officially announced. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a> was only just revealed, and that was on there, so we're still praying Final Fantasy IX will get the love it deserves.</p>
<p>You know when Domino's Pizza is asking for the remake that people are desperate for it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, go and enjoy some of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/final-fantasy-9-gets-some-gorgeous-new-artwork-and-it-has-fans-in-a-frenzy">that stunning anniversary artwork</a> Square Enix was posting on social media last week.</p>

And while Capcom's beloved Blue Bomber hasn't had a brand new game since 2018's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_11">Mega Man 11</a>, the Japanese developer insists that he's "one of our most important IPs".</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2025capcom_c.pdf">Capcom's 46th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders Q&amp;A</a>, the company was asked directly about plans it has for the Mega Man series.</p>
<p>The response is, predictably, a little vague, but Capcom acknowledges Mega Man's importance. "The Mega Man series is one of our most important IPs, and we are continuously considering ways to develop it further," the notes state.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wolpys&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>However, as for the future of the series, there's nothing to report: "we do not have any additional<br>
information we can share at this time."</p>
<p>It's not as if Capcom has forgotten about Mega Man, of course; we got the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_battle_network_legacy_collection">Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection</a>, a compilation of the GBA grid-based RPGs from the 2000s, in 2023, and <strong><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/megaman/xdive-offline/en-us/">Mega Man X DiVE</a></strong> is playable offline on mobiles.</p>

<p>But the fact that it's been more than seven years since a mainline Mega Man game is a little bit of a sting for fans, surely. But Mega Man 11 is also the series' best-selling game, and it reached the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/capcoms-best-selling-mega-man-game-reaches-another-sales-milestone1">2 million milestone earlier this year</a>.</p>
<div><p>Capcom at least is aware of the character's popularity worldwide, and told shareholders that, regarding merchandise "we receive a particularly high volume of inquiries about the Mega Man series from overseas markets" and that the company "will continue to focus on expanding this business further."</p><p>

If you want some Mega Man action on your Switch 2, you can obviously dig out those Legacy Collections, but if you have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, you can actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-can-play-one-of-the-greatest-platformers-of-all-time-in-street-fighter-6">play one of the NES games in-game there</a>.</p></div>
