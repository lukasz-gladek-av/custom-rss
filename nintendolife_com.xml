<p>As we have come to expect from retro compilations like this, the Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy Collection gives you the chance to rewind gameplay and save from anywhere, as well as other additions like a music player and an artwork museum.</p>
<p>It'll come as no surprise to hear that there are a few different purchase options from <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/ren-stimpy-happy-happy-joy-joy-collection-standard-edition-switch-ps5-pc?variant=44905135308853">LRG</a> (once pre-orders open on 30th January), including a 'Classic Edition' for <strong>$69.99</strong>, which comes with a retro VHS cover and a steelcase, and a 'Collector's Edition' for <strong>$109.99</strong>, which packs in a bunch of extra merch like a CD, poster, mini cartridge replicas, an acrylic standee and more.</p>
<figure data-uuid="08c0142f50b63"><a title="Ren &amp; Stimpy Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08c0142f50b63/ren-and-stimpy-happy-happy-joy-joy-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>These pre-orders will only be sticking around until 1st March, so you better get saving your pennies if you want to grab the merch-packed edition. While there's no specific release date just yet, Limited Run estimates that the physical editions should ship sometime between July and September 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Side-Scrolling Robo-Shooter Remake 'FZ: Formation Z' Blasts Onto Switch 2 This May]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/side-scrolling-robo-shooter-remake-fz-formation-z-blasts-onto-switch-2-this-may</link>
            <guid>1418449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>City Connection and Granzella have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fz-formation-z">FZ: Formation Z</a>, the side-scrolling robot shooter from all the way back in the perm-riddled dark days of 1984 (so long ago this writer had a full head of hair!), is to be resurrected on Switch 2 this very year (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2026/01/city-connection-and-granzellas-formation-z-remake-finally-has-a-release-date">Time Extension</a>).</p>
<p>Now, 1984 is a long time ago, yes, and so you may be thinking 'meh' to the idea of resurrecting something so very antiquated. Until you check out the trailer at the top of this article, that is. Also, you may have already played the OG game already on Switch via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_formation_z">Arcade Archive re-release</a> and are now just a rabid fan. Welcome, either way!</p>
<p>It does seem as though the devs here have gone to town with this remake of a Jaleco golden oldie, with a full revision of everything from the graphics, gameplay, and sound, whilst "staying true to the classic gameplay and intuitive controls of switching between Robot and Flight forms". They've even brought new weapons to the table. It certainly looks like a good time, judging by the intense and colourful action on show in the gameplay vid, with some very nice <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/r-type_dimensions_ex">R-Type</a>-but-with-big-stonking-robots vibes that this writer is here for all day long.</p>
<p>The remake will release in Japan on 21st May across multiple platforms, and although a Western release hasn't been officially confirmed for Switch at the time of writing, the trailer above does contain the Clear River Games logo, who were attached to publish the game in Europe according to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/11/embracer-group-interim-report-leaks-fz-formation-z-western-release-plans">a release plan leak from Embracer Group</a>. So, fingers crossed, then.</p>
<p>More good news: It'll arrive in both digital and physical forms, and the physical isn't a Game-Key Card, either. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Digital editions will set you back 4400 yen (so roughly £20 or whatever that is where you're located). The physical edition comes in two flavours: a fancy Limited Edition for 14,850 yen (around the £70 mark) which includes a soundtrack, robot-making kit, bonus weapon content and a fancy box for presentation, and a slightly less snazzy standard physical for 5,940 yen (almost 30 British pounds).</p>
<p>Finally, here's some more official details, as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2728420/FZ_Formation_Z/">the Steam page</a>, and some screens:</p>
