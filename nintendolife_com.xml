<p>This physical reward is "available while supplies last" and shipping fees apply. This offer is also only available to My Nintendo members.</p>
<p>Some other locations have also received new merch alongside the release of Donkey Kong Bananza this week - including Australia and New Zealand. Although there are no new DK rewards on the My Nintendo Store in this particular location at the moment, there are new DK-themed items available for purchase (<a href="https://www.vooks.net/fresh-donkey-kong-gear-arrives-on-the-my-nintendo-store/">thanks for the heads up, Vooks</a>).</p>
<p>In some related news, Nintendo has also released a new set of Donkey Kong Bananza Switch Online icons. Here's a look:</p>
