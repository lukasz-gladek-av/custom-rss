<p>At least, according to Kadokawa's latest financial report</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="38beb9716a6bd"><a title="The Duskbloods" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38beb9716a6bd/the-duskbloods.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: FromSoftware</em></figcaption></figure><p>If everything goes to plan, FromSoftware is poised to have a big 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> were announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct in April 2025, but things have been pretty quiet for both games since.</p>
<p>However, both titles have been mentioned in Kadokawa's (FromSoftware's owner) <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">Earnings Report for Q3 2025/26</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-owner-reiterates-duskbloods-is-still-coming-this-year-exclusive-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), and both are still aiming for a 2026 release window. Unfortunately, responses in the report are pretty vague, but at least both games are still alive, right?</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytDE5HpSoUj-c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbvylirh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>When asked about a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Kadokawa merely states that "we have yet to announce a specific release date", but the question does wonder whether the game is included in the fiscal year's outlook, which Kadokawa "[has] not disclosed". So maybe don't expect it in the next month.</p>
<p>It's a similar story for The Duskbloods, where Kadokawa again says it hasn't announced "a specific release date". The report does confirm that it'll be sold on a joint basis with Nintendo "with sales responsibilities divided by region" and reiterates that the game will be a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>

<p>So, that's all we're getting for now, it seems. We'll likely just have to wait until the next big Nintendo Direct to hear <em>something</em>. And even then, it isn't a guarantee.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was actually meant to come out in 2025; as a port of the critically-acclaimed open world RPG, it'll include a few brand new jobs and includes the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Early hands-on reports at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">were pretty negative</a> regarding the state of the port, but fans and critics have come away <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/heres-another-look-at-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2">a bit happier with later builds</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we've heard or seen next to nothing of The Duskbloods since its reveal, besides a brief little clip at The Game Awards last year and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-duskbloods-could-be-fromsoftwares-most-ambitious-game-yet-according-to-leak">a little leaker tidbit</a> which claims the game contains "many innovative elements the team themselves are very proud of". We know it's a PvPvE game where you pick a vampire-like character and customise them in order to go out and fight others online, and... that's about it.</p>
<p>Regardless, we're looking forward to seeing more of them this year, hopefully.</p>

<p>It's the little things</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you cast your mind back to 2024, you might recall an adorable-looking little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_garden">Tiny Garden</a>, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/cosy-polly-pocket-inspired-farm-sim-tiny-garden-smashes-kickstarter-goal-in-one-hour">smashed its Kickstarter goal</a> in under an hour with the promise of a Switch release to come. Well, guess what! It's coming our way real soon.</p>
<p>Super Rare Originals and Ao Norte have today announced that Tiny Garden will sprout onto the Switch eShop on <strong>26th February</strong>, bringing us heaps of '90s nostalgia and cosy vibes in the process.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, this is a cute farming/decoration sim, set inside a "'90s inspired clam-shelled toy" — if you remember your ample Polly Pocket collection from back in the day, this'll likely ring a bell. The bottom half of this toy is your garden, where you'll plant crops before turning the little handle on the side to watch them grow (<em>adorable</em>), while the top is a tiny little house for you to decorate as you please.</p>
<p>After launching on Steam last year, the Switch version bundles in the Summer Breeze Cosmetic Pack DLC and Supporter's Pack, meaning even more cosmetics and items will be at your disposal right from the jump.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Super Rare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Pocket-Sized! -</strong> Build your dream garden inside this 90's inspired clam-shelled toy.<br>
- <strong>Relax, Discover, Create -</strong> Turn the crank and enjoy a wholesome and thoughtful experience!<br>
- <strong>Relaxation and Creativity -</strong> No score, time limits, or game overs, Tiny Garden is all about unwinding and creating without pressure!<br>
- <strong>A Toy With History -</strong> Discover the toys secrets as you uncover letters and traces of the stories shared within.<br>
- <strong>Nintendo Switch version includes the Summer Breeze Cosmetic Pack</strong>, which brings new customisations to your game!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, it looks <em>ridiculously cute</em>. We're all after an antidote to the endless grey outside, and this might just provide it.</p>
