Ahead of the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</a> *<em>inhales</em>* arriving on consoles tomorrow, the reviews are in... and they're looking pretty strong.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this is the same base game as the 2022 3D platformer, with a bunch of new content in the shape of additional 'Star-Crossed' levels, new Mouthful Modes and more. It also makes the most of the Switch 2's boosted power, offering crisp 60fps gameplay, no matter which mode you play.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We had a wonderful time with the pink puffball's latest, with the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granting it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">our review</a> and calling it "easily one of the best and most polished 3D platformers on Switch or Switch 2".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186479 @ 1756303285 -->
<p>But we're not the only ones with a review out there, so let's check out what some other outlets made of it, to highlight the full range of opinions — even if the options go from 'really good' to 'ever-so-slightly less good'.</p>
<p>Starting at the top, <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-105645-20250827">GAMINGbible</a> opted for a similarly positive 9/10, praising the new levels and the slight increase in challenge that they bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</em> takes an already stellar experience and expands upon almost every aspect that you know and love. A tad more enemy variety would have been nice but it’s hard to see <em>Star-Crossed World</em> as anything other than a must-play experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-review">TechRadar</a> kept the good times going with a 4.5/5 review, giving a shout-out to the creativity of the new levels and the performance boost — even if it believes the visual bump should have come for free:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The added areas in <em>Star Crossed World</em> are some of the best yet, and I’d wager playing the game without them would now make the game feel incomplete in some ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dropping down ever so slightly, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-star-crossed-world/">VGC</a> awarded the game a 4/5, with the outlet enjoying the 12 new stages, though conceding that none of them feel all that revolutionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The increase in resolution and switch to 60fps make it look and feel far more polished than before, and while the 12 new stages are essentially little more than an expansion pack, in this case more of the same thing isn't a negative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition-review/">TheGamer</a> offered a 4/5, giving particular praise to the new Mouthful Modes while wishing there were more of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 edition is the best way to play an already excellent 3D platformer that finally gives the pink protagonist the level of respect he deserves in the genre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review">IGN</a> pivoted a bit lower and awarded Kirby's latest a 7/10, with the review noting that the bonus stages are fun, but not much of a proper expansion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A couple of cool new enemies, funny Mouthful Mode transformations, and clever ideas put its 12 stages in the top half of the heap overall, but with little beyond that, this comes across less like a proper expansion and more like a DLC level pack to invite you to come back for a weekend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/08/27/kirby-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-review-extra-suck-24010224/">Metro</a> went with the same score and reviewed The Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World a 7/10, calling the bonuses fun but insignificant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is undoubtedly a superior version of Kirby And The Forgotten Land but the problem is that nothing it adds is of any particular significance and £17 is quite a lot for just four hours or so of entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of the ship, part of the crew</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hello Games is introducing the first major <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> update since the game launched on Switch 2, and it looks like a cool one.</p>
<p>The big new addition in the 'Voyagers' update is the chance to design and build your very own spaceship. These ships ('Corvettes') can be as big or as small as you'd like, with real interiors packing in med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters and more for you to waltz around even mid-flight.</p>
<p>To really hammer home the space captain vibes, you can bring aboard friends as your crew, letting them help with designs and travel across the universe with you. What's more, you can pop the hatch on your Corvette and head out for a space walk, gliding around your rig or hopping to another nearby ship.</p>
<p>For design inspiration purposes, here's a closer look at some of these Corvettes in action:</p>

<p>With so many additional moving parts (spaceships being redesigned while planets are rendered in the distance is no small task), we'll be interested to see how the little Switch version holds up. Fortunately, the beefier Switch 2 edition — which we described as "an almost-perfect match for other versions of the game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> — should offer a smoother ride.</p>
