<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33a1c78fb105b/jet-set-radio-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>.</p>
<p>Before we get cracking, let's see how things panned out last time, hm? We looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition</a> for the 3DS. North America and Europe joined forces on this one, and together, they managed to bag an impressive 72% of the vote. Well done, indeed.</p>
<p>This week, we're back with the Dreamcast to check out <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> (originally known as <strong>Jet Grind Radio</strong> in the US). Released in 2000, it went on to spawn a sequel and became one of the finest cult classics of the modern age, with an exceptional soundtrack to boot.</p>
<p>It's a full-on three-way brawl this week, so let's get to it!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:159585,160025 @ 1749987737 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/717ed2931d893/jet-set-radio-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All three cover designs showcase the main protagonist, Beat, front and centre. North America's approach is a little darker, overall, but the purple, red, and green work really well together.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14eb879dbb811/jet-set-radio-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe's design is a little bit lighter and brighter, potentially leaning into the overall theme of the Dreamcast itself. Beat's striking a pretty cool pose in this one, and we like that it makes the roller blade traversal obvious.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc2e7c9b41465/jet-set-radio-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Good lord, what's going on here? We love it! Very abstract. Beat is completely absent of any colour, and instead, the background is made up of lots of different graffiti images, with the main logo appearing just below Beat's spray can. So cool.</p>
<hr>

We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

<p>Get ready to "power-up" in Expeditions</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> has gone down quite well with LEGO and Fortnite fans, and Epic Games continues to enhance the experience with all sorts of new updates.</p>
<p>The latest reveal is a new teaser for <strong>LEGO Expeditions</strong>. Epic has released a trailer describing how players will suit up, squad up and power up next week on <strong>18th June</strong>, but beyond this, nothing else has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Fans are convinced it's going to lead into an "expanded universe" or even a "multiverse" style offering. It will follow on from modes like <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@epic/lego-fortnite-odyssey?lang=en-US">Lego Fortnite Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@epic/lego-fortnite-brick-life">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>. When we find out more about this new mode, we'll let you know.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-3" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite originally made its debut on the Switch in 2023 alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_racing">Rocket Racing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, and is Epic's way of expanding the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> universe. Epic also recently released a free Switch 2 version of Fortnite, and you can find out how LEGO Fortnite and the existing game modes run on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review</a>.</p>

<p>The famous Nintendo tune returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/281807c674aa4/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo mentioned how there were all sorts of surprises to discover in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and a week after the game's launch it looks like Totaka's Song has been discovered.</p>
<p>As highlighted on social media and elsewhere online (via Nintendo Everything), you can hear Yoshi humming this Nintendo tune in the game's character menu. Here's a story and video shared over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/">Mario Kart subreddit by the user 'charizardtelephone'</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was idling on the character select screen when I noticed Mario began humming after enough time passed. I thought, “Huh, they could totally hide hidden tunes like that.” Wait. Hidden music? In a Nintendo game? With Yoshi? It was too good to be true. But after a few seconds, lo and behold, yoshi begins humming Totaka’s song like the idle yoshis do in Mario Kart 8. Very cool Easter Egg. Not sure if anyone else has noticed it yet."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When we tried this out ourselves, Yoshi started humming the same song just seconds later. It might also be a bit harder to hear depending on the music playing in the background.</p>
<p>This famous song by the Japanese Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka is often slipped into many of company's games. And if you're wondering why it's specifically Yoshi that hums this tune, it's because Totaka also happens to be Yoshi's voice actor, and once again voices the character in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This Easter Egg has also popped up previously in Mario Kart 8 along with series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Zelda</a>, and was inserted into titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> back in the day.</p>

<p>Or are you an agent of chaos?</p>

<figure><a title="MARIO KART POLL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3effd655ac2fb/mario-kart-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have been wanting to ask a bunch of people this question for a while now, and it seems this is as good a time as any!</p>
<p>It's a question of gaming habits really, and how you approach doing things within them, that I'm sure holds up a mirror (mode) to our personalities in the 'real world' and all that, but I'm not a certified mind...person...so let's skip getting into anything deep.</p>
<p>No, best not. Anyway. I'm the sort of gamer who needs to stay organised, I'm also the kind of person who checks that doors are locked 50 times every night before bed. It therefore stands to reason that, when playing the likes of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> game, let's say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, since that's popular at the moment for some reason, I 100% <em>must</em> complete a cup to its fullest and shiniest gold-star level before racing the next one.</p>
<p>It is — or at least it feels as though it is — against any religion to skip forward though cups without first making sure I fully rinse the one I'm currently on. I just don't do it. Well, unless something is really frustrating me, then I <em>might</em>. Only might, mind.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs with most games I play. I can't leave a nook or cranny unexplored in open-world games (something that often puts me off them entirely) and I always feel the need to spend extra time milling about and trying to find everything before moving on - hence why Ubisoft-esque maps full of icons have the effect of making me need a 'wee lie down'.</p>
<p>So, I want to know, via the medium of a good old-fashioned poll, how many of you lot need to make sure you've done <em>everything</em> before moving on in Mario Kart's cups, and who is reckless? Who lives their lives like gaming anarchists, blasting through everything without a care in the world? You know. Having <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Let's get polling!</p>
