<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/058bf1d484435/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>The hugely-popular MMORPG <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> — which is about to celebrate its 12th anniversary (in its rebooted form) — is one of our most-requested Switch 2 ports, particularly from this writer. And it sounds like we're one step closer to seeing the game come to the hybrid console.</p>
<p>The game's director Naoki Yoshida — better known as Yoshi-P — has spoken to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">VGC</a> at Gamescom and confirmed that he and the team have been having "positive discussions" with Nintendo on the possibility of a port. Not only that, but he also wants to bring his other mainline Final Fantasy to the console, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>.</p>
<p>He told VGC "For me, it’s just my aim to provide Final Fantasy XIV and XVI to as many players as possible... We are putting in our best efforts to ensure that this happens, so it’s fine to convey to your readership that I consider the possibilities very positively."</p>
<p>The veteran producer acknowledges that the ability to play handheld, and on a console that's less powerful than a PS5 or PC, might make some aspects more difficult, such as high-level raids, “But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content."</p>

<p>In Final Fantasy XIV, there are a variety of jobs that are combat-focused, but there are also jobs that allow you to create gear, potions, cook food, and gather resources too. This content is more casual than your hardcore raiding or even running dungeons with randoms — though it's possible to go through many of the game's story dungeons with NPCs nowadays.</p>
<p>But, besides allowing players to go through the more chilled content on Switch 2, also excited about bringing the MMORPG to a new, potentially younger audience on the console.</p>
<p>With all of these aspects taken into consideration, Yoshi-P and the team "have been discussing with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/nintendo/" title="Platforms > Nintendo [5,512 articles]">Nintendo</a>, and the discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future.” We hope there's positive news on the horizon, too!</p>
<p>Yoshi-P has been fairly vocal about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-reiterates-interest-in-a-nintendo-release">getting FFXIV on a Nintendo console over the years</a>, but he's also a fan of the Big N's output himself. Earlier this year, he praised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/random-final-fantasy-14-director-thinks-aspiring-game-devs-should-play-echoes-of-wisdom">a must-play game for aspiring game developers</a>.</p>

The studio's next release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, looks to be no different, and a sighting and Gamescom confirms that the developer is going all in by including two of the least-popular MK games.</p>
<p>In a video posted originally on Twitter (now X), and since shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1mvg8d9/video_of_the_legacy_kollection_menu_ui/">Mortalkombatleaks subreddit</a> (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lwtovnr3y22f">Wario64</a>!), a list of games available on the collection is shown off, with two more titles revealing themselves at the bottom.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vxwign&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Those two games? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_mythologies_sub-zero">Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/mortal_kombat_special_forces">Mortal Kombat: Special Forces</a>. Not two particularly beloved games, if memory serves, but every single game deserves to be preserved, so we're really pleased to see them here.</p>
<p>After all, it wouldn't be a true history lesson or timeline if you simply covered all the cracks, and some people probably like these games.</p>

<p>Those unaware of these two Mortal Kombat spin-offs, let's take you through them. Mythologies: Sub-Zero launched on the N64 in 1997 (shortly after the PS1 release)and focuses on the elder Sub-Zero Bi-Han, who is on a quest to find Shinnok's amulet. Acting as a prequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a>, this isn't a traditional fighting game, it's a side-scroller with a little light platforming but similar controls to earlier MK games.</p>
<p>Special Forces was a PlayStation exclusive that came out in 2000 and, similarly to Sub-Zero, focuses on an individual character in Jax and is a completely different genre, a top-down action-adventure game. The game suffered from development issues and Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, along with others at Midway, left part-way through development.</p>
<p>We're sure to get an official announcement from Digital Eclipse or Atari pretty soon, but it doesn't look like these are the last additions to the game, either.</p>
<p>We already know the game is getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-gets-proper-physical-release-on-switch-2">a full physical release on Switch 2</a>, which is excellent news, so we hope we're getting an official release date, which hasn't been announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/whoops-it-looks-like-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollections-release-date-has-leaked-early">despite numerous leaks</a> over the weeks. Physical versions of the game are due to ship on 12th December 2025 from <a href="https://atari.com/products/mortal-kombat%E2%84%A2-legacy-kollection-kollector-s-edition?srsltid=AfmBOopf1xGy-lrFklNM_Vs698nW0Tx0EnGjF2hm5dYAHijvOa-2ABZF">Atari's store</a>.</p>
