<p>It's Tomba time (again)</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Limited Run Games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-limited-run-games-showcase-2024-every-switch-announcement-and-physical">announced</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_2_the_evil_swine_return_special_edition">Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return Special Edition</a> way back in June 2024, and while a good chunk of time has passed us by since then (including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/poll-tomba-special-edition-is-out-but-have-you-been-able-to-play-the-thing-on-switch">rather buggy</a> release of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_special_edition">platforming predecessor</a>), the release date is almost upon us!</p>
<p>Tomba 2 will arrive on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-2-the-evil-swine-return-special-edition-switch/">Switch eShop</a> on <strong>15th December</strong> for <strong>$19.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), marking the first time that the 3D PlayStation platformer has been available on Nintendo systems.</p>
<p>For those who didn't try this one out in the early 2000s, Tomba 2 took the same jungle platforming precedent as the first game in the series, but moved things into the wonderful world of 3D. With the now-chiselled Tomba given an extra dimension to play with, the game packed in new weapons and power-up costumes on top of a huge number of fresh missions and events.</p>
<p>This Switch 'Special Edition' throws in a museum gallery mode, <em>and</em> the chance to rewind and save at any time, so while the polygonal visuals remain, there are at least some ways to get around the game's less favourable nostalgic elements.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the new release's key features and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• Gorgeous 3D graphics that instantly transport you to Tomba's world<br>
• All new weapons, items and costumes to collect and use against the Evil Pigs<br>
• A massive 137 different missions to complete<br>
• New exclusive features such as rewind and save anywhere<br>
• A museum filled with rare artwork and much more</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the original Tomba would go on to be a perfectly acceptable slice of throwback platforming on Switch, it launched in such a state that some of us found it essentially unplayable on the hybrid console. Let's hope that things get off to a smoother start with its sequel.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d891c00a7cd74"><a title="xc2 8th birthday" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d891c00a7cd74/xc2-8th-birthday.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Monolith Soft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Has it really been eight entire years? Yes, it really actually has, so sit up and pay attention at the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a>, which as every <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">Xenoblade</a> nerd worth their salt knows is actually the third game released in the series, dropped into existence on this very day back in 2017, and it's a bit good. We gave it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">well-deserved 9/10</a> in our review, so it's a bona fide banger as officially ordained by the bona fide banger squad™.</p>
<p>To celebrate this eighth birthday (they get big so quickly these days), Monolith Soft has been sharing a lovely bit of artwork over on its social media. Which is great.</p>

<p>For reference, here's the Google translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On this day in 2017, "Xenoblade 2" was released.<br>
#MonolithSoft's Development History #WhatDayIsItToday<a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/games/"><br>
https://monolithsoft.co.jp/games/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, happy birthday. Very good. Now *pulls out ice-cream machine gun* make with the Switch 2 version, wiseguys. Come on. Open your jackets, show us the goods. Where is it?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems this writer's dream of an all-new, 60fps, 4K, enhanced-graphics, 100%-more-volumetrics-version of XC2 especially for Switch 2 might have to wait just a little bit longer. Unless they drop it later today (there's still time!).</p>
<p>Indeed, as much as we're just having a bit of birthday banter, it <em>has</em> been something that's been asked for repeatedly and rather loudly from franchise fans since Nintendo's new console dropped. With so many games getting boosts from the Switch 2, you may have hoped this epic action-RPG might have brute-forced itself into a better situation, even without an official upgrade.</p>
<p>However, unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>, and a whole bunch of other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/33-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">games that got nice free boosts on the Switch 2</a>, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, whilst a little more stable in its 30fps now, still suffers from issues and hasn't benefited in any meaningful way. It's still a gorgeous, absolutely must-play thing, make no mistake, but it feels like it could be more.</p>

<p>This is a series, too, that really does tend to sing extra-specially loudly when it's unshackled from any technical limitations. We've all seen how improved the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">first game</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> have been in their revamped, Definitive forms. So it stands to reason that we're all chomping at the bit to see Alrest and the Driver of the Aegis looking and feeling their best in a Switch 2 upgrade of some sort.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime, happy 8th birthday, Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Enjoy your day. Just don't come down here dressed like that for your 10th.</p>
