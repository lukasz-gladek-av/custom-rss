<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> is out now on Switch and Switch 2, and we thought it was really rather good. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">9/10 review of the Switch 1 version</a>, we said it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well," praising the sheer amount of compelling stuff to do alongside the "edgy and dramatic" story.</p>
<p>The kind folks over at Marvelous have sent us the physical Limited Edition of the Switch 1 game to check out, and we thought you might like to see exactly what's included in this edition. So we've put together a cheeky little gallery to peruse at your leisure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wlsqhn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>What's included, exactly? Well, the star of the show is a rather beautiful Sacred Fan with an accompanying clear display stand. You've also got a Woolby Plush Keychain, a 161-page softback art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD, and the game itself on cartridge.</p>
<p>Definitely some high-quality goodies, and we're particularly enamoured with the art book – it's chock-full of character designs and environment paintings. Gorgeous stuff. Let's take a closer look.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition is still available and priced at <strong>£79.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US (if you can find one). A proper physical edition for the Switch 2 (i.e. not a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a>) is also available for <strong>£59.99 / $69.99</strong> (or alternatively you can opt for the upgrade pack for <strong>£10 / $10</strong> if you already have the Switch 1 version).</p>
<p><em>Huge thanks to Marvelous for sending us a sample to check out. Have you tried Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma on Switch or Switch 2 yet? Are you tempted to grab a copy of the Limited Edition? Let us know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p>

<p>She ain't no Odd Rock</p>

<figure><a title="DK Bananza 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e21dc5f3ea534/dk-bananza-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Direct</a> from Nintendo revealed that DK's new companion, Odd Rock, isn't actually Odd Rock at all, but rather a young Pauline. Gasp!</p>
<p>We all kind of knew this was coming, of course, thanks to a previous leak, but it's still pretty cool to see just how vital she'll prove to be with the overarching story.</p>
<p>Thanks to a new page via the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Store</a>, even more details regarding Pauline have been revealed, including her age. According to a very brief summary of her character, she is 13 years old at the time she encounters DK in Bananza.</p>
<p>Translated via Google, the sumary reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A 13-year-old girl who loves to sing. She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and turned into a rock."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Pauline - DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fdc75f17bb9a/pauline-dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Direct revealed that Pauline can use her singing abilities to point DK in the right direction during gameplay, while also transforming him into one of three new forms: Kong Bananza, Zebra Bananza, and Ostrich Bananza.</p>
<p>Co-op play is also supported, with a second player taking on the role of Pauline to sing out deadly words to defeat enemies and blast away chunks of the environment. GameShare has also been confirmed for DK Bananza, with users of Switch 1 consoles able to join the fun.</p>

<figure><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6751a32c7063/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo released a bunch of free Switch updates alongside the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this month but one issue that wasn't entirely resolved was tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Nintendo was only able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2-updates-for-multiple-first-party-switch-games-are-now-available">"partially" alleviate an issue</a> which occured when playing the game on the Switch 2, and the "entire screen" would flicker in several scenes. It mentioned in the previous patch notes how a fix was on the way, and today it's seemingly delivered on this promise with the Version 1.1.3 game update:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 3 Deluxe: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released June 16, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurs when playing on Nintendo Switch 2 where the entire screen will briefly turn off and on again in several scenes of the game, such as at the beginning and end of a day.</li>
<li>Several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how this particular problem has <em>not</em> been resolved in the Pikmin 3 Deluxe Demo, but a fix for this will be distributed alongside a full game update at some point in the future.</p>
<p>These are the only updates Pikmin 3 Deluxe has received for the Switch 2 so far and if there are any upgrades released, we'll let you know. Pikmin 3 is marked on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility list of games</a> with issues that have "been resolved, or are planned to be resolved by an update".</p>
<p>This follows on from an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
