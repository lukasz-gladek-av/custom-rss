<figure><a title="MvC: Fighting Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/943fe902c6a0b/mvc-fighting-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> has sold a total of 1 million copies since its launch in September 2024 (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collections-impressive-sales-show-fans-are-hungry-for-more">Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>Announced via social media, the translated post reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection global sales surpass 1 million copies!</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you, we have achieved global sales of 1 million copies!</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued support for this title!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's an impressive result for Capcom, but it seems almost guaranteed that we won't get a brand new entry in the series – at least not any time soon.</p>
<p>The reason for this, of course, is that Marvel is now collaborating with Sony on the new PS5 / PC title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, with acclaimed developer Arc System Works (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>) at the helm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6ePAJ6dxYWY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea9qnxvgw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePAJ6dxYWY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's not out of the question that we might see a new MvC in the future, but with Marvel Tōkon launching in 2026, we reckon Capcom might be more inclined to create a new entry in the Capcom vs. SNK series.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a> director Hideaki Itsuno recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/capcom-vs-snk-2-director-really-wants-to-make-a-third-entry">stated his desire to make a third game</a>, and said he would do so if Capcom and SNK licensed it to his new studio, Lightspeed Japan Studio.</p>

<p>The cherry on top</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Bellhart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7a01c3a6dd90/hollow-knight-silksong-bellhart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> just got its first post-release patch last week — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-upcoming-patch-will-nerf-the-difficulty-in-certain-areas">one which actually nerfed the difficulty of a few early game bosses</a> — but Team Cherry is almost ready to put out a second one.</p>
<p>This time around, however, it's all about bug fixes (haaa...) and tweaks to Tools. Sharing the details on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">Steam</a>, the developer has detailed what these entail, with many of them focusing on enemies accidentally going out-of-bounds and certain Tools not doing the right amount of damage or not working as intended.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ohyixl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While fans should "Expect a few more additions and tweaks before full release", for now, it looks like this patch will be forgoing any more difficulty tweaks. That's not to say Team Cherry won't add any more later down the line, of course, but for now, things are staying as they are.</p>
<p>Currently, there's not a release date for the patch, but we imagine it'll drop in the next week or two.</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">current patch notes</a>:</p>
<h3>Patch Notes</h3>
