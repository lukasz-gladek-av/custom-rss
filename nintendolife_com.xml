<p>"More than 100 staff without jobs"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Romero Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62cb7c5b0b801/romero-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd">@romerogamesltd</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been another tough week for the video game industry and the fallout from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-hit-with-layoffs-following-microsoft-xbox-cuts">Microsoft's layoffs led to funding cuts</a> at John and Brenda Romero's studio, Romero Games.</p>
<p>Now, following some claims the studio had completely shut its doors, Irish publication The Journal has got apparently got an official confirmation about this in a statement from Brenda Romero (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-shuttered-and-over-100-staff-axed-after-xbox-pulls-funding">thanks, Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>It's mentioned how the decision was made at a "high level" within Microsoft and well above the studio's own "visibility and control".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time...We’re heartbroken that it’s come to this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romero Games reportedly employed 42 studio members "directly", with its broader network for its latest project at "more than 100" people.</p>
<p>An "anonymous" staff member of the Galway-based studio told the source it's been a "big shock" as the team had only had meetings with its publisher the "day before this happened". There was also apparently no warning, and it's further claimed there are "no remaining funds to continue operations".</p>
<p>John Romero was one of the co-creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>, and the studio he co-founded with his wife went on to release multiple titles including the strategy RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/empire_of_sin">Empire of Sin</a> for the Switch in 2020. The same developer also released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/doom-plus-doom-ii-switch-update-3-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">SIGIL and SIGIL 2</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>

<p>While it might not be the launch title <em>everyone</em> was hoping for, it's still packed with plenty of things to do. This includes a new Knockout Tour mode, a whole world to free roam, and plenty of classic options like Grand Prix, local and online multiplayer, Time Trials, and Battle Mode.</p>
<p>So, how much time have you spent in Mario Kart World so far? What mode have you played the most and what would you rate the game now that you've had an entire month with it (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">and after that recent patch</a>)? Let us know by voting in our poll:</p>

<p>If you still haven't played Mario Kart World, or aren't sure if it's the right game for you, you can check out our Nintendo Life review. We said the title was the perfect introduction to Nintendo's new console generation, awarding it an "excellent" score.</p>

<p>Who needs an OLED TV when you have a widescreen CRT TV?</p>
<p>Okay, genuinely, CRT scanlines are gorgeous and we have a huge soft spot for these chunky units. Sitting on the floor, looking up at the screen as we ran around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a>; pure bliss.</p>
<p>The Switch 2, with its 120fps capabilities and VRR in handheld, is a much more powerful console than the N64 (duh!). So why on earth would we want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> on a 27 inch CRT TV?</p>
<p>Well, our lovely video producer Zion is here to show you just what playing a Switch 2 on a CRT TV is like, and honestly? It's magical. From newer titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> to retro indie throwbacks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, Zion's running down the wonderful nostalgia of playing games on an old TV.</p>
<p>Is it the <em>best</em> way to play the Switch 2? No way. Is it fascinating? Heck yes. It takes a fair bit of set-up and it'll vary depending on what kind of TV you have, but if you're interested, check out Zion's video up top and let us know in the comments whether you want to try this out</p>

<p>But new catches, new games, and a new studio are in the net</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Dredge" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c2c5ca2c7e18/dredge.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team17</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lovecraftian fishing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> was a hit back in 2023, blending unsettling horror and sea creatures with atmospheric storytelling and some good ol' reeling in. Now, after some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/reminder-dredges-new-expansion-update-the-iron-rig-is-out-now">paid DLC</a> and free updates, the New Zealand-based developer is ready to move on from the seas and create something brand new — and "No, it's not Dredge 2".</p>
<p>Sharing the news on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blacksaltgames.com/post/3lt3r7344a22o">Bluesky</a>, the team's next title will be an open-world RPG in a new world and setting. It'll still be dark, of course, but it's something <em>very</em> different from the studio's first shipment.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ivnuzh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But that's not the only new announcement; Black Salt has expanded and opened up a second development studio, called Disc 2 Games. "Think bright, colourful and 90's retro!" says the announcement post. Oh, <em>we're thinking, all right.</em></p>

<p>“We’ve taken DREDGE as far as we can technically – especially while continuing to support players on previous-gen consoles,” producer and CEO of Disc 2 Nadia Thorne shared in <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/Black-Salt-Games-Announces-New-Studio-and-Next-Projects">a press release</a>. The studio is eager to "turn our attention to something new” and move on.</p>
<p>Programmer and writer at Black Salt Games Joel Mason echoes Thorne's sentiments, saying "It's reaffirming to know that players enjoy the types of worlds that we want to create - and gives us the confidence to try to do it again."</p>
<p>In terms of Disc 2, the studio has apparently been working on their debut game "for a bit over a year now" says technical director Kris Nicholson. And, despite the proposed colourful facade of the upcoming game, creative director Johannes Otte is setting our expectations appropriately; "beneath this polished surface lies a gritty world, waiting for players to immerse themselves in and join our characters in rebelling against.”</p>
<p>This is fantastic news to read in an industry that feels like it's collapsing in on itself sometimes, and we can't wait to see more from both studios.</p>

<p>No one could USB-C this...</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 and Switch 2 USB-C" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75ab9eb41aa1c/switch-1-and-switch-2-usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the launch of the Switch 2, accessory manufacturers have been rushing to bring their products to the market in a bid to offer alternatives to Nintendo's own set, including docks. The latter has been causing headaches for many, and it seems Nintendo has put in place restrictions on the console's USB-C ports.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">The Verge's Sean Hollister</a> has been looking into the Switch 2's USB-C port and was told this was the case after speaking to two accessory manufacturers. What should happen is that, when the console is popped into a dock via the USB-C adapter, it kicks off a series of commands that allow the power supply/dock to output video. That's an <em>extremely</em> oversimplified explanation. That's not happening when you connect the Switch 2 to most third-party docks, however.</p>
<p>According to The Verge's sources, the Switch 2 uses a new kind of dedicated encryption chip and scheme and, upon testing, Hollister saw (as he puts it) "the new Nintendo Switch not behaving like a good USB citizen should".</p>
<p>As a result, companies like Jsaux have told The Verge that it's halted plans to make a Switch 2 dock because they simply can't get around the problem right now. Hollister has found some docks that work so far — the <strong>SIWIQU for Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Station</strong>, AverMedia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwdSkzN7Iw&amp;ab_channel=AVerMediaContentCreators">own dock</a>, and Viture's virtual glasses hub.</p>
<p>Others on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lmbroo/siwiqu_antank_s3_max_dock_works_perfectly/">NintendoSwitch2 subreddit</a> say the same thing about the SIWIQU, but there's understandable caution when very few <em>actually</em> work, and when early Switch 1 docks also caused problems.</p>

<p>Manufacturers expect Nintendo will try to "maintain device and system security" via updates, and the Switch 2 does have extra fans — including a fan in the dock itself — as the console runs a little hotter than the Switch 1. It may well be that there's something in Nintendo's upscaling tech that's causing issues with other docks. Or, it could just be that Nintendo is trying to prevent any potential issues that may be caused by unofficial docks.</p>
<p>It's a more powerful dock all around, and it does much more than the Switch 1's ever did. So it looks like this will be an ongoing battle, though we're sure that we'll see plenty of third-party options pop up in the future.</p>

The first one is out today, and it's utterly adorable.</p>
<p>Shared by <a href="https://www.serebii.net/anime/other/morpeko'sfirstouting.shtml">Serebii</a>, <strong>Morpeko's First Outing</strong> is the first episode of a new series called <strong>Pokémon Summer Stories</strong>, which we can only imagine are cute little adventures focusing on the fun of the summer holiday season. With added Pokémon, of course.</p>
<p>This episode focuses on Shota and his companion Morpeko. Shota joins up with his friends Haru and Takeru, who are all heading to a beach festival to see the Pokémon Bisharp. You can watch the whole 11 minute episode below.</p>
<p>While it's currently only in Japanese right now, that doesn't stop us admiring the lovely animation style and seeing some of our favourite Pokémon looking brighter and more-colourful than ever. Hopefully, as more episodes come out, they'll get an English dub (or subs!).</p>

<p>Pokémon is, of course, no stranger to animation, and there are a few exciting projects coming up for the multimedia franchise. <strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Concierge</strong> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/netflix-confirms-new-episodes-of-pokemon-concierge-are-on-the-way">set to return to Netflix with brand new episodes</a> in the future, and British stop-motion animation studio <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/pokemon-announces-collaboration-with-wallace-and-gromit-studio">Aardman are currently working with TPC on a "project'</a>.</p>
