<p>Silver Lining Interactive has announced that a physical edition of its first-person survival horror sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bendy_and_the_dark_revival">Bendy and the Dark Revival</a>, releases today for Switch . Hooray! (And/or terrified gasps!)</p>
<p>The physical edition of Bendy and the Dark Revival is out <strong>today, and you can pick it up from</strong> <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/products/bendy-and-the-dark-revival-standard-edition-nintendo-switch?_pos=2&amp;_sid=8fc22cb6c&amp;_ss=r">Silver Lining Direct for £32.99</a> or whatever that equates to where you are.</p>
<p>This particular survival horror, which is currently sat on a very respectable <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/bendy-and-the-dark-revival/">72% over on ye olde Metacritic</a>, sees players assume the role of Audrey, "a trapped animator who must navigate a dark, ink-drenched version of her old studio."</p>
<p>You solve puzzles and face off against scary enemies in this inky horror adventure. Will Audrey be able to survive for long enough? It's up to us! Gulp.</p>
<p>Here's some more official deets on the game, including some screenshots, in case you missed it early this year::</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Fight for Survival<br></strong>Sneak, fight, and think your way through a nightmare made real. Use stealth and puzzle-solving to avoid deadly encounters, or face them head-on with evolving inky powers.</p>
<p><strong>Terrifying Foes<br></strong>Face horrifying creatures lurking in the shadows, each more grotesque and relentless than the last. And always, the Ink Demon watches…</p>
<p><strong>A Story Drenched in Mystery<br></strong>Dive into a dark tale where animation and reality collide. Uncover lost secrets, piece together Audrey’s past, and make your way out. If escape is even possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While we missed out on this one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">we did review</a> the game's predecessor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">Bendy And The Ink Machine</a>, which we thought was solid, but lost its magic towards the end.</p>

<p>If you're excited to dive deep into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a> on 30th October, well, you'll be able to do that quite literally, as Square Enix has shown off a brand new region, added to Dragon Quest II specifically, in this remake (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-details-new-content-seabed">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>The Seabed is (as you'd expect) an underwater region that you'll be able to access as soon as you get the boat. And it's here where you'll meet the merfolk, who live in the aptly-named Mersea. But there's no time to relax, as they're being threatened by monsters.</p>
<p>There are new dungeons and enemies to encounter, including Mariella, who is one of Hargon's (the big bad, in case you're new to DQII) Champions.</p>
<p>New story content will also be part of this new region; yesterday, during the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/roundup-all-the-reveals-from-the-xbox-showcase-at-tokyo-game-show-2025">Xbox Tokyo Game Show Showcase</a>, producer Haysaka Masaaki shared a small snippet of gameplay from the Seabed, which you can watch up-top.</p>


<p>We've been getting a lot of DQ I&amp;II news lately, which makes sense given that the game is out next month. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-trailer-showcases-the-remakes-fresh-features">Square Enix gave us a little peak at some other new content</a>, and this is where the Seabed was last teased. It was also shown off briefly during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x60H0alsB5w">Nintendo Direct on 12th September in Japan</a>.</p>
