<p>Excuse me?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We reported on Bandai Namco's naughty pup simulator, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doronko_wanko">Doronko Wanko</a>, back in December of last year, and not just because we were worried about what exactly this particular canine might be up to.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this very bold, but very cute, little doggy — who's name actually derives from <strong>わんこ</strong> <strong>Wan ko</strong>, which is an informal or cute way of saying dog or puppy in Japanese — is into wrecking the place, messing up his owner's stuff and causing havoc. Suddenly we are very, very interested.</p>
<p>The game, which is free-to-play on Steam (where it's currently sat on an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512840/DORONKO_WANKO/">"Overwhelmingly Positive" user-rating</a>) does cost $4.99 for Switch consoles. Boo! It's also launching alongside a bunch of new DLC that adds new breeds and kennels to muck about with. Hooray!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're into roleplaying a canine character who likes to destroy nice rooms with juice and ketchup, and just generally be a very bad dog, we're sure the price barrier to entry is unlikely to stop you in your messy, bold pup tracks. It's just one of those very specific things.</p>
<figure><a title="Doronko Wanko" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91ce434669ac/doronko-wanko.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the game up top, and here's some more details for those dawgs over at Bandai Namco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who’s a good boy? Whoseagoodboyyy? You are! Yes you are! So fluffy, so obedient, so swee—WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE HOUSE!?” Terrorize master’s domain with five new adorable-yet-troublemaking breeds as Corgis, Shibas, Jack Russell Terriers, Bulldogs, and Toy Poodles join the mess-making mix.</p>
<p>Fling muck onto every surface: spill wine bottles on the floor, splash paint on the walls, and shake grime from the pupper's filthy fur onto nearby furniture. It’s not all about destruction — haul scattered toys back to their rightful rooms (good dog!) to unlock new items, areas, and mess-making capabilities (bad dog!).</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Double the disarray with the assistance of rogue robo-vacuums and spinning fans that can spread dirt farther than those tiny paws could ever reach. Can these playful pups get any cuter? Yestheycanohmygoodness! Put on precious pirate hats or angelic halos — because they’re innocent!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DORONKO WANKO is now available for <a href="https://stridepr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/25YVWJhkzFCDWhgLPbt6YofXHpuPutNLujZn-5bPf-pngGeM8mAH4t14off9XzvI0aWlZaB18J1GBS5wLmTq_k4kUvs1-swhIBLEwuOwDwEJq3nNWMAMlLKHI-NOqkZDTH_Ra9mFNRLtfMd3YpTXJAfeRQnFRuZPfGfJ7CrQ6-ruTur61PZm7B9lQy2K_tv79NtLu8x989QFf4TyxfByseazx8fTJNHGLde6JDc1G0mVer8kNdqnOwpl7s9tnxqsxUDqskb6HxvAUpJQj-EwtMWsKzL2HE03M8TIEHA">Nintendo Switch</a> for $4.99</p>

<p>For trainers located in Japan and Australia</p>

<figure><a title="Pokemon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab368ab488c3a/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: via Serebii.net / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been an exciting week on the Pokémon front with multiple new announcements shared in the recent broadcast. Following this, more details about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> physical and digital pre-order goodies in select regions have been surfacing online.</p>
<p>Now, we've got an update about one of the special items trainers located in Japan and Australia can get their hands on as a pre-order bonus. As highlighted by Serebii.net, it's a trench coat customisation and will be available "at certain locations" – including Amazon in Japan and from EB Games in Australia.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The same source also notes how this bonus will be distributed as a "serial code to redeem" but has no further details about additional distributions elsewhere. So, if you do decide to pre-order, you'll be able to look the part with this stylish and exclusive fit as you make your way around Lumiose City.</p>
<p>This again follows The Pokémon Company and Nintendo announcing a new Switch 2 hardware bundle this week as well as multiple pre-order deals. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-and-switch-pre-order-bonuses-revealed-us">some other digital distribution pre-order offers</a>, and these particular ones are available worldwide.</p>
<p>You can find out more about these pre-order bonuses in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumours about a Nintendo Direct</a> already doing the rounds online, veteran video game journalist Christopher Dring has now added to this buzz, claiming "Xbox is expected to announce more game ports" for other platforms, including the Switch 2, in the "coming weeks" (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-apparently-announce-more-ps5-and-switch-2-ports-in-the-coming-weeks">thanks, Pure Xbox</a>).</p>
<p>This would follow Activision's recent release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> on Nintendo's new hardware, with this publisher (also known for series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a>) now owned by Microsoft.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While it's not known what exactly we might be seeing on the Switch 2 from Xbox, there's already been a lot of rumours about key series potentially being ported.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> team has recently responded to a question from <a href="https://youtu.be/o5tOD0sqfKM?t=1050">Gamertag Radio</a> about the game's sequel potentially getting a Switch 2 release at some point, and it sounds open to the idea of it – mentioning how it wants "as many people to be able to play" as possible (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51091-obsidian-says-we-ll-see-what-happens-in-regards-to-grounded-2-on-switch-2">via GoNintendo</a>).</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Xbox has been releasing more of its IP on other platforms, with <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a></strong> coming to the PlayStation 5 next month.</p>
