<figure><a title="Metroid II Samus Death" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1aef3c12c3ab/metroid-ii-samus-death.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I recently started playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> for the first time. I’m not sure why. Maybe it was a way of staving off my intense cravings for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which as of writing still doesn’t have a launch date more concrete than the vague '2025' window Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/nintendo-highlights-multiple-switch-games-launching-in-2025">over a year ago</a>. In any case, Metroid II impressed me almost immediately, but it wasn’t until I saw heroine Samus Aran die that I realised just how unique it is in relation to the rest of the series.</p>
<p>While the video game industry places a lot of importance on the benefits of more powerful hardware, developers can also do incredible things when presented with limitations. Metroid II, released in North America in late 1991 before making its way to Japan and Europe the following year, is a great example of this phenomenon. The changes made to ensure the nascent Metroid formula was readable on the Game Boy’s small, colourless screen resulted in a handheld adventure still praised today for its austere atmosphere.</p>
<p>Metroid II is claustrophobic, at least when compared to its predecessor on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The rooms in both games may not be much different in size, but the portable sequel focuses so closely on Samus that it often feels as if there’s barely any space to navigate its tunnels and passageways. Metroid II’s perspective shift, combined with its story about genociding the series’ eponymous parasites, makes for a game that’s dark and oppressive while still managing to feel like a natural next step in what, at the time, was a young franchise.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Power Metroid II" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f216abb657df/nintendo-power-metroid-ii.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first few hours with Metroid II were uneventful. I messed around with the controls and acclimated to the grayscale environments of the Metroid homeworld before settling in to Samus’ mission of extermination. As these things often go, I soon found myself low on health courtesy of the planet’s dangerous inhabitants. I scrambled to reach a previous save point to avoid losing several precious minutes of progress, but eventually my reserve energy tanks hit zero after taking too many hits. And that’s when Samus surprised me by simply… fading away.</p>
<p>I’ve grown accustomed to one of two things happening when you die in a Metroid game. The first, seen in almost every other 2D instalment, is that Samus and her suit will explode into several pieces. The second – and infinitely more traumatic, at least in the case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> – is watching Samus’ visor blink out from a first-person point of view and then being treated to the sounds of her heart flatlining and/or the image of blood spreading slowly across the game over screen. Dying is climactic and every game in the series makes it feel important.</p>
<p>Well, every game except Metroid II, of course. As shown in the video below, Samus doesn't explode, and the game over screen is nothing more than white text on a black screen. She just ceases to exist, the hundreds of pixels that make up her sprite disappearing line by line until nothing is left. The game leads us to believe Samus is the only person capable of eliminating the Metroid threat, but it treats her defeat with hardly any reverence at all.</p>

<p>The observable universe is calculated to be a region of <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/how-big-universe">about 410 nonillion cubic light-years</a> potentially containing as many habitable planets <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/the-milky-way-is-flush-with-habitable-planets-study-says">as there are grains of sand</a> on all of Earth’s beaches, and that’s just what we can see with current technology. Reality itself <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/is-the-universe-infinite">could very well be infinite</a>. Sure, our limited perspective may make us feel like we’re all there is, but in the grand scheme of things, what impact does the life of any one person truly have on the universe as a whole? If a global population of <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population">over 8.2 billion people</a> amounts to just a drop in the universal bucket, then the death of a single bounty hunter — or even a handful of space jellyfish — is so cosmically insignificant, it may as well have not happened at all.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say if Nintendo intended to impart this kind of existential crisis with Metroid II. Maybe the developers struggled with translating the death animation from the previous game onto the Game Boy screen and felt a short fade-out would be enough to convey Samus’ demise. Metroid II may seem like an outlier when compared to the rest of the franchise thanks to the perspective provided by the intervening decades, but at the time of its release, it was just the second game in the series. Aspects of the Metroid formula we take for granted today were still being hammered out. It’s entirely possible I’m placing too much importance on a three-second animation.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid: Samus Returns" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98efe4f1c9c12/metroid-samus-returns.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Samus' fade-out was one of many details addressed in the remake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_samus_returns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a>, but I think I prefer the original's more unsettling approach. — <em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But isn’t that what’s great about art? It allows us to go deep on topics that may seem thin on paper but touch us in meaningful ways. A small team at Nintendo made a relatively minor decision about what happens when the player dies, and almost 34 years later, it’s making me think about my place in the universe.</p>
<p>Even today, Metroid II is a crowning achievement, equal parts compelling in its presentation and impressive in how it manages to provide a sprawling adventure on the first-generation Game Boy. Its utter indifference towards Samus Aran relegates her to an insignificance that stands in stark contrast to the almost godlike figure she’s become in modern instalments. While the rest of the series often turns Samus’ death into the kind of spectacle reserved for fallen heroes, Metroid II instead reflects our own vast, unfeeling universe with what amounts to a shrug. We all just fade away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157868/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>There's usually a number of a certain type of game that drops when a brand new console arrives on the scene. You know the ones, the quirky ones, the ones that utilise new tech and features — such as the Switch 2's camera and game-sharing abilities — to give us something we haven't seen before.</p>
<p>And so it is that we come to be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, one of these very sorts of early-gen experiences, this time one that's centred around using GameShare (although you can also play solo) to effectively sit around an outdoor fire pit and shoot the proverbial. You know, catch up on old times with your pals. And with GameShare, you only need one copy to then have up to four people in total involved in the fun. So, for the price of $14.99 / £13.49, even though it's a slim affair, you can maximise your value by having other folk who're willing to get involved.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157869/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>But involved in what exactly, you buffoon?</em> I hear you ask. Well, besides sitting at the fire, you can walk around a small space to gather up wood to keep the flames going, a puzzle game in itself, and there are a few different places to unlock and camp at.</p>
<p>In fact, chillin' isn't necessarily a thing you'll do a lot of early doors, as you get used to finding, chopping, and chucking wood into the fire. As a professional gamer, of course, I'm a naturally panicky person outdoors, so there was a little settling-in time before I realised that you don't really need to sweat the technique, as they say, when it comes to your fire. Not in the normal mode at least.</p>
<p>So, your aim then is to keep the fire burning, sometimes for a specific amount of time, even, and you've got a hatchet and some tongs for picking up and chopping wood into various sizes on your chopping stump. Small is good for getting things started, etc.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157867/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You've also got a wind blower, which any self-respecting fire...eh...firemaker professional will know exactly what to do with. Besides this, you also get an infinite supply of marshmallows to toast. And let me tell you something, my camping cousins, I've burned about 1,000 of these tasty treats trying to nail it, so there's definitely 'game' to be had here for anyone who thinks it's a walking sim.</p>
<p>There's then a puzzle aspect introduced as you unlock survival/challenge versions of the various camp spots the game has to offer. Now you'll need to stack things just so and do your best <em>a little better</em> as the game gives you other things, like wind, to consider. Have you ever considered wind?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna just spoil everything — it's all still very chill, make no mistake — but there's more to do here than you might expect, basically. To this end, there are also a lot of things to tick off, with in-built achievements for doing certain things in certain ways that'll keep interested parties busy for a while.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157873/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In multiplayer, you can choose to have your camera and/or mic turned on or off, and the game will show you a little circular video feed of your pal(s) that moves around to collect wood or sit at the fireside. It's funny, cute, and amusing enough for a time. This mode also introduces the ability to converse, of course. While sitting and chatting (and, indeed, chillin') by the fire, if you're having trouble with topics — we can't all be natural lily-guilders — the game will provide them on the fly, with just a press down on the D-pad giving you some random things to think on at any given time.</p>
<p>Beyond lots of cheevos built in, you can also spend camping points (yes, I'm being serious, what of it?) on customising your gear. So you can have a silly-looking hatchet or what have you, or a magic wand. Knock yourself out, mate, it's all good with me. I have my own kinks to think about.</p>
<p>Now, it's fairly hard to review a game like this, in all honesty, because your mileage is going to vary massively. There isn't a whole lot to do here, and the slow movement of the camera and very small areas make it all feel a little turgid and rigid for an experience that's meant to be about relaxing outside. So there's a negative. Also, in related news, there's no way to change your control layout, which is gonna be a shame for any of your squad who can't do the default layout, for whatever reason.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157871/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>However! On a more positive note, if you have family or friends in remote locations, or you want to (re)connect with people in a new way, it works fine. A game with Nintendo Life's video legend, Felix, and I'm convinced that the tech is sound and you can see and chat to friends with very little effort expended.</p>
<p>Beyond those who want to use it socially, though? I'm not sure it has any legs. The core is just too shallow and simple, and I'm left wondering if this sort of thing wouldn't work better as part of a compendium of similar social efforts that utilise the tech in cool ways. As a standalone thing, it's sort of hard to justify, even at a reduced price, although it isn't completely without merit.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Certainly a novel way to connect with pals, and not without merit in its relaxing blend of gathering wood and testing yourself to keep the fire burning, Chillin' By The Fire has its positives. The GameShare aspects, when playing with friends, work well and are easy to set up, and it's nice to be able to buy one copy and then invite folk along. I also enjoyed the light puzzling for a time as I worked to keep my fire alive.</p>
<p>However, beyond these basic aspects and some achievements, and especially for solo players, there's not much else here.</p></section>
