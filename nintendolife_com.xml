<p>Alo there</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Super Evil Megacorp has continued to support its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>-inspired roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_splintered_fate">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</a>, ever since it first arrived on Switch back in 2024. We've already seen new fighters and game modes get in on the action since launch, and today, the team has revealed that it has even more in store for 2026.</p>
<p>Splintered Fate's first DLC of the year is out right now, adding the assassin mutant fox, Alopex, as a playable character. This newbie looks like a pretty nimble fighter, packing a punch at close range with her kama main weapon and dealing explosive damage with throwable kunai.</p>
<p>The paid DLC also includes five new artifacts, letting you add extra modifiers to your runs. Here's a list of each of them, and a brief description of what they're all about:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Polar Bear Netsuke</em>- Every 10 seconds, Final Strike will throw out a line of flames. Cooldown is halved under half health.</li>
<li><em>The Maltese Hamster</em> - Your Tool charges slower, but deals extra Damage.</li>
<li><em>Channel Six Mini Camera</em> - Your Special charges slower, but deals extra damage.</li>
<li><em>Hot Cocoa (with Marshmallows)</em> - You have -1 dash. When you dash, gain a burst of movement speed.</li>
<li><em>Buddy the Wraith</em> - You have an allied Utrom Wraith, which levels up and evolves over a run</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not all paid extras, mind you. The dev has also released a free update today, which adds four challenging new 'Pepper Runs' to Arcade Mode, a Ninja Ranks prestige system, new combat rooms in the main campaign's Sewers, Docks, Streets, and Rooftops locales, and a slew of balancing tweaks.</p>
<p>It all adds to a game which, while perfectly fun at launch, always felt like it was sitting in Hades' shadow. "Despite the power of the IP and a co-op addition," we said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate">our review</a>, "it doesn't pack enough of a punch to avoid unfavourable comparisons to Supergiant's classic and constantly feels like it's on the back foot because of it".</p>

<p>"I feel like GameChat was made just for Resident Evil'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a new Creator's Voice video, this time focused on Koshi Nakanishi, the director of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>With the game launching later this week on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, the video focuses on providing an introduction to the story along with the wider franchise itself. It also goes into how easy it was to develop Requiem for the Switch 2, with Nakanishi-san promoting features like GameChat for those who might be a bit too scared to play on their own.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 has improved graphical specs, so we wondered if Requiem could run on it – and it did, with ease. When we, the development team, first saw it in our hands, we were sceptical too, so we had to do a triple take. We thought to ourselves 'Oh, this is really running on Nintendo Switch 2?. It all worked so smoothly that we just decided to go ahead with the game as-is and make it for the console. With specs like these in handheld mode, it looks great.</p>
<p>"With Nintendo Switch 2, you also have GameChat. That's perfect for horror games. Even players who think they can't play alone can have fun together just by inviting friends to watch. So I feel like GameChat was made just for Resident Evil."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nakanishi-san also mentions that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/zelda_ii_the_adventure_of_link">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a> is one of his preferred games in the <strong>Zelda</strong> series. When he directed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/resident_evil_revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a> for the 3DS, he designed the Scarmiglione enemies to act in a similar manner to the armoured soldiers in Zelda II, raising their shields up and down to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem are making the rounds online, so be extra careful in these final days leading up to release. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/please-dont-post-or-share-pre-release-leaks-and-spoilers-capcom-sets-its-sights-on-resident-evil-requiem-leakers">Capcom has pleaded with fans</a> not to share any leaks, while original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a> creator Hideki Kamiya has also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-a-thousand-deaths-says-hideki-kamiya">provided his own opinion</a> on the matter.</p>
