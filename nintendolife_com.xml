Square Enix has announced that its music and merchandising arm is teaming up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> (yep, <em>the</em> Undertale) on a special line of merch to celebrate the latter's 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>Details are pretty slim on what this collaboration will entail for the time being, but the Square Enix statement shared to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/square-enix-games.com/post/3m65gk7kzj22i">Bluesky</a> promises "Music, apparel... things a little strange, but somehow wonderful, are starting to take shape".</p>
<p>We also know that the collaboration will be available <em>worldwide</em>, so you'll be able to get your hands on the merch (whatever it turns out to be) wherever you are.</p><div><figure data-videoid="cx2Jhoc0rgQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cx2Jhoc0rgQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytcx2Jhoc0rgQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cx2Jhoc0rgQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cx2Jhoc0rgQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38ea9fiqgzxj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the full announcement statement, followed by the post itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huh?! UNDERTALE X SQUARE ENIX?!<br>
...Yeah, you read that right.<br>
To celebrate UNDERTALE's 10th anniversary, a special collaboration with SQEX Music &amp; Merchandising is happening!</p>
<p>Music, apparel... things a little strange, but somehow wonderful, are starting to take shape. There are even whispers of some mysterious new merch...</p>
<p>And this project isn't stopping in one place-it's rolling out worldwide! With ten years of DETERMINATION in its heart, SQEX Music &amp; Merchandising will deliver this quirky dream collaboration to fans across the globe!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The specifics on the merch will have to wait for another day — the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/UNDERTALE/en/">Square Enix website</a> is currently awash with "Coming Soon" messages on the 'Goods' front — but we do know that a chilled soundtrack titled '<a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/undertale_-chitei-de-chill">Undertale: Chitei de Chill</a>' will be released early next year.</p>
<p>This one is now available to pre-order from the <a href="https://gb.store.square-enix-games.com/undertale_-chitei-de-chill">Square Enix Store</a> for <strong>$39.99 / £29.99</strong>, and features renditions of 20 Undertale tracks in beautifully chilled arrangements. You'll find the sweet new cover art, by painter NOVOL, and the official CD blurb text below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new album from SQUARE ENIX MUSIC's popular Chill Arrangement series, featuring music from UNDERTALE to commemorate the role-playing game's 10th anniversary!<br>
This album includes twenty meticulously selected tracks of popular songs such as “Megalovania,” “His Theme,” and “Hopes and Dreams,” arranged by ten distinguished Japanese artists: Muro, tofubeats, VaVa, DJ Mitsu the Beats, grooveman Spot, doooo, DJ JIN, GORO KUMAI, G.RINA, and DJ HASEBE.<br>
The melodies that once colored the underground world have been reborn as gentle chill sounds, creating a work that lets you experience a new side of UNDERTALE.<br>
The cover illustration is an original piece created by the painter NOVOL. Enjoy this special arrangement album where music and art come together.</p>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more from this anniversary collaboration over the coming months — our poor wallets...</p>
