<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fcd6f6dd4267/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Resident Evil</strong> series has seen pretty strong representation on the Switch, but it's perhaps safe to say that fans aren't best pleased with some titles being relegated to 'Cloud Versions'.</p>
<p>We're still waiting to see whether Capcom is keen to re-release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_3_-_cloud_version">RE3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_7_biohazard_cloud">RE7</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_village_cloud">RE Village</a> natively on the Switch 2, but for now, it seems the company is <em>potentially</em> considering bringing its latest entry to Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is due for release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> and, according to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who has been known to leak RE news prior to official announcements, the game is supposedly being planned for release on both the Switch 2 and the PS4.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qlrmtu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's what they had to say via <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963021049014190354">X</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I won't be at around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda' known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine.</p>
<p>"I'm not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. Talked about it with five different people in the last few weeks and know another guy with a good reputation said as much less than a week ago. So not from me, but I have been hearing the same thing.</p>
<p>"Unsure if it'll be at launch, and my guess is it'll be a different version with different tech, sorta' like the 360 / PS3 &amp; Wii / PS2 era, since some features of Requiem like ray tracing are focused on modern platforms.</p>
<p>But if the question is, is it happening or not, the answer pretty much is, yeah it's happening."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as mentioned, if Requiem were to come to the Switch 2, then it may not release day-and-date with the scheduled launch in February. As for the visuals and performance, well... that seems somewhat obvious, right? Still, if this is true, then it's not <em>entirely</em> surprising. <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Capcom's president recently</a> stated that the initial response to the Switch 2 caught the company off-guard, so it seems reasonable to assume that it'll want to take advantage of the exceptionally strong sales.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will star Grace Ashcroft, daughter of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft, who is instructed to investigate a series of strange deaths at the sinister Wrenwood Hotel. The game will also pay a visit to the ruined wasteland of Raccoon City, and it's heavily rumoured that RE veteran Leon Kennedy will play a role, possibly as a second playable protagonist.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil franchise will also be celebrating its 30th anniversary next year, with Capcom recently launching a <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/30th.html">dedicated website</a> to commemorate the milestone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this update, we made specification changes to some main weapons to make their individual characteristics stand out. We also made balance changes to multiplayer based on changes observed after adding the Splatlands Collection.</p>
<p>For three types of main weapons—Splash-o-matic, .52 Gal, and Splat Brella—rather than simple upgrades, we made specification changes to make their individual characteristics stand out.</p>
<p>For Splash-o-matic, we extended the flight distance for shots to make it easier to take advantage of its characteristic where the accuracy of your aim directly applies to your ability to defeat opponents. On the other hand, we decreased its ability to ink to make it more difficult to fight in ways that don’t take advantage of accurate aim, such as maintaining battle lines without direct confrontations or using special weapons with high frequency.</p>
<p>For the .52 Gal, we increased the speed of shots to make it easier to fight by taking advantage of its high attack power to defeat several opponents in a short time and create big opportunities. On the other hand, we increased the amount of ink consumed to make it harder to fight in a way that maintains battle lines over time.</p>
<p>For the Splat Brella, we expanded the area of its inking to make it easier to fight by taking advantage of its ability to defend from attacks to keep opponents in check and maintain battle lines, or to use the canopy to prolong the durations of battles to cooperate with allies. We also created a distinction between it and other Brellas by expanding the area of its shots. This makes it easier to support allies by dealing small, reliable damage, while at the same time making it so that in one-on-one fights, players must get closer than before to fight in ways that can quickly defeat opponents. We have also adjusted the number of points required for special weapons to ensure that special-weapon frequency does not rise higher than necessary as a result of expanding the area it inks.</p>
<p>For other main weapons, we made changes to make them easier to use by shoring up their weaknesses.</p>
<p>As for special weapons, for the Zipcaster we made changes so that it’s easier to fight with in combination with certain main weapons.</p>
<p>For the Ink Vac, we made changes so that when used in one-on-one situations, it is harder to be left open by quickly filling up the ink tank, but it also has greater effect when used well to block opponents’ shots.</p>
<p>For the Ink Storm, by expanding the area of effect, we made it easier to use it to force opponents lying in wait in advantageous positions to move, and easier for allies to fight within the area.</p>
<p>Additionally, we made changes to the points required for special weapons, taking into account changes observed since the addition of the Splatlands Collection.</p>
<p>The next update will focus on changes to the balance of battles.</p>

<p>Forsaken 64 is coming to Nintendo Classics</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has announced it's bringing the first-person shooter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a> to its "Mature" Switch Online + Expansion Pack app.</p>
<p>The Acclaim Entertainment title, released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998 and developed by Iguana UK, will be arriving for the Switch and Switch 2 online service on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>. Here's the official Nintendo description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed "Forsaken." Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanized terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom. Choose between different modes in this first-person shooter title released for the Nintendo 64™ system in 1998, and enter the fight in Single Player Mode or Multi-Player Mode. Then, select your bike. Each bike has different attributes, each biker a different attitude. Pick one that suits your style, then dive into your mission. The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, you'll need to have an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription tier as well as the "mature" version of the N64 app to play this game on your Switch or Switch 2. You can download this version of the app from the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>This latest N64 Switch Online announcement also happens to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">follow a rumour in July</a>, which may have identified unannounced releases for this particular app. Apart from Forsaken 64, the games spotted included <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Smash Bros.</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>.</p>
<p>In Japan this week, Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers get to revisit Brownie Brown's GBA RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Nintendo has been rolling out regular firmware updates to help improve this, and following yesterday's major system update (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-4-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">bumping the Switch 2 up to Version 20.4.0</a>), a handful of games are now running as intended.</p>
<p>As highlighted by Universo Nintendo, this list includes multiple third-party titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/killing_time_resurrected">Killing Time: Resurrected</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/melty_blood_type_lumina">Melty Blood: Type Lumina</a>, and more. Here's the rundown:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qlrmtu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo also recently identified some issues with other Switch titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition</a> (including a voice sync bug), and <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-identifies-xenoblade-x-issue-on-switch-2/">another recent update</a> reportedly got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nobody_saves_the_world">Nobody Saves The World</a> fully functioning on the new system.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Nintendo has been rolling out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2-updates-for-multiple-first-party-switch-games-are-now-available">multiple free updates for its first-party Switch library</a>, improving frame rate and resolution on the Switch 2.
