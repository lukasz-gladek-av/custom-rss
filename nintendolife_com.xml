<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">Nintendo announced</a> a line of child-friendly products under the 'My Mario' banner, including a free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app for Switch and mobile, cute sets of wooden block amiibo, and assorted merch aimed at babies and toddlers.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before it all found its way out of Japan and the company has now confirmed that the line will be launching in the US from <strong>19th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Designed "to offer fun ways for young children and their parents to explore, imagine and play side-by-side," according to the official blurb, the collection will be coming to the Nintendo New York and San Francisco stores in February and appearing at "select retail stores" in the spring. There's no word on a UK or European release just yet, but we'll update this article when we get confirmation on this side of the pond.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qvhgkm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
