<p>Chibi-Robo returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be bringing Chibi-Robo to the Switch 2's GameCube library next week on 21st August, 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little robot who wants to bring happiness to all!</p>
<p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCubeâ„¢ system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To play this title on Switch 2 you'll need to have an active subscription to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service.</p>
