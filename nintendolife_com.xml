<figure data-uuid="2c836875913a2"><a title="Leon Kennedy - RE6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2c836875913a2/leon-kennedy-re6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: IGN</em></figcaption></figure><p>Leon Kennedy has finally been confirmed to appear in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>; though perhaps not in the way that Capcom had hoped.</p>
<p>Yes, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-leak-reveals">IGN</a>, the veteran character now shows up via the PSN store when users go to the pre-download page. The updated key art shows Leon in the background behind the game's other key protagonist, Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<p>As for Leon himself, he is sporting a similar jacket to his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, while his signature hairdo is well and truly present. He certainly comes across more grizzled than previous appearances; almost like a cross between Resident Evil 4 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0prlmqt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>It's likely that Leon's official reveal was scheduled for the game's upcoming new trailer during The Game Awards, but the cat is out of the bag.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the image in full:</p>
<figure data-uuid="1e3350d9795bc"><a title="Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e3350d9795bc/requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: IGN</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Capcom has remained tightlipped on Leon's appearance in Requiem, though the company has consistently described the game as a mix between more classic survival horror gameplay and action-oriented scenes.</p>
<p>It's likely, then, that Grace Ashcroft will feature in the slower, more horror-focused sections, while Leon – being the hardened agent that he is – will take on the more action-heavy set pieces.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="00fdbae6feec5"><a title="Romancing SaGa International" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00fdbae6feec5/romancing-saga-international.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix/Red Art Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's only been three years since we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_-minstrel_song-_remastered">Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered</a> on Switch consoles, itself a remaster of 1991's seminal SNES adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/romancing_saga">Romancing SaGa</a> (or Romancing Salsa as this writer always calls it because of the font they used for the artwork).</p>
<p>Now, Red Art Games has announced that a further enhancement of the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_-minstrel_song-_remastered_international">Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered International</a> (looking forward to the International Universal edition in 2028, then) is now available on Switch consoles in both digital and physical form.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ruhqvy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>This latest release for the cult classic RPG is, in fact, the 2022 remaster with new localisations, so all the tweaks that version brought along are here, but there have been further fixes mixed in. Here's the full list of updates from the press release, with <strong>the new ones highlighted in bold</strong> for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Key Features include:</p><p>

<strong>- New French, German, Italian and Spanish localisations (International edition exclusive)</strong><br>
- Full HD graphical upgrade<br>
- New recruitable characters: Schiele, Marina, Monica and Flammar<br>
- Enhanced and more challenging bosses<br>
- High-speed mode<br>
- Mini-maps<br>
- New Game+<br>
- Japanese or English voice options via in-game menu (International edition exclusive)</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>As pointed out by Red Art, who is publishing this "in association with Square Enix", and it's important to make this doubly clear: "The key differences in <em>Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered International</em> compared to the 2022 digital release are the addition of French, German, Italian and Spanish text localisations and a number of minor bug fixes. All other game content remains identical."</p>
<p>The announcement also reiterates that "as this International edition is sold separately, players who wish to access the new European language options will need to purchase this new version physically or digitally." Which seems a bit silly, but there you have it.</p>
<p>Of course, more excitingly, we've also got some physical editions available <a href="https://www.redartgames.com/">via Red Art Games</a> (or <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/search?type=article%2Cpage%2Cproduct&amp;q=romancing*+saga*+minstrel*+song*&amp;bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP for North America</a>) which collectors should be very interested in. The physical edition here comes in four versions: your regular old standard, a special edition which throws in a PVC keychain and reversible cover, a deluxe edition, which also throws in an exclusive sleeve with alternate cover art and a game manual.</p>

<p>There's also this snazzy collector's edition to round out the goodies, which gives you everything in the other versions plus a box with retro-inspired cover art, a steelcase, art book and three postcards. All special, deluxe and collector's copies are limited to just 500 copies per console platform, too, so don't delay if you're interested.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, the standard edition of the game comes in at £29.95/$29.99, whilst that fancy collector's edition works the price up to £69.99 (or whatever that amounts to where you are). The digital, meanwhile, is £26.99/$29.99 on the old eShop.</p>

<p>Holidays are coming</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>You know the festive season is well and truly here when No Gravity Games announces its annual 'Switchmas Giveaway', where the studio dishes out a selection of its back catalogue <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>Well, the time is almost upon us once more, as No Gravity Games has announced that this year's giveaway will kick off on <strong>12th December</strong>, with one free game available each and every day until 18th December, before the event wraps up with a whopping <em>three freebies</em> on 19th.</p>
<p>As ever, there are a few hoops you'll need to jump through if you want to add every game in the giveaway to your library. Firstly, the giveaway is only for those with a <strong>North American eShop account</strong>. Secondly, you need to own <em>any game</em> from the No Gravity Games portfolio to get the offer up and running — and that includes the one you can get for free by signing up to the company's newsletter.</p>
<p>We'll be updating this post with the full list of this year's free games, though you can check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/no-gravity-games-wraps-up-winter-giveaway-with-final-two-free-switch-games-north-america">last year's line-up</a> to get an idea of what's in store.</p>
<p>The giveaway works on a chain basis, where you have to redeem each day's freebie if you want to be entitled to the next drop. No Gravity Games will list the free game of the day on the eShop with a '100% off' discount for 24 hours, and will keep it "heavily discounted" the next day, so you have a chance to buy back into the chain if you forget to download one day.</p>
<p>To be clear, these giveaways are rarely packed with blockbuster hits, but if you're keen to beef up your Switch library and don't want to spend a penny while doing it, you might want to follow along.</p>
<p><em>Will you be taking part in this year's No Gravity Games giveaway? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>

The game performed considerably better on the Switch 2, making up 83% of the platform split with the original Switch.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a>' Christopher Dring, physical sales for Prime 4 were down 15% when compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, though he calls this marginal at "just a few thousand units".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which launched on the same day as Prime 4, almost didn't even chart at all, coming in at number 37 with the majority of sales on the original Switch. Similarly, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> saw a slight bump up from last week to land at number 19, Switch 2 sales still lagged behind the PS5.</p>
