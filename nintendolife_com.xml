<p>City Connection and Granzella have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fz-formation-z">FZ: Formation Z</a>, the side-scrolling robot shooter from all the way back in the perm-riddled dark days of 1984 (so long ago this writer had a full head of hair!), is to be resurrected on Switch 2 this very year (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2026/01/city-connection-and-granzellas-formation-z-remake-finally-has-a-release-date">Time Extension</a>).</p>
<p>Now, 1984 is a long time ago, yes, and so you may be thinking 'meh' to the idea of resurrecting something so very antiquated. Until you check out the trailer at the top of this article, that is. Also, you may have already played the OG game already on Switch via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_formation_z">Arcade Archive re-release</a> and are now just a rabid fan. Welcome, either way!</p>
<p>It does seem as though the devs here have gone to town with this remake of a Jaleco golden oldie, with a full revision of everything from the graphics, gameplay, and sound, whilst "staying true to the classic gameplay and intuitive controls of switching between Robot and Flight forms". They've even brought new weapons to the table. It certainly looks like a good time, judging by the intense and colourful action on show in the gameplay vid, with some very nice <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/r-type_dimensions_ex">R-Type</a>-but-with-big-stonking-robots vibes that this writer is here for all day long.</p>
<p>The remake will release in Japan on 21st May across multiple platforms, and although a Western release hasn't been officially confirmed for Switch at the time of writing, the trailer above does contain the Clear River Games logo, who were attached to publish the game in Europe according to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/11/embracer-group-interim-report-leaks-fz-formation-z-western-release-plans">a release plan leak from Embracer Group</a>. So, fingers crossed, then.</p>
<p>More good news: It'll arrive in both digital and physical forms, and the physical isn't a Game-Key Card, either. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Digital editions will set you back 4400 yen (so roughly £20 or whatever that is where you're located). The physical edition comes in two flavours: a fancy Limited Edition for 14,850 yen (around the £70 mark) which includes a soundtrack, robot-making kit, bonus weapon content and a fancy box for presentation, and a slightly less snazzy standard physical for 5,940 yen (almost 30 British pounds).</p>
<p>Finally, here's some more official details, as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2728420/FZ_Formation_Z/">the Steam page</a>, and some screens:</p>
