            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Hades II" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad3040c80e608/hades-ii.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, the long-awaited follow up to Supergiant Games' roguelike masterclass, launches on Switch and Switch 2 this week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Our own review is still in the works, but don't worry, it'll be here very soon. In the meantime, a whole bunch of outlets have gone live with their own verdicts on the game, so we thought it might be wise to collate just a few of them here and hopefully give you a flavour of its overall quality.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's dive right into it...</p>
<p>First up, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-review">IGN</a> awards Hades II a rare 10/10 and calls it Supergiant's "best work on nearly every level":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How do you even sum up something as beautiful, special, memorable, and admirable as Hades 2? There is no one out there doing what Supergiant does as well as it does, and this exceptional action roguelite is some of this team’s best work on nearly every level (which is an astonishingly high bar to clear). It's the type of video game that reminds me why I love video games so damn much. The art is breathtaking, the characters are captivating, the combat is fast, fun, endlessly varied, and tactical, and the music is spectacular. May moonlight guide us. All of us."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-review">Eurogamer</a> provides its own perfect 5/5 score and simply calls Hades II "epic":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I've pushed past the credits and am onto the hunt for the 'true' ending, now, and I am still being surprised by what can still be found tucked into the creases and folds of Hades 2. Supergiant's visionary approach to storytelling and roguelike design has not suffered at all from the success of Hades: it merely emboldened it. That the studio can still dole out the surprises after how rich and textural Hades was, and that I still find myself floored by the ambition, the detail, the art, the technical prowess, and the willingness to cede control to players some 60-plus hours in is miraculous. Maybe it's witchcraft. Maybe it's magic. Either way, it's epic."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/hades-2-review-switch-2/">Destructoid</a> delivers its 9.5 verdict and definitively calls it a "perfect game for the Switch 2":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just like its predecessors, <em>Hades 2</em> is a perfect game for the Switch 2. In just about a week of hands-on time with the 1.0 release, it’s become my most-played game on Nintendo’s new console in its three-plus months since release, and I don’t see that changing any time soon with a couple dozen hours already invested. At $30, this game is a steal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/72565/hades-ii-switch-2-review">Nintendo World Report</a> says that the game surpasses its predecessor in "a number of ways" in its 9/10 review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will take me dozens more hours to see all of what Hades II has to offer, and that’s not even considering some specific endgame challenges it adds after you complete your first run. I am fully invested in squeezing all of the story juice from this delicious fruit, and that’s primarily due to how masterful the gameplay feels. Moving, dashing, attacking, and casting are all incredibly satisfying, and it’s rare to see any video game so skillfully combine gameplay with aesthetic and story. Without a doubt, Hades II lives up to its predecessor, and surpasses it in a number of ways. While it can at times be overwhelming in terms of collectibles and crafting materials, there are also so many ways to enjoy the experience, through options like God Mode and Aim Assist, or just grinding out in-game achievements and other unlockables. Ultimately, my first complete run through the first Hades signalled the end of my time with that game, but for the sequel, it felt more like I was just getting started."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/hades-ii/">RPG Fan</a> delivers a score of 90/100 and says that the new entry definitely lives up to the original:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So does <em>Hades II</em> live up to the original? Absolutely. It retains much of what made the first title great while offering a different kind of gameplay. With <em>Hades II</em>, Supergiant Games proves that even Zeus can’t claim a monopoly on lightning striking twice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hades-2/">VGC</a> is slightly more critical with its 4/5 star review, noting that Hades II doesn't have the same thematic weight of the first game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a sequel, Hades 2 is ambitious, and delivers one of the most satisfying roguelite experiences in years. Yet, it can’t escape the shadow of its predecessor, and in trying to add every idea possible to amplify its scale, the story ends up losing the trademark weight of the studio."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ac7586943680/mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> from Illumination was… well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/movie-review-the-super-mario-bros-movie-a-fun-ride-that-substitutes-story-for-spectacle"><em>okay</em> at best</a>.</p>
<p>It got a fair bit right, like the excellent visual presentation and delightful Easter Eggs throughout its 92-minute runtime. But a weak script, baffling casting decisions, and reliance on licensed music over iconic tracks from Koji Kondo resulted in a middling experience that I wasn’t too keen to watch again.</p>
<p>Alas, I did watch it again – many, <em>many</em> times. And the reason why is simple: I have a three-year-old daughter. Need I say more?</p>
<p>Well, I will. Y’see, my family and I were fortunate enough to go on a cruise toward the end of last year, stopping off at Hamburg, Bruges, Rotterdam, and Le Havre. Our cabin’s TV included a range of on-demand movies, one of which was — you guessed it — <del>Terrifier 3</del> the Mario Movie.</p>
<p>So whenever we had a bit of downtime, which normally came toward the end of the day when we were getting ready to hit the hay, we’d stick the Mario Movie on for my daughter after much begging on her part. And I have to admit, watching her eyes light up whenever Princess Peach came on the screen, or when she giggled in delight when Bowser trapped Kamek’s fingers in a piano, my opinion of the film began to shift.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a15ab7e93eefe/mario-and-luigi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I still don't think it's a great film or anything, but my daughter's enthusiasm became infectious. It is, after all, a movie primarily aimed toward kids, and so I started to view it through that exact lens. All of its faults — everything that I, as a self-proclaimed movie connoisseur, saw as blights upon a game series I'd adored since the mid-'90s — faded into the background.</p>
<p>Soon enough, we bought our daughter plushies of Mario, Luigi, and Peach, and we'd begin to act out scenes from the film together (with my wife begrudgingly playing the role of Bowser – heh!). This not only strengthened her love for the film, but also the bond that she and I had begun to foster.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the first couple of years of fatherhood were quite difficult for me; family and friends warn you that young children like to pick favourites and play parents off against one another, but I'm quite sure my daughter took this concept to its absolute limits, and it honestly pushed me to breaking point. So when she fell in love with the Mario Movie, it opened up a crucial opportunity for me to finally break down that barrier, and for nearly a year, we've enjoyed a wonderful relationship together that's only gotten better with time.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Toys" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e548a373d4e2/mario-toys.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Needless to say, when I showed her the first trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (which officially releases on 3rd April 2026, by the way), she was thrilled beyond words. And so was I, for that matter. I love the Galaxy games so much, and I genuinely can't think of a more appropriate direction for the upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>What's even better is that, thanks to the aforementioned cruise ship also containing a small cinema, my daughter has proven that she's capable of sitting through a movie and staying reasonably engaged from beginning to end. So you can bet we'll be right there at our local Vue on day one for the sequel. This has the potential to be a memory that will last until my dying days, and that is far more precious to me than any criticism I might have against Nintendo and Illumination's work on the adaptations so far.</p>
<p>I'll never try to convince those who don't want children that they're making the wrong choice; parenting is <em>really</em> hard, man. But it's also full of magical moments that I wouldn't change for the world – or the galaxy, for that matter. The Super Mario Bros. Movie might not be anywhere close to being a masterpiece, but my goodness, am I glad it exists.</p>
<p>Bring on the sequel.</p>

<p>In a surprise announcement during its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rD0i4pOTk">TGS 2025 Online Program</a>, Capcom has announced a big free update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</a> on Switch (and other platforms) coming on <strong>19th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, fans are probably disappointed that it's not a brand new game, <em>but</em> this update does bring the trilogy up-to-snuff with other Ace Attorney compilations.</p>
<p>The biggest addition for some will be the addition of two new languages: Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Now more people than ever will be able to enjoy these classic games in their native language.</p>
<p>Other new features coming to the original trilogy include an art gallery, the ability to select any episode at any time from each game, a story mode that automatically solves puzzles for you, a music player, and a scene creator.</p>

<p>Some of these features are already available in other games like Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, so it's good to see Capcom going back and making tweaks.</p>
<p>If you somehow <em>still</em> haven't picked this up on Switch, then let us sway you <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">with our review</a>. Then you'll realise that you have a new franchise to be obsessed with and a lot of games to get through!</p>

<p>Rejoice, Gods and Goddesses! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> launches on Switch and Switch 2 tomorrow, 25th September 2025. Gosh, can time slow down a little bit? There are <em>so many</em> games coming out at the moment.</p>
<p>You'll see reviews have gone live at a number of sites today and might be thinking "wait, where are NL's impressions?" Well, they're coming very soon! So keep an eye out in the coming days.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't quite wait, however, Felix has put together some early impressions of Supergiant Games' first-ever sequel. And, don't worry, if you've never dipped into the Early Access version of the game on Steam, there's no need to fear spoilers, as we're keeping things contained to the early hours.</p>
<p>We've also got some comparisons between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — longer load times and less-crisp visuals, and only 60fps in docked and handheld, while on Switch 2, docked performance is 120fps.</p>

<p>So if you're not sure whether to dive in tomorrow or just want to get a little bit more excited for Hades II, have a look at Felix's video up top. And then check back very soon for our full review.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget, Hades II is getting a full physical edition, and it will have the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions on the cart! If you can't wait, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/heres-when-hades-2-releases-in-your-time-zone">we've got a rundown of when the game drops in your region digitally</a>.</p>
