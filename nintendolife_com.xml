With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-missions-and-rewards-october-2025-dk-bananza-dlc-mario-galaxy-mario-party-3-marios-super-picross">Nintendo Switch Online Missions &amp; Rewards Program</a>, you can nab some rather unique icons for your Switch profile.</p>
<p>Now, you <em>could</em> grab some icons for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party_3">Mario Party 3</a> — and they're quite nice, too — but have you seen those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a> icons? No? Well just look at them! (Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/IconsNSO/status/1975373237623418889">NSO Icon Alerts</a> for highlighting them!)</p>
<p>These icons, shown below, are part of the monthly Play &amp; Redeem scheme for NSO members. All you have to do is boot up Mario's Super Picross on the SNES app and then you can purchase those icon elements using Platinum Points.</p>
<p>It doesn't even take 10 seconds if you have the SNES app downloaded already, so if you like 'em and you have the points... What's stopping you?</p>

<p>Mario's Super Picross was added to the Nintendo Classics service (formerly Nintendo Switch Online) back in 2020. Acting as a direct sequel to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/marios_picross">Game Boy original</a>, this one is largely the same, except once you beat the first level, you'll have access to Wario's version of the game, where you have additional rules to consider.</p>
<p>The game only launched in Japan on the Super Famicom, though it did launch on the PAL Wii and Wii U Virtual Console stores in 2007 and 2013 respectively.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Switch Online release is available to everyone. Plus, If you have a Switch 2 (or a USB mouse) you can actually play it with mouse controls, too!</p>

<p>But what could it mean?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a surprise new short film called '<strong>Close To You</strong>' and it's... not what we expected from the House of Mario.</p>
<p>Initially shared on the Nintendo Today! app before cropping up on YouTube and socials, the short follows a baby that learns to take its first steps via the magic of a sentient dummy (or pacifier, if you'd rather).</p>
<p>It feels very Toy Story, and the animation style has big Pixar energy to boot, but the strangest part of it all is how it feels very... un-Nintendo. There's no Mario to seen, the baby doesn't stumble past some Joy-Con at any point, there's not even a Pikmin cameo.</p>
<p>Or is there? It feels to us like there's something missing in this short. Don't you get the impression that we <em>should</em> be seeing something carrying the dummy or pushing the blocks? Do we spy something moving under the bed in the background <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsufGY5I8jA&amp;t=99s">around 1:38</a>? Doesn't the music sound a little <em>too</em> Pikmin-coded?</p>

<figure data-uuid="d1d7a901a905b"><a title="Nintendo Close To You Zoom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d1d7a901a905b/nintendo-close-to-you-zoom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The whole thing has a whiff of an invisible Pikmin scheme to us, but hey, that's just a theory. Whether this turns out to be something bigger, well, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this animated short? Do you think it will be part of something larger? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>
