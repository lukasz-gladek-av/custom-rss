<p>Jackbox Games has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/jackbox_party_pack_11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a>, scheduled to launch on the Switch later this year.</p>
<p>It's looking pretty ridiculous, which is exactly what we've come to expect from the Jackbox franchise, so if you're looking to play a few fun party with family or friends on Christmas Day or Boxing Day (or really any day), then you might want to check this one out.</p>
<p>The minigame highlight for us has to be <strong>Hear Say</strong>, which essentially has you recording sound effects via your phone which are then played in short clips for the other players. It looks (or rather sounds) pretty hilarious.</p>
<p>The full selection of minigames included are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><u><em>- Legends of Trivia</em></u>:</strong> Work with your party to fight fantasy monsters in this cooperative trivia battle<strong><br>
- <u><em>Suspectives</em></u>:</strong> Investigate a crime and defend your innocence in this social deduction game where every player is on trial<strong><br>
- <u><em>Doominate</em></u>:</strong> Wreck wholesome ideas in this hilarious, head-to-head joke‑writing game<strong><br>
- <u><em>Hear Say</em></u>:</strong> Record custom sound effects and watch them come to life in this sound‑based party game<strong><br>
- <u><em>Cookie Haus</em></u>:</strong> Sketch strange desserts based on bizarre prompts in this cozy drawing game</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be sure to let you know the final release date for Jackbox Party Pack 11 as soon as we hear (say) more.</p>

<p>Brace Yourself Games is continuing its stellar lineup of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> crossover DLC with a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/everhood">Everhood</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>The succinctly named 'Everhood Music Pack' adds four new tracks to the falling notes rhythm game, all of which will be available to purchase separately or as a bundle. The DLC is now live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/57784/Rift__Everhood_Music_Pack/">Steam</a>, and the developers have announced that it will be falling onto Switch "at a later date" — so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Here are the four tracks from the RPG mash-up series that you'll find in this new wave of crossover bonus content:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Final Battle" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Feisty Flowers" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Revenge" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Why Oh You Are LOVE" by Dancefloor is Lava</li>
</ul>
<p>To see in the new releases in style, Brace Yourself Games is also adding a <em>free</em> Rhythm Rift, 'Powers of Destruction' by Cazok, for good measure.</p>
<p>This crossover DLC follows similar collaborations with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pizza_tower">Pizza Tower</a> and Hatsune Miku, and it looks like there's even more to come — which is exciting, because the base game is really rather good. We called Rift of the NecroDancer "a smart, stylish remix of what rhythm games can be" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/rift-of-the-necrodancer">our review</a>, which you can check out in full below.</p>
