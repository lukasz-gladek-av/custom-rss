<p>Just one week after kickoff</p>

<figure data-uuid="942f8b4415014"><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/942f8b4415014/inazuma-eleven-victory-road.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>The much-delayed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> finally arrived on Switch and Switch 2 last week, and Level-5 has today announced that the football RPG has already scored its first major sales milestone.</p>
<p>As shared by company CEO Akihiro Hino on <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1991399440079552852">X</a>, Victory Road has already surpassed 500,000 sales worldwide. Sure, this is across <em>all</em> platforms (including PS4, PS5, Xbox Series and Steam), but that's no mean feat for a title that has been this long in the making.</p>
<p>"We will leverage the strengths of a download-only title to make the game even more enjoyable and add new content," Hino wrote in the accompanying tweet (via Google Translate), "so please look forward to it!".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owkmhy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>And new content <em>is</em> inbound, it seems. In the blog post marking the sales milestone on the <a href="https://www.inazuma.jp/victory-road/topics/251120/">Inazuma Eleven website</a>, Level-5 mentions that it will be adding new "Galaxy", "Scales of Ares" and "Seal of Orion" routes (presumably based on the anime series of the same name) to the game's throwback Chronicle Mode, as well as an online tournament and additional free content in the future too.</p>
<p>We'll have our full review of Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road with you before long, so keep an eye out for that one!</p>

<p>This literally can't fit on a cartridge</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ac15c7c16a707"><a title="Aerith" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac15c7c16a707/aerith.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has just posted an update on the expected file size for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As we had perhaps expected, it's big, folks. Like, real big. Store listings on the eShop already have some pretty lofty numbers attached to them, but according to Square Enix, these actually aren't accurate.</p>
<p>As stated on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1991431395873530291">X</a>, the file size for the <strong>Standard Edition will be 90GB to 95GB</strong>. Meanwhile, the <strong>Limited Early Purchase Edition and Limited Early Purchase Digital Deluxe Editions will be 93.8GB to 99GB</strong>.</p>

<p>Woof! This means, of course, that the game simply won't fit on a 64GB cartridge for its physical release, and so Square Enix has, like many others, opted for a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>It makes us wonder just how large <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</a> will be alongside the untitled third entry. Is it possible that these three games combined simply won't fit on the Switch 2 without an additional microSD Express Card..?</p>
<p>Needless to say, if you've yet to invest in some extra storage space, now might be the time to do so. We suspect 2026 is going to be packed with some pretty sizeable ports, so you're going to want to have all the spare GBs you can get.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking via social media, the team stated that the delay would "help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver". Though a specific date has not been specified, we can currently expect to see it launch in March 2026.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Development Update for OPUS: Prism Peak</p>

<p>After revisiting our timeline, we can now confirm that OPUS: Prism Peak is planned for release in March 2026. Thank you so much for your continued support.</p>
<p>We’re truly sorry for the delay. We know this isn’t the news you were hoping for.</p>
<p>But we believe this extra time will help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver.</p>
<p>Everyone at SIGONO is giving their best, and we’re committed to bringing OPUS: Prism Peak to you in its strongest form when it arrives in March 2026.</p>

<p>We covered OPUS: Prism Peak with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/opus-prism-peak-will-capture-your-heart-with-new-teaser">teaser trailer</a> all the way back in 2023, so it's safe to say that this game has been in the public eye for quite some time. Here's hoping it will satisfy fans of the series when it eventually launches in 2026.</p>

Although he puts his all into communicating his work – which is perhaps evident in the lengthy Direct presentations for the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> – he nevertheless refrains from "trying to promote myself":</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adtyrxuh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I think I've always wanted to live an unassuming life. I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. Becoming a laughing stock on the internet would be problematic. That's why I frequently turn down requests for interviews. I think it's best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems reasonable to us! In addition to his games, Sakurai is also well-known for his work on YouTube. With the 'Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games' channel, he offloads a heap of information about the process of game development for would-be creators. His work proved such a success that he was even listed as a recipient of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/masahiro-sakurai-receives-award-from-japanese-government">Cultural Affairs' annual Art Encouragement Prize for New Artists</a> over in Japan.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders, meanwhile, is out now for the Switch 2. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">8/10 review</a>, we said that it's a "chaotic and frenzied racer", but one that's also "got depth for those who wish to learn".</p>
