<p>Out on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">Dragon Quest I</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_ii">Dragon Quest II</a> are much-expanded compared to their original releases. There's tons of new story content, optional dungeons, quests, Mini Medals, skills, spells... the list goes on. Essentially, this is a transformative remake of two iconic classic RPGs.</p><div><figure data-videoid="GReZx3uoZNA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytGReZx3uoZNA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed640b4eqwytxk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>And we absolutely loved it: We scored the Nintendo Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">a glowing 9/10</a>, concluding that "Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is a deeply satisfying follow-up to last year’s remake project, closing out the Erdrick trilogy on a fittingly high note."</p>

<p>You want to know what's better than 30fps?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>GameMill Entertainment has today announced that the family-friendly co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nicktoons_and_the_dice_of_destiny">Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</a> will be landing a free Switch 2 upgrade on <strong>5th December</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will run at 60fps, with a crisp 1240p resolution. There's a bunch of other visual good stuff to look out for too, including improved anti-aliasing, particle effects, lighting and more.</p>
<p>All those with the Switch 1 version of the game (which launched back in September), can upgrade to the Switch 2 version completely free. Alternatively, the full Switch 2 edition will be available on the Switch eShop for <strong>£39.99 / €49.99</strong>, or physically via a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the Switch 2 version in action:</p>

<p>If this one hasn't entered your sphere yet, the Dice of Destiny is an ARPG inspired by fantasy tabletop adventures. You'll put together a band of familiar Nickelodeon faces like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, Jimmy Neutron, Susie Carmichael or Katara, and use each character's special skills to take out enemies in a magical land.</p>
<p>There's every chance that this one slipped under the radar for you back in a busy September period, and the new early-December release date falls in an equally jam-packed week, but hey, at least it gives everyone another chance to check it out.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2c81f39347cf8"><a title="Bandai Namco And Square Enix Join Other Japanese Publishers In Uproar Over OpenAI's Sora 2 Video Generation Tool 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2c81f39347cf8/bandai-namco-and-square-enix-join-other-japanese-publishers-in-uproar-over-openais-sora-2-video-generation-tool-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japanese video game giants Bandai Namco and Square Enix have joined other companies such as the Sony-owned Aniplex, Studio Ghibli, Square Enix, Kadokawa and Shueisha in requesting that OpenAI refrain from training its Sora 2 Generative AI model on their content.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">announcement</a> was made via Japan’s Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA), which represents anime, game and manga publishers from the country (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sonys-aniplex-bandai-namco-and-other-japanese-publishers-demand-end-to-unauthorized-training-of-openais-sora2-through-coda/">Automaton Media</a>).</p>
<p>CODA's statement insists that Sora 2 has been trained on copyrighted works from Japanese publishers, and that this “may constitute copyright infringement."</p>
<p>OpenAI has an opt-out system in place and has already had to change the way Sora 2 works in order to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y0g79xevxo">avoid certain content from being created</a>. However, CODA claims this approach is incompatible with Japan’s copyright laws and that prior permission is required.</p>

<p>CODA is now asking OpenAI to immediately stop using copyrighted content, and urges the American company to “respond sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."</p>
<p>Sora 2 launched at the end of October and immediately came under fire for allowing users to create videos containing a wide range of copyrighted material and characters, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">including those of Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>Established in order to build "safe and beneficial" AI systems, OpenAI has increasingly become embroiled in controversies over its use of Generative AI technology.</p>
<p>In 2024, Hollywood megastar <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm559l5g529o">Scarlett Johansson</a> accused the company of using her voice without permission.</p>
<p>Beyond copyright infringement, OpenAI has openly admitted that some of its users <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yd90g0q43o">exhibit psychosis or suicidal thoughts</a>, and is currently being sued by the parents of 16-year-old <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgerwp7rdlvo">Adam Raine</a>, who allege that its chatbot, ChatGPT, encouraged him to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Ahead of 'Wicked: For Good'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="706d691edd75b"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/706d691edd75b/super-mario-bros-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're itching to see what <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> will actually look like, then you might not have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>According to movie scoops outlet <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">My Time to Shine</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-next-mario-galaxy-movie-reveal-is-reportedly-coming-very-soon/">VGC</a>), the next trailer for the upcoming flick will be presented before showings for <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>. If accurate, this presumably means that the trailer will get its debut either on <strong>21st November</strong>, which is when Wicked: For Good releases, or at some point beforehand.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't sound like a very Nintendo move to just let the trailer play in theatres without any kind of build-up, so we'd imagine that there would be some sort of Direct showcase in which Miyamoto reveals the trailer himself, followed by Chris Pratt reiterating how much he just loves to stomp those darn Koopas.</p>

<p>Whether this claim is accurate or not, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is releasing on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, so Nintendo and Illumination will likely want to kick off the marketing campaign pretty soon.</p>
<p>The upcoming movie is a direct sequel to <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, which released back in 2023. Actors Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Charlie Day, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kevin Michael Richardson are all set to reprise their roles.</p>
<p>The movie's title was revealed during the most recent Nintendo Direct, during which the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> was recognised with several key announcements.</p>
