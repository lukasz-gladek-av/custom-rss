            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I'm not sure how many times I've played through the opening hours of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, but it's a lot, and it's been across a long period of time via various platforms.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that I've experienced this all-timer during phases of janky performance, and whilst it's a game that still shines, no matter the technical issues at hand, it's one that's all the more dreamy when it runs well and is, most importantly, easy to parse at all times.</p>
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a busy old thing in how it utilises every inch of your screen to convey info about everything that's going on at any given time, you see. There's a lot to digest, and having a nice crisp resolution, coupled with a frame rate that's smooth, really brings it all home as a remarkable achievement in gaming that everyone should dive into.</p>
<p>I gave the Switch 1 port a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">9/10 in my review of that version back in 2019</a>, remarking that "beyond a quite understandable drop in resolution and texture quality, this is [...] running at a solid and dependable 30fps". Ah, yes, that's right, this one already ran surprisingly well, so we're on easy street. Sort of.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:91617 @ 1765904262 -->
<p>Yes, we can put an end to a streak of properly awful Switch 2 ports (that's right, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, I am talking about you guys) by rejoicing in the fact that Larian has delivered a free update that, whilst bare-bones, gives us a much-improved experience overall. And that's what actually matters.</p>
<p>Whilst it's definitely a disappointment that we've only got 30fps in portable, and with no mouse mode added in to boot (I mean...why?!), the handheld 30fps here <em>is</em> the smooth-feeling sort, and it's also not the type of game that critically needs to be at 60fps, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In docked mode, it does now hit 60fps, though. Hooray! And it's stuck resolutely to 60fps throughout all of my time playing. It also — thanks to a resolution bump to 1080p — looks way clearer on-screen whilst benefitting from some lighting and shadow touch-ups. Oh, and loading times, thankfully, are way down here, so that's a very nice bonus. These are meaningful quality-of-life upgrades for players who've grown accustomed to long waits and blurry visuals on Switch 1 or anyone who's likely to pump a lot of time into this gem in the near future.</p>
<p>And so, overall, whilst this <em>is</em> as bare bones as these things get, it is free if you own the game already, and you can't argue that it ain't prettier, crisper, and better to play now, can you? Also, given that it's an all-timer for all times, well, they get away with it.</p>
<p>Now, where's Baldur's Gate 3? Didn't you guys know <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/baldurs-gate-3">I gave that a 10?</a> Make with the mind-flayers already.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Capcom has recently confirmed the worst kept secret of 2025 by finally showcasing Leon Kennedy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>However, the new trailer also contains a few lines of dialogue from another off-screen character, and fans are convinced that they know who it is. Ahead of Leon's reveal, we hear from a supporting character over comms, who provides information while asking questions regarding the events of Requiem.</p>
<p>Although it might be tempting to say that this is Ingrid Hunnigan, the agent who supported Leon over comms during the events of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">6</a>, comparisons to voiceover work in the latter entry have fans convinced that it's actually Sherry Birkin.</p>
<p>Sherry last appeared in Resident Evil 6 and featured prominently in Jake Muller's campaign, crossing paths with Leon during a bio-terror incident in China. She was voiced by Eden Riegel, and comparisons between her scenes in Resident Evil 6 and the voiceover heard in the Requiem trailer reveal that the voices sound <em>incredibly</em> similar.</p>

<p>In addition to the voiceover work, a very brief shot during the Requiem trailer shows someone viewing information on a screen whilst wearing a microphone – someone with very distinctive blonde hair.</p>
<p>It would make a lot of sense if this were indeed the case. Sherry became close friends with Leon and Claire Redfield during the events of Resident Evil 2, and later became an agent under the Division of Security Operations (D.O.S.), an entity that also happens to employ Leon.</p>
<p>So it seems likely, then, that Sherry Birkin will feature in Requiem. Will it stop there, though, or can we also expect to see more classic characters make their grand return? Heck, if Leon's in the game, then it's reasonable to assume we'll also catch a glimpse of Ada Wong.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll find out for sure when Resident Evil Requiem launches on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
