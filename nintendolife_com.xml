<p>It looks... okay?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Denis Dyack, the former president of Silicon Knights and director of games such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/blood_omen_legacy_of_kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a>, has revealed the latest look at <strong>Deadhaus Sonata</strong>, a new 'spiritual successor' to Blood Omen.</p>
<p>Originally announced back in 2018, there are no target platforms at the moment, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/">Steam</a> page is now live with more information on its Early Access release. Dyack has previously stated that Deadhaus Sonata will be coming to consoles, but given the sheer amount of time it's been in the works, we can't say for certain if this includes the Switch or Switch 2.</p>
<p>Looking at the gameplay footage, it looks... okay? It's hard to really parse exactly what's going on. There's a lot of hack and slash action being showcased, but there's quite a busy UI to go along with it, and we're not quite sure how everything functions. Early descriptions state that tarot cards can be used to customise your build, while loot is tied to your actions and performance, rather than being completely random.</p>
<p>Still, it's nice to be shown gameplay at all in this day and age, and we're certain Dyack will reveal more in the coming months.</p>
<p>Here's the official Steam description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Step into Malorum, a dark and crumbling world where the lines between life and death no longer hold. Deadhaus Sonata invites you to embrace the undead, master supernatural powers, and carve your place within a realm shaped by ancient forces, political intrigue, and the choices of its players. Play alone or join up to six players in cooperative play as you face the living and uncover the secrets that shape this fallen realm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bang for your buck</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Those who have played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a> know just how big of a game it really is. <a href="https://hundred-line.com/news/?id=69524">According to the publisher</a>, however, the release was actually two games in one, and that's supposedly how it's going to be marketed from now on.</p>
<p>Confused? Yeah don't worry, it's understandable. Effectively, once you complete 100 in-game days, you roll the credits and then commence 'New Game +' (although the title menu does, in fact, display 'The Hundred Line 2'), during which you make key decisions to splinter the narrative into dozens of potential branches.</p>
<p>So, the first 100 days is 'The Hundred Line', while the following narrative is 'The Hundred Line 2'. So there you go: it's now officially two games in one! So the title that launched last year is now being described as a 'value 1 &amp; 2 pack'.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, a new trailer has been released (above) to highlight the events that take place in the 'sequel', while a brand new piece of key art has been shared to demonstrate the two distinct narratives. Pardon the poor quality, it's the best we could find from an official source.</p>

<p>In addition, it's been confirmed that an official soundtrack is launching on all major streaming services on <strong>17th January 2026</strong>. A physical soundtrack will also be made available in April to mark the game's first anniversary. In Japan, meanwhile, a <a href="https://online.aniplex.co.jp/itemoazLMQxE.html">new special edition release</a> of the game will be made available from April, featuring brand new artwork to acknowledge the 'sequel'.</p>
