This is the GBC-looking Zelda-like from Yacht Club Games, the studio behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_treasure_trove">Shovel Knight</a>, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/shovel-knight-devs-new-game-mina-the-hollower-smashes-kickstarter-goal">launched on Kickstarter</a> back in 2022, and only recently missed out on its initial release date thanks to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/retro-zelda-inspired-adventure-mina-the-hollower-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-and-switch">last-minute delay</a>. It feels like it has been a long time coming, a fact that Yacht Club is reportedly painfully aware of.</p>
<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio founder Sean Velasco described Mina as "make-or-break" for the future of Yacht Club Games. In the time since Shovel Knight, the studio has downsized, faced a global pandemic and divided its teams into two — later reforged into one — and delays don't come cheap, either. “If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," Velasco told Bloomberg, "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good”.</p><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytW9fsZhwHLmM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbejgmzos&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>According to the report, the game's inception came back in 2019 by designer Alec Faulkner. Yacht Club initially split its staff into two teams — one focusing on Mina, and the other on a 3D Shovel Knight follow-up — though the former project quickly grew in ambition, with Faulkner reportedly struggling to operate as the game's director.</p>
<p>Seeing that the system wasn't working, the studio laid off some staff to cut expenses and re-combined the teams to focus purely on the Mina project, with Velasco stepping into the director role. According to artist Sandy Gordon, had the team stuck together right from the jump, "we would’ve finished it two to three years ago".</p>
<p>"If Mina flops, we'll still be around," Velasco told Bloomberg, though he's quick to clarify that they would "need more money". The studio is already taking steps to cut back on this front, moving fully remote at the end of the year and shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>From the little of Mina that we have seen so far, we remain cautiously optimistic that the full game will deliver the goods. There's a free demo now available on the eShop (sporting 120fps on Switch 2, no less), and it plays every bit as much like a 2D Zelda game as you would hope. A delay is never a welcome sight, but our fingers are crossed that we don't have to wait too long to see things hit their full potential.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5c76adae19fa1"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c76adae19fa1/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is very nearly here. It's so close, in fact, that the reviews for the Switch 2 version of the game have now gone live, letting us all find out what we can expect from Samus' long-awaited adventure on the latest hardware.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a blast with Beyond, calling it "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a snippet, followed by the full shebang, so you can check out our thoughts for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions. Separating the main biomes with a vast open world sounds ridiculous on paper, but the slick traversal provided by Vi-O-La makes exploration more satisfying than ever</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194214 @ 1764699039 -->
<p>But we're not the only review out there! Below, we've rounded up a handful of reviews from across the internet to give you a snapshot of the range of opinions on display. We predicted that this might be a rather divisive one in our review, and divisive it has been...</p>
<p>Kicking things off with a full beans 10/10 from <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/1900-805/">Giant Bomb</a>, where the outlet describes Prime 4 as "one of [Samus'] greatest adventures":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time will tell where I place Metroid Prime 4 in the ranking of the overall series, but fresh off my first playthrough, I feel comfortable putting it among the likes of Super Metroid and the original Metroid Prime</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>With a similar score to us, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Game Informer</a> awarded Prime 4 an 8.75 out of 10, praising just about everything the game has to offer, but feeling let down by the finale and save shenanigans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond maintains the high standard set by previous games in the series with incredible atmosphere and subtle touches that make the planet of Viewros look and sound real, but it is not without a handful of annoyances that hinder the immersion</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">TechRadar Gaming</a> opted for a similar 4/5, and while the outlet seemed up on the story and "gorgeous" visuals, its big sticking point came in the open-field desert area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the desert was a touch smaller, and there were a few extra rooms to explore in each biome, it'd be on its way to sitting alongside the first two Prime games in quality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things dropped ever so slightly for <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">GamesRadar+</a>, whose 3.5 review similarly struggled with the "padding" of the overworld, even amidst the excellent levels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within its actual levels, Metroid Prime 4 is triumphant, delivering immersive first-person exploration like nothing else in the genre, with some of the greatest levels in the series to date, dripping with potent atmosphere. But outside of those, Metroid Prime 4 is such a drag, and actively gets in the way of reaching those heights</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">VGC</a> went for a 3/5, describing Prime 4 as "a game stuck between two worlds", as it tries to keep the series' backbone while trying something new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it’s emulating the series’ past, Beyond is an entertaining, if overly conservative, sequel. However, as the shadowy corridors make way for open-world fetch quests, and Halo-style expeditions with AI companions, it’s left feeling like a diluted experience that doesn’t fully deliver on the spirit of earlier entries</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer</a> also went for a 3/5, feeling let down by the game's ending and chatty companions, despite its high points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter how much you enjoy the gameplay part, I don't think there's much more disappointing than finishing a game that's relatively narratively-driven and thinking, "that's it?" at the credits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pretty large spread, no? At the time of writing, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metacritic</a> score of 80, based on 63 reviews. We'll have to wait a little while longer to see how things fare on Switch 1, but rest assured, we'll have our impressions on the old hardware release with you before long.</p>

<figure data-uuid="010b934aad0e4"><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/010b934aad0e4/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/switch-2-exclusive-drag-x-drive-scores-its-second-major-update-heres-whats-included">a rather beefy update earlier today</a>, and to coincide with Patch 1.2.0's release, Nintendo has dropped a series of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-1/">Ask the Developer interviews</a> with the lead trio.</p>
<p>Yoshinori Konishi (director and programming director), Hiroki Hamaue (programmer), and Takahisa Ikejiri (art director) sat down to share their experience in developing this online multiplayer title, which is controlled entirely with the Switch 2's Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-1/">Part 1</a>, Konishi shares that the game was inspired by "sports such as wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, BMX and skateboarding", particularly the former. Hamaue had previously rode a wheelchair "for a research project back when I was a student", but for Konishi and Ikejiri, the first time they got to experience wheelchair basketball was at an experience in Osaka.</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytepMKq3hLRsg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0pumzsq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<figure data-uuid="3dabc2054903f"><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3dabc2054903f/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The developers purchased both an everyday wheelchair and sports wheelchair to help with the process. But the problem was that, as Konishi says, "We were restricted to the small space inside the office and could only let loose down the hallway once everyone else had gone home for the day. (Laughs)" because the project was tightly under wraps.</p>
<p>Talking about the wheelchair basketball experience, Ikejiri recalls that he "wasn't prepared for how difficult it was to shoot the ball. In wheelchair basketball, the hoop is placed at the same height as in standard basketball. But since you take the shot sitting down, my shot didn't reach the basket at all."</p>
<p>"Maneuvering a wheelchair is difficult unless you get the hang of when to apply and release force," Hamaue adds. "You can't just propel yourself along smoothly in a single stroke. But it cemented for me how deep the controls are".</p>

<p>As well as trying out wheelchair basketball for themselves, Konishi details the variety of reading materials the team gathered up: "From an encyclopedia of wheelchairs to videos and essays by wheelchair athletes and even manga about basketball or wheelchairs, we pulled together as much reference material as we could lay our hands on and studied it together."</p>
<p>And, crucially, wheelchair basketball players also got a chance to go hands-on with Drag x Drive during development, which provided Konishi and the rest with valuable insights: "Because the players use wheelchairs in their daily lives, they were all really good at turning and moving backwards in the game. Of course, we learned a lot about the controls, but we gained even more insights watching them think about what to do on the court as they played."</p>
<p>Hamaue adds that "seeing actual wheelchair basketball players get the hang of the game and its controls so quickly confirmed to us that it could work well as an intuitive control scheme." And we'd agree; there's nothing else quite like Drag x Drive on the market, and while its control scheme may not be for everyone, it makes for a unique experience.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-3/">three parts</a> contain video clips and test footage of Drag x Drive's development, and are worth reading especially if you're interested in checking out the new update. Perhaps it's time to dive back and try out Survival Tag mode as the Holidays approach...</p>
