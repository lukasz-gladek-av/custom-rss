In this particular case, we're actually referring to Piggyback's upcoming art book '<strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>'.</p>
<p>This book, developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, was originally scheduled to launch in Summer 2025 and then <a href="https://x.com/PiggybackGuides/status/1894447510669705488">narrowed down the date to 24th June 2025</a>, but has now been pushed back to <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. <a href="https://www.piggyback.com/us/guide/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective/">Pre-orders have also gone live</a> since our last update.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>When this art book eventually releases, Metroid fans can look forward to a 212-page visual retrospective that goes behind the scenes on the series' development including a foreword by Metroid Prime producer Kensuke Tanabe.</p>
<p>This book will retail for <strong>£39.99 / €44.99</strong> and you can find out more about it in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, it's currently set to arrive at some point in 2025, with Nintendo also recently revealing a Switch 2 version which will enhance the experience and also add some additional features like mouse control.</p>

<p>Breaking records in less than a week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a6181ef1adbe/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo shared its first official sales data for the Switch 2 – confirming the new hybrid system had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide"</a> in just the first four days, making it the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware within this amount of time.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the video game firm has revealed this new device is also the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware in the US" in four days. This was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">reported by IGN</a> – with the outlet also told "Switch 2 sales in all regions were approximately twice those of the Nintendo Switch 1 across both consoles' first four days on the market". Nintendo has not provided specific sales figures for this region.</p>
<p>This follows reports about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">system's positive start in locations like the UK</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">and Japan</a>. Unsurprisingly, the launch is also benefiting certain franchises such as Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which has now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">surpassed five million lifetime sales</a> just a week later.</p>
<p>It's still early days for the Switch 2, and there were obviously some concerns about pricing and supply in the lead-up, but based on the official sales updates so far, it appears to be an excellent start. Nintendo will bolster the new device's software library next month with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and it's likely to welcome even more consumers to the Switch 2 family with games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> later this year.</p>
