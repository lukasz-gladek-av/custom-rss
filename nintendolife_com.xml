<p>We went tactical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift-ds">last week</a>, as we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> on the DS, and it's got to be said, the results were the most one-sided we've seen in a long time. The bright European / Japanese version took home a staggering 90% of the vote, leaving the bland North American variant with a measly 10%. <em>Oof</em>.</p>
<p>With a new Yoshi game on the horizon, we're throwing it back to one of the delightful dino's most beloved entries (in the handheld space, at least), as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>. Those with a good memory might remember us tackling the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/poll_box_art_brawl_duel_55_-_super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">SNES original</a> way back in 2020, but the GBA version comes with a pair of covers all of its own, so let's take a look at them.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fjzlsox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0d7b39a2a9d7d"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d7b39a2a9d7d/sma-yoshis-island-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European and North American cover will be instantly familiar to those who remember the SNES layout. It sees Yoshi and Baby Mario merrily making their way across the island as a giant Nep-Enut emerges from the water behind them. It's clean, it's colourful, it's iconic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="3d1c930803cc2"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d1c930803cc2/sma-yoshis-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flipside, the Japanese design opts for something far less level-based. Baby Mario and Yoshi still take centre stage, but they are instead surrounded by a bunch of other Yoshis, all decked out in different pastel colours to stress the multiplayer potential. The pink background might not tell you quite as much about a typical level structure as the NA/EU cover, but it is really rather cute.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The Dragon Ball series is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, and as part of a special '<a href="https://youtu.be/SkH1AHJDW6E">Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri</a>' event this week, Bandai Namco has shared some video game announcements.</p>
<p>First up, there's <a href="https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_3963.html">"breaking news"</a> regarding the latest game in the works. It's the official announcement of the new game project "<strong>AGE 1000</strong>". This title, which will get an official name at a later date, has been in development for "about 6 to 7 years now including the initial concept phase". It features a new "never-before-seen world and characters" from legend and series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/akira-toriyama-the-dragon-ball-dragon-quest-and-chrono-trigger-artist-that-inspired-the-world">creator Akira Toriyama</a>, who passed away in 2024.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Toriyama-sensei has been heavily involved in this AGE1000 project, in its world-building, characters, and many other aspects."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AGE 1000 is currently "set for 2027", although no platforms have been revealed at this point in time. As for the details about this story, the team was willing to say much at this stage, but 'AGE' refers to the year in the Dragon Ball world. There's already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1qm6ekl/comment/o1jvyhv/">plenty of speculation</a> about the game as well.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball fans can expect more information about this game at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which kicks off in April.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2df8bce7b51fc"><a title="Dragon Ball Age 1000" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2df8bce7b51fc/dragon-ball-age-1000.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some other Dragon Ball video game news, Bandai Namco and Spike Chunsoft have announced new "major" DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a>. More details about the Switch and Switch 2 release will be revealed in the future. For now, here's a brief description and trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Super Saiyan Bardock, Super Android 17 (GT), Great Demon King Piccolo, and more will be joining the lineup of playable characters! Plus, customizations for skills and outfits, new stages, and a new single player mode are planned to be added!</p>
<p>This fabulous DLC is scheduled for release on PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and STEAM® in summer 2026, with more details on the Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2 release to come!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahead of this new DLC, there'll also be some free updates. This includes 'Mission 100' mode ("where you use your favourite characters to challenge and clear various missions") and 'Survival Mode'. The 'Mission 100' mode will arrive on 26th January 2026 on other platforms, and 'Survival Mode' is currently scheduled for Spring.</p>
<p>This new DLC will arrive later on the Switch and Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hero-of-justice-pack-70050000060002-switch/">DLC 1</a> also scheduled for Winter 2026 and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dragon-ball-daima-character-pack-1-70050000060109-switch/">DLC 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dlc-3-70050000060111-switch/">DLC 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-shallot-dragon-ball-legends-70050000060113-switch/">Extra DLC</a> arriving in Spring 2026. You can see the full roadmap in the image below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Please note that the release schedule for both the major DLC and the free update on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 will differ from other platforms. We appreciate your patience."</p>

<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mysims_cozy_bundle">MySims Cozy Bundle</a>, there's reportedly been a new EA survey sent out to select Sims players, and it's believed to be hinting at a new MySims game for the Switch and other platforms.</p>
<p>It apparently suggests the game would be a "cozy, collaborative adventure simulation" title where players can "explore a whimsical world, customize their village, befriend residents &amp; pets, and uncover delightful secrets".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067myzixo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>This title would supposedly offer solo play and multiplayer with "up to four friends". Many <a href="https://simscommunity.info/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/new-mysims-game-features.jpg">other features are listed</a>, too. This latest development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-removed-ea-app-listings-suggest-more-mysims-revivals-might-be-on-the-horizon">discovery of some MySims game listings</a> in January last year.</p>
<p>Following the release of MySims on the Switch, EA's CEO Andrew Wilson mentioned how the Cozy Bundle had performed "well ahead" of the third-party giant's expectations.</p>
<p>In our review, we gave the Switch bundle seven out of ten stars and said the titles were still engaging and easygoing spin-offs.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> series is currently celebrating 30 years, and it seems an announcement could be taking place soon.</p>
<p>A new rating has appeared on the Australian Classification Board for <strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong>. The classification took place on 22nd January 2026. Additional details list Atari as the developer and publisher, and UI Entertainment as the applicant.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee436245b45a"><a title="Rayman - Game Boy Color Box Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee436245b45a/rayman-game-boy-color-box-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ubisoft kicked off Rayman's 30th anniversary celebrations last September and it followed with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">rumours about a Rayman Remake</a>.</p>
<p>The original 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> platformer launched in 1995. On Nintendo platforms, this eventually followed with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/eshop/rayman_gbc">Game Boy Color version</a>, a Game Boy Advance port, and years later <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/dsiware/rayman">Rayman</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/12/rayman_dsiware">for DSiWare</a>. In December last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> was added to the Switch Online's Nintendo 64 library.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6jpzmuw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>This rating follows news of Ubisoft's major organisational restructure. Rayman has been confirmed as being part of the company's future plans. Its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">creative house 'CH4'</a> will be responsible for the IP and other "narrative adventure" series such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time">Prince of Persia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/beyond_good_and_evil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</p>
