            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hitman_absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> is widely regarded as the ‘black sheep’ of the series thanks to its focus on cinematic storytelling over player freedom. This is very much still the case with this fresh release on Switch from Feral Interactive, but now that original developer IO Interactive has righted the ship with the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">World of Assassination</a> trilogy, it’s much easier to look back on Absolution and better appreciate it for what it is – kind of like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>.</p>
<p>Does that mean it’s perfect? No, far from it. But it’s a fascinating detour for Agent 47 that still provides ample fun while laying foundations for later titles, including the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>.</p>
<p>Like previous entries, Absolution requires you to locate your targets and dispatch them with as little fuss as possible (while constantly evading the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/po-po">po-po</a>). Nailing a high stealth rating is what it’s all about, but if you prefer to go in guns blazing, that’s an option. Otherwise, sneaky little ‘accidents’ are often the best course of action, and you can activate Instinct Mode to highlight enemies, items, and traps to help formulate a plan.</p>
<p>Disguises let you access areas that might otherwise be off-limits, but many of the guards can see through your outfits (not literally, cheeky) and discover your true identity. Instinct Mode comes into play here too, so by holding down ‘R’ while in an enemy's line of sight, you can make yourself inconspicuous enough to slip by.</p>
<p>Unlike World of Assassination, Instinct Mode is finite. Relying on it too much will deplete your supplies. Taking out guards and completing challenges will replenish it, but I advise using it sparingly and instead rely on your own senses to scope out opportunities; it’s much more fun that way.</p>
<p>Levels are overall smaller and more compact than what you might be used to. IO Interactive focuses a lot more on telling a coherent story, and it shows in the structure. In other Hitman titles, you’d spend a lot of time walking out in the open and blending into your surroundings, but in Absolution, sneaking around and hiding behind cover is generally more advisable thanks to the close-quarters environments.</p>
<p>This frustrated a lot of folks back in 2012, and the game was widely criticised for its overall linearity when compared to earlier entries. This hasn’t changed, but there’s still a decent amount of options available when deciding how to approach your targets. Know what you’re getting yourself into and you’ll have a good time.</p>
<p>Performance is exactly what I imagined it would be. You’re looking at 30fps with a few minor hitches here and there, particularly in dense crowds. Textures and assets have also been scaled back considerably, but it’s still a handsome game regardless, and the accompanying music is consistently great.</p>
<p>Feral has promised a free Switch 2 upgrade in 2026 along with an extra Contracts Mode, so if you’re happy to wait until then, then by all means do so. But Hitman: Absolution on Switch is solid, flaws and all.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hitman-absolution]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock.1354582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="61ffe6b0cd8e7"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61ffe6b0cd8e7/nintendo-switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the introduction of the OLED model, there's been an Ethernet port built into the dock of Nintendo's flagship Switch, and that continued this year with Switch 2. If you're after the fastest download speeds or you play competitive online games while docked to your TV, you may benefit from wiring up your dock to your router directly.</p>
<p>However, since launch back in June, we've seen reports of players having issues with wired internet connections. Some point to the Realtek port as the culprit, others think it's a specific firmware or software glitch, or a USB-C-related handshake issue where something periodically goes awry. But whatever the reason, there seems to be a group for whom Switch 2's Ethernet port just isn't functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Asking around the NL office, it's blank faces, (un)fortunately. Either a wireless connection is sufficient and we haven't ever bothered wiring up the dock, or we just haven't experienced any issues.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/ethernet_port_on_switch_2_docks_failing_for_many_people">our forums</a> and <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/some-switch-2-ethernet-docks-are-malfunctioning.14103/">the wider internet</a> are filled with people who have had issues. Some have sent their docks back to Nintendo with varying degrees of success; others have found that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l6q47u/comment/n1rse3p">connecting their phones via a USB cable</a> somehow resets the chip and managed to get their Ethernet back up and running, if only temporarily.</p>

<p>Naturally, Nintendo has its error codes and <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68592">related pages</a>, but assuming that using a different Ethernet cable doesn't solve your problem, opening up a report ticket with Nintendo is the only option they're offering.</p>
<p>Obviously, this issue will be frustrating if it impacts you, but we're keen to get a sense of just how many people this is affecting. As with any electronic device, there'll be a percentage of failures or manufacturing faults that crop up that'll need attention, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">10.36 million people</a> (and counting) picking up a Switch 2 in the first few months, there are bound to be some malfunctioning units - but how widespread is the problem?</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll below if you've experienced any issues with a wired internet connection - and if / how you've solved the problem.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1752ef6450e0d"><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1752ef6450e0d/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you can turn your attention away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> for one moment, it seems we might have the very first leak from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>The Legend of Zelda Movie</strong></a> set.</p>
<p>While very little has been revealed about the film so far, it was confirmed earlier this month that the live-action is officially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">"in production" in New Zealand</a>. Now, in an update this week, footage has supposedly emerged of the production, including some clips featuring cast members and the film crew.</p>
<p>This is where this rumour possibly enters <strong>spoiler territory</strong>, so if you don't want any surprises ahead of official updates, navigate away from this page now. Right, with the spoiler warning out of the way, the first video that's been uploaded on Instagram shows two characters in a forest, surrounded by horses (with one horse equipped with some gear featuring what looks to be the Hylian Crest).</p>

<p>The first actor is believed to be Bo Bragason as Zelda, who is dressed in an outfit that looks similar to her clothing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, and the second actor (who we haven't heard about up until now) is apparently the Aussie and Tibetan actress Dichen Lachman, known for her current role in the Apple TV+ exclusive, Severance. She's also previously worked with director Wes Ball on Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.</p>
<p>As for who she is playing? Based on the footage, fans are already convinced she'll be Impa. Long-time Zelda players will know Impa is a recurring character in the Zelda series, who has been depicted as the bodyguard and mentor of the Princess.</p>
<p>The second scene doing the rounds looks to feature an older version of the series' protagonist Link in his green tunic, which he has appeared in across multiple games, including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess</a>. The footage in this upload even shows him putting on a cloak, and some fans think his horse Epona is also on display in the other clip.</p>

<p>We'd be surprised if the original clips stay up if they are the real deal. Of course, for now, it's probably best to treat this supposed leak as a rumour, but we will say the footage certainly looks the part, and casting someone from across the ditch (<em>aka Australia</em>) would check out, given the location of the production.</p>
<p>Apart from Zelda's casting, the only other actor officially confirmed for the Legend of Zelda Movie is Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. As for the story, some basic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-in-production-in-new-zealand">descriptions have popped up online</a>, but that's about it. This live-action film is currently scheduled to arrive in cinemas in <strong>May 2027</strong>, and you can find out more about it in our guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>
