<p>Amy Mars? Veronica Rose?</p>

<figure data-uuid="92a82647796ce"><a title="Sonic the Hedgehog Amy Rose &amp; Kristen Bell" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/92a82647796ce/sonic-the-hedgehog-amy-rose-and-kristen-bell.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The next <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> movie is set to be a big one, with even more classic characters coming back, one of which is everyone's favourite pink hedgehog, Amy Rose. And we now know which Hollywood star will be voicing the iconic character</p>
<p>Revealed by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Kristen Bell, best known from <strong>Veronica Mars</strong>, <strong>Frozen</strong>, <strong>The Good Place</strong>, and <strong>Gossip Girl</strong>, will be taking up the piko piko hammer.</p>
<p>She'll be joining Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and Keanu Reeves (Shadow) — assuming these all return — among many other star-studded names, when <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</strong> speeds onto cinema screens on 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>In fact, Schwartz shared a rather adorable photo of the pair on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6JVK4lBLA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">his instagram account</a> earlier today, accompanied by this sweet little celebration: "WE HAVE OUR AMY ROSE!!! And I could not be more excited!!! Please welcome the incredible @kristenanniebell to the @sonicmovie family!!!"</p>

<p>Amy was expected to appear in fourth Sonic movie after a very brief cameo during <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</strong>. Metal Sonic is also rumoured after he featured during the same cameo, but we don't have an official announcement for his return yet.</p>
<p>And it seems like everyone is coming back for the sequel: Jeff Fowler will remain in the director's chair, while Neal H. Moritz and Toby Ascher of Original Films and Toru Nakahara are also on-board as producers.</p>
<p>And the Sonic series isn't stopping at another numbered movie, either. Late last year, Variety reported that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/new-sonic-universe-movie-spin-off-announced-for-2028">a new 'Sonic Universe' spin-off is in the works for 2028</a>. So the blue blur is steadily becoming a multi-media monster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4e70039ba7b4f"><a title="GameCube Grip Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e70039ba7b4f/gamecube-grip-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo launched its dedicated GameCube NSO pad alongside the Switch 2 last year, undoubtedly providing the best experience for docked play. However, much like the N64 pad before it, the controller doesn't do much to help with handheld play, where the Joy-Con 2 button layouts simply can't capture the <em>feel</em> of the original hardware.</p>
<p>Enter abxylute's N9C, a Switch 2 grip that launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/abxylute-n9-n6-full-size-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2?ref=7yzisn">Kickstarter</a> today and was almost immediately fully funded, which looks as close as we'll ever get to a GameCube pad built for handheld play.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/crkd-nitro-deck-for-nintendo-switch-almost-great-but-with-one-major-flaw">CRKD's Nitro Deck range</a>, this is a grip that sits around the Switch 2 screen, substituting the usual Joy-Con placement for one half of the 'split' pad. It attaches via the console's bottom USB-C port to keep the button inputs super snappy, boasts swappable joystick gates for both 8-way and circular options, supports gyro controls <em>and</em> has four extra buttons on the back for you to remap as you please.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, it nails the look of the GameCube pad. Sure, anything in that shade of purple is bound to bring the nostalgia, and the d-pad and stick tops are a <em>little</em> off from the original design (if we're really being picky), but it's difficult to knock that face button placement when we start to think about the prospect of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> on the go.</p>

<p>If those violet tones are enough of a throwback for you, and you can do away with the GC's asymmetrical button layout, abxylute is also launching its N6 grip for a slightly more conventional look. This one packs in hall-effect joysticks, front-facing speakers, remappable buttons, gyro support and more. It might not be quite as nostalgic as the N9C offering, but it certainly looks comfier for extended handheld play sessions than the standard Joy-Con setup.</p>
<p>This one comes in either black or purple colourways, so you can choose how much of a throwback you want.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, both grips are only up for Kickstarter support at the time of writing, though early backers will have access to "a Super Early Bird price before full retail availability". You can pledge $618 HKD (around £59 / $79) for one of the N6 grips with an expected April 2026 delivery, or $696 HKD (roughly £66 / $89) for a N9C unit with an estimated June delivery during this early period</p>
