<figure data-uuid="015b8a88187d1"><a title="Pokemon LeafGreen GBA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/015b8a88187d1/pokemon-leafgreen-gba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The news that the GBA Gen 1 refreshes, Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen, are coming to Switch next week has gotten us excited this morning, but it's also raised some questions with fans.</p>
<p>How come these games aren't coming to Nintendo Switch Online like the other GBA games in the Expansion Pack? Will I be able to trade? Will we be seeing more Virtual Console-style releases like this?</p>
<p>Well, preempting all those questions, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71365/#s1q4">Nintendo of America has put out a FAQ</a> answering all those and more.</p>
<p>On the question of why these GBA games are being handled differently from others available on NSO, the article says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also addressed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>"</em><em>Online play is not supported."</em></strong></li>
<li><em><strong>"The games will not receive physical releases"</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>"We have nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles"</strong></em> (re. whether Red, Blue, or other Pokémon games may come to NSO in the future)</li>
<li><em><strong>"We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online"</strong></em> (re. whether further standalone retro releases are planned)</li>
<li><em><strong>"We thought users will appreciate the ultimate versions of those original adventures"</strong></em> (re. why these aren't the OG Game Boy versions)</li>
</ul>
<p>On other pages beyond this FAQ, <strong>support for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> is confirmed</strong> to be on the way, and <strong>these games won't work with NSO Save Data Cloud backup</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll reproduce the entire FAQ below for your perusal:</p>

</ul>
<hr>

<p>So, it seems NOA tried to head the big questions off at the pass.</p>
<p>With the games priced at £16.99 / $19.99 each, and with all those separately listed language variants opening further possibilities for confusion, it seems wise to answer the biggest head-scratchers before a barrage of clarification requests from press and fans alike. The language version thing, in particular, seems more complicated than necessary, but hey, we'd expect no less.</p>
<p><em>Has NOA answered your main questions here? Let us know below if you're looking forward to a return trip to Kanto on Switch next week.</em></p>

<p>Still just a download code, mind</p>

It's a cause for celebration, of course, but there's a part of us that can't help but feel a pang of envy after realising that Japan is getting treated to a '<a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/switch-frlg/lineup/">Special Edition</a>' physical release, too.</p>
<p>We use "physical" hesitantly there, because it seems that this boxed release is still reliant on its included download code if you actually want to, you know, play the game. That said, it's a beauty.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fhnmjpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The Special Edition includes two reproductions of the original Japanese GBA cases, and a rather swanky trio of laser-engraved glass balls with Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle inside. Putting these balls on their respective stand in the included display case, lets them light up in a fitting green/red/blue hue. <em>Oof</em>.</p>


<p>This release will be available from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html">Japanese Pokémon Center online store</a> from <strong>Saturday, 28th February</strong>. Both the FireRed and LeafGreen versions (the only difference being the contents of the download code) will set you back <strong>19,800 yen</strong> — which is roughly <strong>£95 / $127</strong>, <em>gulp</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this is a Japan-only release, with TPC saying that it <em>might</em> be available at physical Pokémon Centers at a later date. So... still Japan-only. Hey, let's keep those fingers crossed for a Western launch at some point down the line, eh?</p>

<p>Of course, TPC isn't celebrating any old birthday this year. 2026 marks the series' 30th anniversary, so we're cautiously optimistic that there might be a surprise or two in store for us during the show (alongside all of the usual app updates, of course). Gen 10 feels like a no-brainer, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed and LeafGreen</a> are already confirmed, but could there be <em>more</em>? Don't worry, we've got the clown makeup on standby.</p>

<p>Coming next week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has seemingly revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> for the Switch earlier than planned, as a whole bunch of eShop listings are now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/english-pokemon-firered-version-switch/">live on the eShop</a>. <em>[Update: The reveal has now been officially announced - see the trailer below.]</em></p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each with a launch date of <strong>27th February</strong> (Pokémon Day, of course), the release has bypassed Nintendo Switch Online entirely, meaning you can own the games digitally à la carte. There will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-is-getting-a-stunning-special-edition-release-in-japan">a 'physical' edition in Japan</a>, although the game itself will still be a code-in-box. Nintendo of America has put out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">a FAQ</a> saying that these games "will not receive physical releases".</p>
<p>Releasing FireRed and LeafGreen is a pretty big move to acknowledge Pokémon's 30th anniversary, much like the launch of classic titles on the 3DS almost 10 years ago for the 20th celebrations.</p>
<p>Each language version of the game is available as a separate download, so beware if you're pre-ordering on the eShop and get the language you want!</p>

<p>The titles will be available shortly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">a Pokémon Presents showcase</a> on the 27th, so we'll be sure to keep an eye out for any further anniversary announcements from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p><em>For now, let us know in the comments whether you plan on picking up either Pokémon FireRed or LeafGreen (or both!).</em></p>

<p>Beat 'em up with "Bimmy &amp; Friends"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The 2D pixel beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a> continues to add new characters, and in the "largest character update yet", it's now added four more fighters.</p>
<p>Each character in this free "<strong>Bimmy &amp; Friends DLC</strong>" brings a new face, new personality, and a new fighting style to the city - allowing players to experiment with "powerful tag-team" combos. Here's the rundown about and you can see each fighter in action in the trailer above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Armored Okada</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the Oyabun of the Okada Clan, Lady Okada faces constant discrimination from the elders. When a powerful threat emerged, the elders presented her with the sacred clan armor - a challenge disguised as support. If she triumphs, she earns their respect. If she fails, she proves them right.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jackson</strong></p>
<p>A heavyweight boxer known for his lightning-fast jabs and devastating uppercuts. Once too strong for the ring, he grew bored of rules and regulations. Seeking greater thrills, he turned to the streets, where his power and skill made him a prized asset for every gang.</p>

<p><strong>Jim Mackey</strong></p>
<p>The younger brother of M.G. Willy, Jim respects his brother but refuses to live in his shadow. Determined to become his own man, he dreams of leading his own gang. To set himself apart, he wields a shotgun - the opposite of Willy’s machine gun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bimmy Lee</strong></p>
<p>Legends speak of a secret within the Sōsetsuken - a form that can only be mastered by two. The tale has been passed down for so long that few believe it, dismissing it as myth or joke. But could this be the proof…?</p>
