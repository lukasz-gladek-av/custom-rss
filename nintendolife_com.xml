<p>With a 7CD physical release in the works</p>

<figure data-uuid="4bfd593560611"><a title="Shujinkou Soundtrack" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bfd593560611/shujinkou-soundtrack.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Rice Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> surprised us all when it arrived on Switch in October, bringing its unique blend of dungeon-crawling RPG mechanics and the chance to learn Japanese through combat to the hybrid system after launching elsewhere in February. Now developer Rice Games is keeping the educational odyssey going with a release for the game's lengthy soundtrack, which recently went on sale as a digital download.</p>
<p>Popping up on <a href="https://ricegames.bandcamp.com/album/shujinkou-original-soundtrack">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098430/Shujinkou_Original_Soundtrack/">Steam</a>, and the <a href="https://ricegames.net/product/shujinkou-original-soundtrack-digital/">Rice Games store</a> for <strong>£19.99 / $25</strong>, the soundtrack comprises a whopping 158 tracks for almost seven hours of dungeon-crawling tunes. Lead composer Brian LaGuardia packs a bit of everything in there, too, with battle themes, character motifs, and minigame tunes spanning genres from classical to metal, rock to jazz.</p>
<p>All this comes from an orchestra of more than a dozen live performers, with the collection mastered by <a href="https://vgmdb.net/artist/13760">Ryuichi Tanaka</a> of Warner Music Japan — the same mastering engineer that you'll find on numerous Pokémon music collections.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, you can also stream the full collection on the likes of Spotify, Amazon, and YouTube, and there's a physical release on the horizon, too, with a seven-CD Collector's Edition planned to launch at some point in 2026. No word on price yet, but keep an eye out for that one.</p>

<p>If you missed it, Shujinkou is a dungeon-crawler that gives you the chance to learn Japanese as you play. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/shujinkou-has-been-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">A patch at the end of October</a> added a Visual Fidelity mode, which improved the presentation on Switch 2, as well as fixing some other issues. We've recently added expanded impressions to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shujinkou">our review</a> of the game, so if you like the sound of this unusual language-learning RPG, check it out.</p>

<figure data-uuid="f91587d6942cf"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91587d6942cf/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>With just one week to go before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> arrives on Switch 2, Ubisoft has updated the game's eShop page with some noteworthy details to keep in mind before you buy. Like, for example, the dreaded file size.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Assassin-s-Creed-Shadows-2967695.html">updated listing</a>, Shadows will take up a beefy <strong>62.8 GB</strong> on your system. It's not the most surprising news considering the size of the game, but it's something to keep an eye on as we head towards release.</p>
<p>For reference, this file size puts Shadows above the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> (60.6 GB), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a> (57.1 GB), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> (45.3 GB), but it's still a good step below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> (69.2 GB) and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> (90-95 GB). Not the end of the world, then, but it might be time to start looking for a Micro SD Express, if you're hoping to have a couple of these in your library.</p>
<p>For those who missed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/its-official-assassins-creed-shadows-comes-to-switch-2-in-december-with-cross-progression">initial announcement</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December</strong>, complete with cross-progression saves, touchscreen support and all the title updates you could wish for — apart from the Claws of Awaji expansion, you'll have to wait until 2026 for that.</p>

<p>The surprise sequel to the under-appreciated GameCube racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> has performed much better than its 2003 predecessor, boosted by fantastic visuals and performance, a plethora of characters and stages, and so many custom vehicles.</p>
<p>It's an absolute blast with friends, and our very own PJ O'Reilly agrees, scoring the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">an 8/10</a>, summing up that "This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards."</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adkymhgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>It's a fantastic comeback, and yet another feather in Kirby's cap; seems the pink puffball can do little wrong on the Switch and Switch 2. We've <em>always</em> loved him, of course. But what about you lovely folks?</p>
<p>Yes, we want to hear what you think of Kirby Air Riders on Switch 2. Have you been blitzing through it all weekend and have some strong thoughts on it? Or have you just dabbled and want to put more time into it? You can give the game a score below and, if you change your mind later, come back and do just that!</p>
