<p>Nothing mid(field) about this</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Just one month after launch, Level-5 has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>'s <em>monster</em> 'Galaxy &amp; LBX DLC' free update will arrive next week on <strong>21st December</strong>.</p>
<p>The studio released a beefy four-minute trailer (above) showcasing all of the good stuff that you can expect to find in the new update, but we'll do our best to run through the highlights here too.</p>
<p>Kicking off with that titular 'Galaxy &amp; LBX' content, the update adds new characters from <strong>Inazuma Eleven Galaxy</strong> and Level-5's <strong>Danball Senki</strong> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/lbx_little_battlers_experience">Little Battlers Experience</a>) series. There's a galactic new storyline that will see you playing across various planetary stadiums, each with its own unique effects, to become the best team in the universe — hey, the series has never been afraid of going OTT.</p>
<p>Speaking of OTT, new transform abilities will let your players grow into huge beasts and unleash their skills on the pitch, which sure is... something.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, you can expect new Chronicle routes, a 'Re-Story' mode to continue levelling up your players after wrapping up the main adventure, bonus BB Stadium teams, a two-player 'Tag Mode', tweaks to the Commander Mode, a new 'Fabled' character rarity and more.</p>
<p>In short, it's a lot, and it adds to what was already an impressively deep base game, which we called "the franchise’s most premium experience yet" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>. Whether adding <em>even more</em> will actually benefit the core experience remains to be seen, but at least we don't have long to wait until we can find out.</p>

<p>Multiple revived and enhanced titles are on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nitrome, the talented British indie developer currently crafting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> for the Switch 2, has this week announced a new series.</p>
<p>Nitrome Classics revives a range of titles from <a href="https://www.nitrome.com/">Nitrome's past</a> and is "lovingly" porting them to the Nintendo Switch and other platforms with various enhancements and updates. More platform releases could also "potentially" follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All of the games are not just meticulously restored but improved with higher frame rates, full screen aspect ratios and with higher quality music. Many of the games will be packaged as mini collections within a franchise and include additional content not found in the original release."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game in this series is <strong>Twin Shot Deluxe</strong> (a title which began life on web browsers), and it will be released in "early" 2026. <strong>Silly Sausage</strong> and <strong>Skywire</strong> will follow this game. Here are the details about the first title on the way (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618520/Twin_Shot_Deluxe/">via Steam</a>), and you can check out a trailer of this new Classics series above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Angel Cats are back and better than ever before in this complete remaster.</p>
<p><em>Twin Shot Deluxe</em> is an arcade platform shooter where players defend their homeland from invaders using bows and arrows. Take aim at over 200 brand new levels set across four worlds, each with unique challenges, bosses and enemies. Play solo or team up with friends in local cooperative play (one-to-four players) or play competitively to see who will be crowned champion.</p>
<p>A brand new Atlantis theme to explore, defeat additional bosses, unlock fancy headwear with special powers for extended replay, and much more… relive your childhood and take to the skies!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can also expect new bosses, cheats as well as a graphical overhaul – including a frame rate and resolution update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We could not leave the game lagging in the past at 20 frames per second, it has now been upgraded to an angelic 60 frames per second, and now with a modern 16:9 ratio—that’s 78 percent more <em>Twin Shot</em>. We even have a brand new intro animatic and ending illustrations remastered to pixel art perfection."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from the upcoming Switch 2 release Mouse Work, which utilises Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Nitrome is the same team that has previously worked on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bomb_chicken">Bomb Chicken</a>.</p>
