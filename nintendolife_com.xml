<p>In case you missed it, the estimated digital file sizes for the Switch and Switch 2 Edition of Samus' long-awaited adventure have also gone live on the eShop and official Nintendo website. So, if you didn't already know, here's what you can expect:</p>
<h3>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Estimated File Size<br></h3>
<ul>
<li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch) - <strong>28.9 GB</strong></li>
<li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - <strong>31.6 GB</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Of course, these sizes are still classed as an "estimate" at the moment and are subject to change before and after release, depending on the patches and updates distributed. Nintendo has also revealed the estimated file size of Metroid Prime 4's Upgrade Pack is <strong>1.5 GB</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> (based on the first Prime entry) is just under 7 GB according to the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-be-a-cross-gen-title-for-switch-2">previously confirmed</a>, the Switch 2 version of Metroid Prime 4 supports higher resolution, faster frame rates, HDR and mouse controls. When in docked mode, players can choose from 4K at 60fps (quality) or 1080p at 120fps (performance). And in handheld/tabletop mode, the options are 1080p at 60fps (quality) and 720p at 120fps (performance).</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The end of 2025 is fast approaching, so I've found myself going back to some of this year's releases to see which games might make their way into my top five. It was perhaps a mistake to boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, however, as those who have played it will know what an absolute monster it is. Maybe I'll put a few hours into it before moving on to something else, we'll see...</p>
<p>I've also recently gone back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/evil_within">The Evil Within</a> on the PS5. I can't believe it's over ten years old already! I do really love it though, even if it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.<br>
Happy gaming, folks!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The <em>tap, tap, tap</em> of 2026 on my door has kicked me into gear to finally finish <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. I am about 15-20 hours in, and boy, do I feel pain. It's a lot — like, <em>a lot</em> — but I haven't been this all-consumed by a game in a long old time.</p>
<p>I'm breaking up my Lumière sad times with the odd run of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, which has also proven to be right up my street. Karl has been my go-to for longer runs so far, but I am becoming increasingly attached to my beloved frog wizard, Brome, and his adorable little animations. Let's hope I can get at least one run wrapped up before a certain space bounty hunter zooms into view next month.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>With GOTY approaching, I'm in catch-up mode. This weekend, I'll be carrying on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and hopefully returning to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>. Non-2025, I've also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> recently. How I wish Nintendo would put analogue triggers back in their controllers!</p>
<p>Not 'playing', but game-related, I'm eager to catch up with the movie-length <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" rel="noopener noreferrer">NES 40th anniversary Portland Retro Gaming Expo panel</a> which went up earlier in November. And news of Rebecca Heineman's passing had me looking back over 40+ years of her work, so the 3DO port of Doom and <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgertime videos</a> are calling. <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" href="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" rel="noopener noreferrer">F cancer, indeed</a>.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>A couple of Steam releases caught my eye this weekend, and I do hope to see them both on consoles down the line. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/">Sektori</a> are the spiritual sequels you never knew you needed to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/geometry_wars_galaxies">Geometry Wars</a>, respectively. Princess woes continue with both Zelda and Melinoë still at odds with Ganon and Chronos (and Typhon, I guess) in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> (now in physical cartridge glory, hurrah!) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I do hope I get to tackle more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, it is one of the biggest surprises of the year IMO. In the middle of all this, I feel a lot of folks are overlooking a stellar Switch release that was nearly my game of the week if not for a certain pink ball: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neon_inferno">Neon Inferno</a>. I have been eagerly waiting for this one for some time now, and it is delivering on every front.</p><p>

Game of the week is, without surprise, Kirby Air Riders. I know the original GameCube title (which is on my shelf) didn’t really raise many eyebrows back in 2003, but I am hopeful a lot more people get to slide around with it this time. It is another finely crafted SORA masterpiece that will certainly keep yours truly occupied until December arrives.</p></div>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I found a very neat game on Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Astro Prospector</a>. It's about £5. Maybe less. And it's brilliant — this little snack-sized incremental game that's all about shooting asteroids and dodging bullets. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> meets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with coffee theming.</p>
<p>Other than that, still plugging away at Hades II! I stopped for a while to let the ending get patched and to help judge an indie game competition (which is where I discovered Astro Prospector), but now both of those are done, I'm back on the grind. I'm not rushing towards the ending just yet, as I'm having more fun trying out silly builds and unlocking new weapons, and after that, I might move on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, since I'm hearing good buzz about it (and the new <strong>Monster Factory</strong> episodes have me wanting to play <strong>Fallout</strong>-type games again).</p>

<p>With this in mind, the latest one is now live and it offers up a Whimsicott based on the same one used by Federico Camporesi to win the 2025 Pokémon North America International Championships (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1991841929357893758">Serebii.net</a>).

<p>To obtain this latest distribution Pokémon, the code you'll need is <strong>LA1C26TA1LW1ND</strong>. You can redeem it in the mystery gift section of the game, and it's available until <strong>30th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>The same titles are currently giving trainers the opportunity to catch a Goodra with the Mightiest Mark. This event is now underway and will repeat on 28th November - 30th November 2025.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> also received a free Switch 2 upgrade - adding frame rate improvements and higher resolution.

<p>This week, Nintendo launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> exclusively on the Switch 2. Alongside this, it also released a new line of amiibo.</p>
<p>These amiibo are bigger than many other amiibo and allow you to swap each of the characters between vehicles. They're also more expensive. As for their abilities, you'll be able to summon "figure players" and train them up. You can also unlock some rewards when you scan them.</p>
<p>The release of these new amiibo this week has got us wondering if you've decided to add any of them to your collection and how you're finding them so far.

<p>Earlier this year, Capcom surprised fans with the announcement of a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The same title eventually arrived in March of this year, and now in another update, Capcom has this week released a demo, which you can download right now from the eShop. According to the official description, it will allow players to experience the "gripping prologue" as you dive into the samurai action.</p>
<p>In our review of Onimusha 2 on the Switch, we mentioned how it was a faithful revival of one of the PS2's best games and included plenty of quality-of-life updates and extras that fans (and newcomers) were sure to appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a strong, worthy successor to the original that is now at its absolute best on Switch. Some of it feels dated by modern standards, with fixed camera angles that arguably should have been ditched back in 2002, but it still feels incredibly fun regardless."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_warlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a> was also previously released on the Switch in 2019, if you want to start from the beginning.</p>
