This even includes an update for its "limited-time" release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a>, and following an update for the Switch 2 today, another patch is now available.</p>
<p>Much like the Version 1.1.2 update, <strong>Version 1.1.3</strong> also addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience on the hybrid system. Although there's not much revealed in the official patch notes, returning players on the new platform will hopefully have a better time with the game.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (via Nintendo's support page):</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D All-Stars: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released July 14, 2025)</h2>
<h6>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h6>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>This isn't the only Mario Switch release to receive some love on the Switch 2, with Nintendo also recently rolling out updates for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and even titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, this update to Super Mario 3D All-Stars for the Switch 2 has rolled out alongside a new system firmware update. You can find out more about this in our previous post:</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45a8eb1719156/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out another firmware update for the Switch 2 and it also happens to be the first one for the month of July.</p>
<p>According to the official patch notes on the customer support page, it resolves some fixes tied to the Parental Controls and also includes general system stability improvements, which are sure to make your system super stable. Here's the official rundown:</p>
<h3>Switch 2 - Ver. 20.2.0 (Released July 14, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed an issue where Parental Control settings were not transferred from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 in certain circumstances during a system transfer.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>It's worth mentioning how this same firmware update is now also available on the Nintendo Switch, bumping this system up to Version 20.2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ltxqqi5d4s2h">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has investigated this patch, noting how this update "fixes some problems with Switch 1 backwards compatibility" including being able to "personally confirm" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal 2</a> "no longer crashes" after updating to the latest firmware.</p>
<p>The same source encourages Switch 2 owners to try out any games they were having issues with, to see if the experience has changed after this latest update. You can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">find out more about Switch 2 backwards compatibility</a> in our full guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>This latest update follows a few firmware patches in the Switch 2's launch month, which also included some "stability improvements".</p>

<p>"Announcements are coming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22299e6f9294c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you've likely seen by now, there's a new rumour from the latest Nate the Hate podcast about a Nintendo Direct potentially taking place some time <em>after</em> the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In the same episode, the YouTuber and podcaster has touched on the subject of future third-party support for the Switch 2, and how although it might not look like there's much on the way beyond the initial announcements, there are apparently multiple developers holding back reveals (<em>possibly for Nintendo's broadcast</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo is also supposedly looking to reassure everyone that its new hybrid system is a "viable platform" for "big" third-party titles going forward. As for the announcements, they're expected to be coming from many of the major publishers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Announcements are coming... I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco and many others are just waiting. They have games they want to announce for the platform. They have a lot of support for this platform.</p>
<p>"...It's going to be a very important Direct for Nintendo, to say 'this is the third-party support we have, look at the games, they can stand up to those other systems' be it from a visual or performance standpoint, and 'we are a viable platform for you to select moving forward' to experience third-party releases."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also adds how Microsoft is still expected to be a "big supporter of the system", with Activision's title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> arriving on Switch 2 last week.</p>
<p>Of course, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> are arriving later this year as well. FromSoftware's Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> is also scheduled for next year, and last week, 2K locked in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> for the new platform following its confirmation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>
