<p>2025 brought us Switch 2, of course, but it's been a very strong year across the board, with exceptional games of all sizes on all platforms - and an absolute <em>ton</em> of them. Perhaps the knock-on effects of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">layoffs</a> taking out huge swathes of the industry haven't quite hit the pipeline, but this year we've once again had more brilliant games than time to play them all.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The future may be uncertain, but the breadth of quality on Switch 1 and 2 this year is undeniable, so let's take a moment to celebrate that. We've got 25 games below, <strong>in alphabetical order</strong>, with comments from the pickees (yep, making it a word), plus a chunky list of honourable mentions to finish.</p>
<p>Let us know your personal favourites in the usual place, and <strong>keep an eye out for our reader-ranked top 50 very soon</strong>.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Quite a few roguelikes have sucked me into their ‘one more run’ trappings this year, but none have held me in a chokehold like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. After bouncing off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, it was Absolum’s simplicity that first pulled me in — its beat-‘em-up controls and Saturday-morning-cartoon visuals making the whole thing feel very un-busy in a way that completely worked for me.</p>
<p>That simplicity hides a wonderful depth beneath, and I was soon crafting builds specifically designed with an end goal in mind. The thing that kept me coming back for more, however, was how the game sells that fantasy of “next time, I’ll do better”. Every run feels like a step in the right direction, every upgrade feels like a game-changer, and, to top it all off, there’s a frog…who’s a wizard. Come on, what’s not to like? - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+ (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>'90s TV sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo</a> would fall apart if just one aspect wasn't <em>perfectly</em> realised. From the technical side, something as notionally simple as CRT static or signal distortion can be difficult to get right, but it's just one tick on a long checklist that the devs absolutely nail.</p>
<p>The interstitial graphics and links are <em>spot-on</em>. The editing, phenomenal. The writing, wonderfully subtle. The set design, transportative. The camera work, impeccable. Performances, inspired. Audio, fantastic. [<em>Feature here</em>], [<em>Strong adjective here</em>]. And it all comes together in this perfect time capsule of late 20th-century TV broadcasting.</p>
<p>Don't, whatever you do, go into it expecting a game, but this is one of the most ambitious projects to come out this year on Switch or anywhere else. - <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>A late-releasing entry, Wombat Brawler's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is a game about taking it slow, casting a line, and fishing some fish. The pixel art is quite possibly the best in any game I've played, and the loop, although simple, manages to keep you engaged with its many baits, rods, and fish to be caught.</p>
<p>If you need something after a long and stressful day, this is the right game for you. - <em>FS</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I headed into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> with very little idea of what to expect. I like TTRPGs and all things sci-fi, but I hadn’t played the first game, and everything looked a bit…texty. After making my first few decisions, picking up crewmates, risking their lives, and having rather stern words with those back on a nearby space station, I knew that this would end up sitting high on my GOTY list.</p>
<p>The music is phenomenal, the storytelling is sublime, and the characters — the characters! — well, I haven’t felt this protective over a bunch of NPCs in years. I achieved the exact ending I hoped for for my Sleeper, the one I worked so hard to put into place, and I was still an emotional wreck as the credits rolled. A stunning game, through and through. - <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><del>Cyberpunk is the best game what the hell is wrong with the rest of you?</del></p>
<p>There’s nothing quite like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2. It’s gritty, it’s dirty, it’s shiny, it’s clean, it’s a living, breathing world that casts a very unflattering reflection of our own. It’s got a belting cast of characters, intense action sequences, and some real heartache. Just be warned, if you’re hoping for a happy ending: wrong city, wrong people. - <em>AO</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>After previewing, reviewing, and building a guide campaign for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I have put over 100 hours into this 25-hour platforming adventure. And do you know what? I’d do it all over again. I struggle to think of another 2025 game that <em>feels</em> this good, or that has put this big a smile on my face. DK, you Rool. - <em>JN</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If anyone asks you why they should consider getting a Switch 2 right now, this exclusive is probably <em>the</em> main reason. It’s the exact kind of platforming experience you want to see showcasing new Nintendo hardware. I’m even happy to overlook the slight performance issues during certain boss encounters, as DK's latest outing is a smashing good time from start to finish. - <em>LD</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It’s hard to play Bananza without a massive grin on your face. It’s colourful, dynamic, open, and comes coupled with some absolutely banging tracks to enjoy as you blast through the endless swathes of destructible environments. - <em>AO</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Weirdly, every time I go back to DKB (the final boss was tricky, so I returned to previous layers to find more ooo-bananas), I've liked it a <em>little</em> less. But it made such an impact in July that it still makes my top five with its boundless beans and boldness. It channels the quality you'd expect from the Odyssey team into something pleasingly, almost wrecklessly different. - <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">ENDER MAGNOLIA: Bloom in the Mist (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Despite releasing way back in January, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia</a> has been ever-present in my mind – even in a year stuffed full of fantastic Metroidvanias. Taking everything good about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> and fine-tuning it, including better combat, fantastic traversal skills, excellent bosses, and a refined skill system, makes for a near-perfect experience in my mind.</p>
<p>Tonally, as well, Ender Magnolia has its own identity, a level of melancholia blended with dark steampunk. The characters help bring a little levity to the adventure. But this is a world I could gladly wallow (or delight) in for a long time. Whatever Adglobe and Live Wire do next, I’ll be there. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I never played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fantasy_life">Fantasy Life</a> on the 3DS, but the buzz surrounding Level-5’s long-awaited sequel could not escape me. And my goodness, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> had a <em>grip</em> on me. Outside of an MMORPG, I don’t think I’ve ever played a game so stuffed full of content that also feels completely coherent. A game that should be completely overwhelming, yet is so relaxed and easy to digest.</p>
<p>Level-5’s return over these past two years has been a joy to watch, and I’m so glad we’re seeing more from the team. I still occasionally dip into Ginomorsia for a few minutes just to run around, level up some lives, and live a carefree life doing stuff. It’s just a great escape, one that I‘m excited to lose more time to when the DLC comes. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Come on, this is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, the greatest SRPG ever made. I still feel this way after playing The Ivalice Chronicles, which elevates an all-timer thanks to some incredible voice acting. Joe Pitts and Gregg Lowe deserve all of the accolades for bringing humanity and depth to Ramza and Delita. The gameplay tweaks also help smooth out some of the rougher edges. Basically, this is a must-play, in my eyes. - <em>AH</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My favourite Final Fantasy? Indeed it is, and in this Ivalice Chronicles edition, it sings like never before. I have no issue with the missing War of the Lions content in all honesty, having personally preferred the remixed narrative here, and they also tweaked and polished, and added vital stuff like new difficulty levels, whilst nailing the graphical enhancements. A stunner! - <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>I didn’t think Supergiant Games could bring anything new to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> formula, but now I’ve played over 100 hours of this, I can tell you, I was <em>very</em> wrong. The gameplay variety here is astounding: each of the six weapons feels unique, with every aspect requiring a completely different build. I’m also a big fan of some of the new boons, especially Apollo and Hera who I’m always begging to get on every run.</p>
<p>I have some qualms with the story, and the various currencies may be a bit much, but it hasn’t dulled my love for Supergiant's output. I’ll buy everything they release, because they know how to make an exceptional game. Hades II is no exception. - <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>My hype levels were high for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> (like, real high), and, miraculously, Team Cherry managed to live up to them. I am, historically, very bad with Soulslike mechanics, but finally beating that High Halls gauntlet after throwing multiple hours at it, oof, there’s no feeling quite like it! - <em>JN</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I have a lot to say about Silksong, so I’ll say it elsewhere - look out for a feature! But my worries about this sequel not living up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> were unfounded; I’m <em>desperate</em> to play it again. And again. It makes me sad I’ll never get to experience my first steps into the Citadel or finally defeating the true final boss again. - <em>AH</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As far as Metroidvanias go, this is so up at the top of the list it’s hard to see it from all the way down here. It’s <em>brutally</em> difficult, and absolutely not one for those who can’t handle unfiltered rage, but there are few games more satisfying. - <em>AO</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>As a diehard Musou fan, I am always ready to jump in and defend the genre against its many naysayers. With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, I genuinely, for the first time, don't even feel the need to bother. You can say what you want, mate. This is deep, addictive, and wonderfully fun action fare that looks and performs a doozy on Switch 2.</p>
<p>They've been close with a few entries in the past, but this is the first Warriors game where Switch performance, alongside combat enhancements and, lest we forget, that official nod from Nintendo on the lore front, all marry to make for something I'd unreservedly recommend to any action game fan. - <em>PJ</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I really wanted to get into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> when it was released on Switch 1, but I wasn’t sold on the game's performance. Fortunately, Age of Imprisonment does a much better job in this department (bumping the action up to 60fps, for the most part), and in terms of the gameplay, it’s one of Koei Tecmo’s best Musous to date. - <em>LD</em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>I’ve always been a fan of Llamasoft, so it really shouldn’t come as a surprise that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot</a> resonated so much. While technically a remake of the 1984 original from Dave Theurer, Jeff Minter’s latest creation is a different beast altogether.</p>
<p>Blending deceptively simple gameplay with mind-melting psychedelic visuals, it's a joy to behold, and a game that simply begs to be replayed as you strive for the global leaderboards. I hesitate to use the phrase “there’s nothing else quite like it,” but screw it: There’s nothing else quite like it. <em>- OR</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="45df45825f946"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45df45825f946/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK Charts data is in, and there's honestly very little change in the top ten this week, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> once again claiming the top spot.</p>
<p>In fact, the top eight games have all played a bit of a switcheroo, while the latter two spots in the top ten are taken up by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026 Edition</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> continues its descent down the charts to land at number 17, though with sales skewed heavily in favour of the Switch 2, this perhaps suggests that the hardcore crowd are still picking it up in droves.</p>
<p><strong>Mario Kart</strong> continues to demonstrate its widespread appeal, with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a> once again taking up their positions in the top ten. It'll be interesting to see how long this keeps up as the Switch 2 expands its library further in 2026.</p>

<p>It's no Fiorentina jersey, but it's something</p>

<p>Nintendo has a long history of sponsoring professional sports teams, and one club it's continued to support over the years is the Japanese football side, Kyoto Sanga, which currently competes in Japan's top-flight competition known as the J-League.</p>
<p>Nintendo owns 16.6% of this club, <a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/the-story-of-kyoto-sanga-nintendos-favourite-football-team/">and ever since it signed on in 1993</a>, the video game giant's traditional 19th-century kanji logo has appeared on the back of the kit, above the player number. Now, in a slight and subtle update to the shirt for the new season, the logo is surrounded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>.</p>
<p>So, while the traditional logo might not be quite as recognisable here in the west, you can now at least impress fellow Nintendo fans (<em>and maybe some sports ones</em>) with these colourful Pikmin.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15b9952a8d147"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15b9952a8d147/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via @Genki_JPN on X / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Again, while it might not be <em>quite</em> as easy to spot as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2019/09/feature_remember_when_video_game_football_shirts_were_a_big_deal">Nintendo's ACF Fiorentina kit featuring the company's red (and iconic) "racetrack" logo</a>, any fan of Nintendo should definitely notice. As for the rest of the kit, as you can see in the images above, it features the usual purples, white and red colours – matching the club's emblem.</p>
<p>As Nintendo fans should know, Shigeru Miyamoto has a soft spot for Pikmin, and has previously mentioned how he considers them to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/miyamoto-considers-pikmin-to-be-nintendos-most-global-characters">Nintendo's most "global characters"</a>, so it's no surprise they continue to pop up pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>On a <em>slightly</em> related note, Nintendo this week rolled out a new game update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> on the Switch to fix multiple bugs.</p>

<p>"I can't really play it now though"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hideo Kojima has rightly cemented himself as a legend in the games industry, having created iconic titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">P.T.</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">Death Stranding</a>. Although it probably shouldn't come as a surprise, however, Kojima cites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> as the reason he started making games in the first place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA">new interview</a> with WIRED in which Kojima answers questions submitted online, he's asked which game he has played the most. His immediate answer was Super Mario Bros., claiming to have played it for "a year" when he was a college student. He states that "without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry".</p>
<p>Although he alludes to its simplicity (it was, after all, a launch title for the NES), he says that it pushed him to believe in the potential of games, claiming that "this medium would one day surpass movies".</p>
<p>Here's the full quote from Kojima:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Bros., definitely. Played it for a year. I was a college student. I skipped school to play at home. Without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry... Yeah... I can't really play it now, though.</p>
<p>"It's a side-scrolling action game. Mario just goes left to right. Basically just jumping. But there's a dash button. Using that and jump subtly changes the jump trajectory to attack or dodge. It has almost no story, but it felt like you were on an adventure. When I saw that, although it was pixel art with no story, I felt this medium would one day surpass movies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kojima has recently released <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and is currently working on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/physint">Physint</a> (working title). The original Death Stranding, initially a console exclusive for the PS5, has since been released on everything from the Xbox to the Amazon Luna, leading many to speculate that it might eventually wind up on the Switch 2.</p>
