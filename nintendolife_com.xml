<p>Launching this October</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're into games that go hard on frenetic fun and stylish visuals, then you might want to keep an eye on Full Metal Schoolgirl, a new title headed for the Switch 2 from Yuke's, the developers behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earth_defense_force_world_brothers_2">EARTH DEFENSE FORCE: World Brothers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>, Full Metal Schoolgirl takes place within a dystopian Japan, where you must face off against Meternal Jobz, a corrupt corporate superpower. Climbing the heights of an ever-shifting 100-story skyscraper, you'll be mowing down hordes of undead salarymen with massive guns as you work to enact your sweet revenge.</p>
<p>It looks pretty cool; we love the colourful visuals, the awesome enemy designs, and of course, the gigantic weapons. We only hope the gameplay brings enough variety to keep us occupied for the entire runtime, but so far, early impressions are pretty positive.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Take Revenge as a Fully-Mechanized Schoolgirl:</strong> Step into the role of a cyborg heroine armed with an arsenal of high-powered weaponry and cutting-edge mechanical upgrades in this exhilarating action shooter. Infiltrate Meternal Jobz, the world’s most ruthless mega-corporation, and fight back against undead “Working Dead”, the relentless corporate grunts that will stop at nothing to protect their employer. Show no mercy – scrap them all!</p>
<p><strong>- Engage in Close-Quarters Combat in an Ever-Changing Skyscraper:</strong> Enter a towering 100-story skyscraper where the evil CEO awaits on the top floor. Climb higher while navigating an evolving structure as each new run introduces changing layouts and obstacles from its trap-like security system. Own the battlefield to reach the top!</p>
<p><strong>- Fund Upgrades with Live-Streamed Battles:</strong> Use the power of content creation to win the favor of viewers! Obtain materials and rewards by defeating enemies to improve your character and earn donations for upgrades by live-streaming to a captivated audience. As the number of viewers increases, so does the support. Even in the face of defeat, remember you are not alone… the viewers of your livestream are cheering you on!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll have more information on Full Metal Schoolgirl as we get closer to its October release date.</p>

<p>But it's far from its best</p>

<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1400d0d0b7f88/xenoblade-chronicles-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> developer Monolith Soft has recently reported an impressive 19% profit increase for the financial year ending March 2025.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/408174">Game Biz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/xenoblade-dev-monolith-soft-sees-19-profit-increase/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the company recorded profits of 487 million yen during the last financial year, which is up from 409 million yen the year prior. During this period, of course, Monolith developed and released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch, meaning that every core Xenoblade title is now available on one system.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82xlpzhs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10LJgMQyAc" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Monolith is also known for its extensive contributions to other Nintendo properties, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the increase, this isn't the best performance from Monolith Soft – far from it. According to the graph below, the company's highest performance came in 2021, during which it achieved nearly 1,200 million yen in profit.</p>

<p>Speaking of healthy numbers, reports have also been circulating to suggest that <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/01/nintendo-has-now-sold-over-5-million-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-worldwide/">Nintendo has now sold 5 million Switch 2 consoles</a> since its launch. These come via updated figures on Nintendo's official investor site, but this has since been removed. It isn't completely clear whether what the figure represents, but it's likely to be projected sales that Nintendo had mistakenly posted on its site.</p>
