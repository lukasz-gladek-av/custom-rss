<p>Coming 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Revolution Software has unveiled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_the_smoking_mirror_reforged">Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</a>, an enhanced rerelease of the second game in the Broken Sword series. And it's coming to Switch, alongside other platforms, in early 2026.</p>
<p>Originally teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/broken-sword-reforged-team-teases-another-remaster-might-be-on-the-cards">much earlier this year</a>, The Smoking Mirror appropriately follows on from the excellent 2024 enhanced release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a> and brings with it the same bells and whistles. Though it <em>is</em> getting a 4K release this time — perhaps a free patch for Switch 2 owners, then? We hope so...</p>
<p>The Smoking Mirror is perhaps equally as beloved as the first game, so we're sure fans are extremely excited to dive into this rerelease. Plus, for those who want an extra dose of nostalgia, you can swap between the 1997 visuals and the new 'reforged' ones here, too.</p>
<p>Taking place six months after Shadow of the Templars, George Stobbart reunites with his friend Nico Collard in Paris; she's been researching Mayan history after receiving a Mayan stone tablet. But this path takes the pair on the road to unravelling a deadly conspiracy, all across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America.</p>


<p>Not only will you be able to swap between the old and new visuals, but you'll once again have the chance to play 'traditional mode', where puzzles are harder, or a 'story mode' if you need a few hints along the way.</p>
<p>Right now, we've got to wait until next year to get our hands on The Smoking Mirror, but if you haven't checked out Shadow of the Templars, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">we highly recommend it</a>.</p>

<p>Sonic boom</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8c96ac7ff2dc7"><a title="Sonic x Olympics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c96ac7ff2dc7/sonic-x-olympics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / International Olympic Committee</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA and the International Olympic Committee have today announced that they are teaming up on a new "co-branded merchandising programme" featuring none other than Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>The multi-year deal will see the blue blur cropping up alongside the Olympic rings in a whole range of merch planned for release next year. According to the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-and-sega-announce-multi-year-licensing-agreement-featuring-sonic-the-hedgehog">official announcement</a>, SEGA and the IOC will now "explore opportunities to license the new designs for select merchandise collaborations", and we got the following first look at the 'Five Rings' collaboration to boot.</p>

<p>To be clear, the only specific that we've got so far is that the collaboration will feature <em>merchandise</em>. Importantly, that's not games. But come on, you know where everyone's mind went...</p>
<p>The collab announcements on the <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1975184289622065600">official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonic-official.bsky.social/post/3m2jo6phzuk2k">BlueSky</a> accounts have been awash with replies hopeful of an '<strong>at the Olympic Games</strong>' comeback. Of course, Nintendo — and therefore, Mario — doesn't appear to be on board yet, but let's not pretend that Sonic hasn't had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/sonic_ditches_mario_in_his_very_own_olympic_games_tokyo_2020_release">solo Olympic adventures</a> in the past too.</p>




<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/rumour-mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-finished">last we heard</a>, the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games series was dead in the water after the IOC apparently chose to end its partnership with Nintendo and SEGA to focus on NFTs and esports. That was according to series veteran Lee Cocker, who, after working on each entry in the franchise, claimed that it was "finished" after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_sonic_at_the_olympic_games_tokyo_2020">Tokyo 2020</a> instalment.</p>
<p>Whether the series actually returns or not remains to be seen, but at least the IOC and SEGA are back on speaking terms. We'll be keeping an eye out over the coming year for more information.</p>

<p>Beloved bundle?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="3e5b0cf8b06c1"><a title="Mario Galaxy / Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e5b0cf8b06c1/mario-galaxy-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is out now for the Nintendo Switch, boasting some rather lovely little upgrades for those playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The release, which comes either as a bundle or separately via the eShop, has garnered a fair bit of attention for its price over the last few weeks, but the simple fact remains that these are, in our opinion, two of the finest platformer games ever created, and they've never looked better.</p>
<p>In fact, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2">recent review</a> ended with a coveted score of <strong>9/10</strong> in which we praised the boundless creativity on display along with the thoughtful visuals upgrades, but noted that the gyro controls don't quite stack up next to the original Wii controls. It's also currently sitting at a healthy 88 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2/">Metacritic</a> too, so that's nice.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188104 @ 1759778272 -->
<p>If you don't agree with us though, that's absolutely fine! That's exactly what this poll is for. So feel free to apply your own score to Galaxy and Galaxy 2 below. And if you haven't played it yet, or you feel like changing your mind at a later date, then fear not, you can always come back later – we'll be here waiting.</p>

<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fe3dadf3e45d7"><a title="Horipad Turbo 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe3dadf3e45d7/horipad-turbo-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Hori has introduced another budget-friendly alternative to the official Switch 2 Pro Controller, with a new pad coming in at roughly $54 when converted from Japanese yen (thanks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller">The Verge</a>).</p>
<p>This means it's priced significantly lower than the $89.99 Nintendo itself is asking for with its official offering, but a few sacrifices have been made to bring costs down. So crucially, the Horipad Turbo controller cannot wake the Switch 2 remotely, there's no headphone jack, and it doesn't sport any NFC functionality for your amiibos.</p>
<p>What it <em>does</em> do, however, is let you lock the buttons in the middle – like the home, capture, +, and - buttons – via a small toggle located on the back. Why? Well, who knows, but there you go.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, there are plenty of arcade controllers these days that include tournament lock toggles to disable any inessential inputs while in the heat of battle. It's possible Hori might want to capture some of that niche, but these new pads don't particularly strike us as the go-to option for fight fans.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the joysticks utilise TMR technology to minimise any potential stick drift, while there are two additional inputs on the back of the pad to rival those found on the Pro Controller. Finally, Hori has seen fit to allow remapping across pretty much the entire suite of buttons, so that should come in handy if you like to tinker around with that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>There's no word on when (or even if) these new pads will make their way to the West, but we'll be keep a close eye on them regardless. Even if they don't sport all the features you're looking for in a Switch 2 controller, it's always nice to have options.</p>
