<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> has been updated to version 10.0.0, bringing with it a whole bunch of new content, but also improving the game's visuals and performance for those playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>But how has it been improved, exactly? Well, the above video should clear things up quite nicely for you. We're mainly looking at bumps in resolution and frame rate, and this is perhaps most obvious within the Splatsville hub area, which notably at a stable, albeit sluggish 30fps on the Switch.</p>
<p>This has been increased significantly on the Switch 2, and the smooth gameplay looks like a real treat on Nintendo's new console.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We also see gameplay from the standard Turf War battle along with the Salmon Run mode, so there's plenty to dive into here to see exactly how the game has been improved from Switch 1.</p>
<p>In other news, it's also been confirmed that a Splatoon spin-off game, titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, will be making its way to the Switch 2. Very little is known about the project so far, but it looks to be a single-player story-focused experience in which you take on the role of a mechanic investigating a mysterious island alongside Deep Cut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/hershey-teams-up-with-pokemon-for-new-collectable-chocolates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Hershey Pokémon 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/89426dbe74728/hershey-pokemon-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Hershey Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hershey, the American confectionary company, has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to launch <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/hersheys-and-pokemon-team-up-for-collectible-chocolate-bars-and-kisses">a new range of Hershey's Kisses</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the original 151 Pokémon from the days of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red and Blue</a>, the Kisses will be wrapped in special collectable foil that kind of, sort of look like Pokéballs. Underneath, you'll find an image of one Pokémon from the original line-up per chocolate.</p>
<p>Ashley Reeb, Senior Associate Brand Manager at The Hershey Company, said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our collaboration with Pokémon combines the timeless appeal of <em>Hershey's Kisses</em> chocolates with the joy of discovery and collecting — making it more than just a treat. The special-edition foils may spark a little friendly competition but also unite fans around their love for milk chocolate and Pokémon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So what's the deal here, exactly? Is Hershey essentially encouraging folks to keep the chocolates as they are, fully wrapped and never to be eaten? Or can you carefully unwrap them and keep the foil intact? Hmm... Quite bizarre, if you ask us.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like some might like to keep the chocolates completely unopened, as Hershey is also launching a special, limited edition case in which to house your collection. These are to be sold on a first come, first served basis, and it sounds like you'll need both a 'Hersheyland' account and Pokémon account to nab one (because we need accounts for everything these days, right?).</p>

<p>If the Kisses don't appeal, Hershey is also launching Pokémon-themed chocolate bars, with 12 designs available for the full-size bar, and 18 available for the snak-size bar.</p>
<p>Over on the new Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> received a free update to bring the games' performance up to a more acceptable standard. One could argue that it still looks a bit rubbish, but they at least run much better now.</p>
