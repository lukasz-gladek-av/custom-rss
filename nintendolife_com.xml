            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a fresh new look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and while much of the footage is recycled from previous trailers, there were definitely a few interesting new shots to consider.</p>
<p>One of these is pretty throwaway at first glance, but a few fans online believe it might be hiding a pretty significant hint. It occurs at <strong>0:23</strong> and depicts a weird little insect creature crawling/slithering along the ground and leaving a trail of gunk in its wake.</p>
<p>So what is this thing, then? Well, chances are it's probably just one of the game's normal enemies, but some folks think it could be something more. If you cast your mind back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_hunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a>, you might remember that Kanden, one of the bounty hunters Samus encounters on her journey, is able to transform into the slug-like Stinglarva form, much like Samus' own Morph Ball ability.</p>

<p>Could this strange insect in the Prime 4 trailer actually be Kanden in Stinglarva form? Well, we're not entirely convinced at this stage. For starters, while we can't get a really good look at the creature, it nevertheless differs in look to Kanden. It's not quite so mechanical in nature, and we're certain it's also sporting a pair of hefty mandibles and some tiny little legs.</p>
<p>Then again, designs can be changed, so we're not going to rule it out <em>completely</em>. We'll keep an open mind, but we reckon Samus has enough on her plate with that cheeky monkey Sylux roaming about. Goodness knows she doesn't need to deal with Kanden too!</p>

<figure data-uuid="13ef8c2ae915b"><a title="Luigi's Mansion 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/13ef8c2ae915b/luigis-mansion-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has provided the clearest indication yet that it intends to acquire more development teams to "strengthen its internal development organisation".</p>
<p>The comment can be seen on page 54 of its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">financial report</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-plans-to-strengthen-their-game-development-capabilities-by-expanding-facilities-and-acquiring-other-developers-as-subsidiaries.1344088/">ResetEra</a>), in which Nintendo lays out the steps involved in utilising funds to build the business foundation. It outright states that its plan includes "initiatives such as acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries and augmenting our development facilities, and the construction of Corporate Headquarters Development Center, Building No. 2".</p>
<p>This might, on the surface at least, go against <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-would-rather-organically-expand-the-organisation-than-rely-solely-on-acquisitions">Nintendo's statement last year</a> in which it said it would rather "organically expand the organisation" over the acquisition of developers. Though while this latest reveal from the company appears to indicate a more aggressive stance, we can't imagine Nintendo suddenly going on a development shopping spree anytime soon.</p>
<p>It's an interesting shift from the company though, right? Could we perhaps see a team like MercurySteam join the fold after its exceptional work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>? It's nothing but speculation on our part for now, but we think it's clear that more acquisitions will happen in the future – possibly within the next financial year.</p>
<figure data-uuid="aa08a93ca5567"><a title="Nintendo - Financial Report" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aa08a93ca5567/nintendo-financial-report.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how things develop in the coming months and years, at least. Switch 2 is going to be an exceptionally important console for Nintendo, and the company will want to ensure that it has all hands on deck to keep the games flowing.</p>
