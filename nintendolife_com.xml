<figure><a title="Grand Theft Auto Trilogy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fc712168c2f7/grand-theft-auto-trilogy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Rockstar Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">arrival of Game-Key Cards</a> on the Switch 2, there has been ongoing discussion about the future of third-party physical releases. Even during the Switch generation, certain hard copy releases didn't always live up to expectations, opting to include a download code instead of the actual game.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some companies are still making an effort, and with this in mind, there's news today that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy</a> is now available as a proper physical release on the original Switch platform after all this time.</p>
<p>This information is based on a listing on Amazon, with the box art no longer including a small banner mentioning download requirements. According to the same page, the release of this version was last month, and the page for the Switch release requiring a download is still live (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-release/">thanks for the heads up, Nintendo Everything</a>). You can see the 'before' and 'after' shots in the social post below:</p>

<p>Although this is just a single listing, it's already got quite a lot of attention from Switch owners who have wanted a proper physical version of this collection that didn't require a download. If this listing is accurate, hopefully, it comes with the more recent updates <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/rockstar-games-announces-acquisition-of-dev-behind-gta-trilogy-upgrades">by the developer 'Video Games Deluxe'</a>, who took over from the 'Grove Street Games' port team.</p>

<p>Chibi-Robo returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> to the Switch 2's GameCube library next week on <strong>21st August, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This title was one of the many games originally confirmed alongside the launch of the GameCube library for the Switch Online service. It originally made its debut on the GameCube in 2005/06 and was developed by the team at Skip.</p>
<p>Here's an official description about what you can expect from this title, if you haven't played it before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little robot who wants to bring happiness to all!</p>
<p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCubeâ„¢ system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To play this title on Switch 2 you'll need to have an active subscription to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service.</p>
<p>Some of the other GameCube titles confirmed for the Switch Online's GameCube service include Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario Sunshine and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>. This next update will follow on from the release of Super Mario Strikers on the service in July.</p>
