<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Cow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e7d7935d5da7/mario-kart-world-cow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time for another look at the weekly UK charts, and what do you know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is still holding onto pole position.</p>
<p>Yes, the Switch 2's flagship title has landed the gold medal once again, but it wasn't without competition. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> made a gnarly arrival, kickflipping into second in its debut week (with only 11% and 10% of sales coming from Switch 2 and Switch 1, mind you) and the likes of <strong>The Sims 4: Enchanted by Nature</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/legacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_1_and_2_remastered">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</a> also put up good enough numbers in the first week to disturb the waters of the chart's upper ranking.</p>
<p>Everything else is a pretty familiar sight, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> all hanging about in the top 10. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has taken a bit of a tumble this week and now finds itself in tenth, while <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has made an almighty leap from 25th to fifth.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon TCG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b3b9accbe2652/pokemon-tcg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've had stories previously in which shops specialising in trading cards have found themselves the unfortunate victims of robberies, but this one really takes the cake.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-card-shop-robbed-of-valuable-cards-by-other-pokemon-card-shop-a-few-blocks-away/">Automaton</a>, a 35-year-old Japanese man was arrested on suspicion of robbery on 9th July 2025 and is alleged to have stolen 123 items at knifepoint worth approximately $94,000 from a Pokémon Trading Card store. The twist? The accused is apparently the owner of his own Pokémon and One Piece-focused trading card shop within the same neighbourhood.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvtronx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Although the police didn't disclose such information, the owner of the target store posted a message on <a href="https://x.com/MASTERS_gifu/status/1943158484863693250">X</a> to confirm that the accused is the manager of a competing store. The post concludes by stating that anybody else involved in the crime should "surrender immediately", asking those who might have information to come forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the robbery incident that occurred at our store on 6/14,<br>
following Sakaguchi and Ando, the manager of the neighboring store Treca Junky @toreca_junky, Yuji Watanabe, has also been arrested as an accomplice in the robbery.</p>
<p>Those still involved should surrender immediately.<br>
Thinking you won’t get caught is impossible.</p>
<p>We will absolutely catch everyone.</p>
<p>We welcome any information, no matter how small.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post has since attracted quite a bit of attention, though it remains unclear whether there have been any further developments at this stage.</p>
<p>It's good that at least <em>some</em> progress is being made to get the whole thing sorted, mind. It's likely pretty difficult to deduct who might be perpetrating such crimes at the best of times, but when the stolen goods are then sold on immediately in a rival store..? Gosh, that must be rough.</p>

<p>According to a new copyright listing</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong - Mario Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a39b4952f817/donkey-kong-mario-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the monumental success of <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, it seems Nintendo and Universal are keen to expand on its new venture beyond the upcoming sequel in 2026.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-and-universal-pictures-seemingly-pursuing-donkey-kong-movie/">Nintendo Everything</a>, a <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">new copyright filing</a> has been spotted that is simply listed as <strong>'Untitled Donkey Kong Project ;Motion picture'</strong>. The date of recordation is 6th June 2025, with two dates listed as the execution: 9th May and 17th May 2025.</p>
<p>Now, are we absolutely sure that this relates to a new movie starring Donkey Kong? No. But given that it's listed as a 'motion picture' and it's from both Nintendo and Universal leads us to believe that maybe a spin-off starring DK is in very early pre-production (or if not pre-production, then early discussions, at least).</p>
<figure><a title="DK Movie - Copyright" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/671a601aee3cc/dk-movie-copyright.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">Public Records</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo currently has two movie projects officially in the works. The first is a direct sequel to the Mario Movie – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/super-mario-world-looks-to-be-the-official-name-of-the-next-mario-movie">rumoured to be titled 'Super Mario World'</a> – scheduled for release on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>. The second is a Legend of Zelda live-action movie scheduled for release on <strong>7th May 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>It's likely, then, that if a Donkey Kong movie is indeed in the works, then we probably won't be seeing it for a few years yet. Chances are, however, that Nintendo will be keen to retain the voice talent from the Mario Movie. Seth Rogan voiced DK himself and Fred Armisen voicing Cranky Kong.</p>
<p>It looks like we're seeing the start of a 'Mario Cinematic Universe', folks – or 'MCU' for short. We're certain that won't cause any confusion... Maybe 'Nintendo Cinematic Universe' is better.</p>

<p>A Switch 2 user claims they've got the game early</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b84bbc2b9c09/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> isn't officially available for Switch 2 until next week, but it seems copies may already be out in the wild.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/50710-donkey-kong-bananza-s-street-date-has-been-broken">highlighted by GoNintendo</a>, a user on the Nintendo Switch subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mark7z/">known as 'Mark7z'</a> has supposedly acquired a copy of DK's anticipated release early.</p>
<p>Attached to the user's post are photos of the box art and game card, and in follow-up comments are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lye5oy/comment/n2u21im/?context=3">some photos of the game's home menu icon</a>, as well as photos of the game in what's claimed to be a "playable" state.</p>

<p>The same individual says they didn't get it from a store, but instead through their "connection" and goes on to mention how the title is currently running on Version 1.0.0 – with an update, apparently, ready to go. They add that they <em>won't</em> be installing this update until release day.</p>
<p>Some replies to this post also raised some concerns about the type of game card included, and the user responded, stating it's not a "game-key card" but an "actual" game card.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8jptxoh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, street dates being broken on major first-party Nintendo titles (along with leaks) was quite common during the Switch generation. So, this might not go down well at Nintendo headquarters, seeing as how the official release for DK's new outing isn't until <strong>17th July 2025</strong>, and this is the first major game to follow the system's launch and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:185143 @ 1752487079 -->
<p>If we hear any significant updates or more cases of this game being accessed by other Switch 2 users ahead of its launch, we'll let you know. At the very least, consider this a warning that story-related leaks (or more) could potentially start circulating online in the coming days.</p></section>
