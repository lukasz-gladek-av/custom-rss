<p>But she'd still "love to play Bayonetta again"</p>

<figure data-uuid="fe3844413924a"><a title="Bayonetta 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe3844413924a/bayonetta-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Jennifer Hale, one of the most iconic voice actors and best known for playing Commander Shepard in the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy and Naomi Hunter and Emma Emmerich in the <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> series, has spoken about her experience in playing Bayonetta in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>.</p>
<p>Hale, who took over the role <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/its-official-bayonettas-og-voice-actor-wont-be-returning-for-the-third-outing">from Hellena Taylor</a> for the third entry in the series, told <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/jennifer-hale-bayonetta-3-controversy-femshep-223726-20251121">GAMINGbible</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jennifer-hale-would-love-to-play-bayonetta-again-but-admits-it-was-not-fun-getting-thrown-under-the-bus-after-she-replaced-original-voice-actor">IGN</a>) that she "got thrown under the bus by that whole thing."</p>
<p>"I was unable to speak on my own behalf because I was under not one but two NDAs. Eventually, I was allowed to make a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/bayonettas-new-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-issues-statement-about-bayonetta-3">statement</a>, which I appreciated, and I was able to present the facts,” Hale continues.</p>
<p>Following PlatinumGames' announcement of the new voice actor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/bayonettas-og-voice-actor-asks-fans-to-boycott-third-game-after-platinumgames-wage-fallout">Taylor urged fans to boycott the game</a> due to a pay dispute. She claimed that the studio offered her only $4,000 "to do the whole game...as a flat rate". Fans rallied around Taylor initially, before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/a-new-bayonetta-3-report-features-a-differing-account-of-platinumgames-va-pay-offer">reports emerged</a> that Taylor had been offered that rate for between four to five sessions.</p>
<p>Hale says that “There were some things said [that were] presented as facts, but were false. I would have never taken a role otherwise. Before I accepted the audition, I checked everything thoroughly, and I trust the director."</p>

<p>"Thankfully, playing Bayonetta was so much fun, and the community was so welcoming to me, especially after the fiasco had passed and the facts came out."</p>
<p>Following Hale's initial statement, PlatnumGames came out in support of the actor, stating "We give our full support to Jennifer Hale as the new Bayonetta, and align with everything in her statement."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the controversy died down following those additional reports and Platinum's own involvement, and the experience hasn't put Hale off of the idea of returning to the role: "It was not fun getting thrown under the bus like I had, but I was happy to come out on the other side.”</p>
<p>While the drama has largely subsided, earlier this year, series creator <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/thats-some-real-coward-s-hideki-kamiya-discusses-the-fallout-from-the-bayonetta-3-voiceover-controversy">Hideki Kamiya shared his thoughts on the ordeal</a>: "Man, that was seriously lame."</p>
