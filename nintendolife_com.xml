<p>The patch actually encompasses ver. 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the former of which adds in the game's online modes, and the latter sets about fixing any unwanted bugs that might pop up along the way. There are a bunch of features included in this one too, such as the addition of a Team Battle to City Trial, the ability to share replays, and amiibo support for the upcoming Air Riders figures.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch2/software_support/aaaba/111/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Support website</a>, and we've included the Google translation of them below:</p>

<p>We had a great time with Kirby Air Riders, calling it "a cracking sequel that gives solo players much more to dig into with its story campaign, whilst also bringing all-new levels of shiny graphics, bells and whistles to its returning City Trial, Air Ride, and Top Down Racing modes" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">our review</a>.</p>
