<p>Still just a download code, mind</p>

It's a cause for celebration, of course, but there's a part of us that can't help but feel a pang of envy after realising that Japan is getting treated to a '<a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/switch-frlg/lineup/">Special Edition</a>' physical release, too.</p>
<p>We use "physical" hesitantly there, because it seems that this boxed release is still reliant on its included download code if you actually want to, you know, play the game. That said, it's a beauty.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fqojmvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The Special Edition includes two reproductions of the original Japanese GBA cases, and a rather swanky trio of laser-engraved glass balls with Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle inside. Putting these balls on their respective stand in the included display case, lets them light up in a fitting green/red/blue hue. <em>Oof</em>.</p>


<p>This release will be available from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html">Japanese Pokémon Center online store</a> from <strong>Saturday, 28th February</strong>. Both the FireRed and LeafGreen versions (the only difference being the contents of the download code) will set you back <strong>19,800 yen</strong> — which is roughly <strong>£95 / $127</strong>, <em>gulp</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this is a Japan-only release, with TPC saying that it <em>might</em> be available at physical Pokémon Centers at a later date. So... still Japan-only. Hey, let's keep those fingers crossed for a Western launch at some point down the line, eh?</p>

<p>Of course, TPC isn't celebrating any old birthday this year. 2026 marks the series' 30th anniversary, so we're cautiously optimistic that there might be a surprise or two in store for us during the show (alongside all of the usual app updates, of course). Gen 10 feels like a no-brainer, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed and LeafGreen</a> are already confirmed, but could there be <em>more</em>? Don't worry, we've got the clown makeup on standby.</p>

<p>Coming next week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has seemingly revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> for the Switch earlier than planned, as a whole bunch of eShop listings are now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/english-pokemon-firered-version-switch/">live on the eShop</a>. <em>[Update: The reveal has now been officially announced - see the trailer below.]</em></p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each with a launch date of <strong>27th February</strong> (Pokémon Day, of course), the release has bypassed Nintendo Switch Online entirely, meaning you can own the games digitally à la carte. There will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-is-getting-a-stunning-special-edition-release-in-japan">a 'physical' edition in Japan</a>, although the game itself will still be a code-in-box. No word if that's planned for release outside Japan, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, releasing FireRed and LeafGreen is a pretty big move to acknowledge Pokémon's 30th anniversary, much like the launch of classic titles on the 3DS almost 10 years ago for the 20th celebrations.</p>
<p>Each language version of the game is available as a separate download, so beware if you're pre-ordering on the eShop and get the language you want!</p>

<figure data-uuid="052e04d374646"><a title="Pokemon Switch eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/052e04d374646/pokemon-switch-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The titles will be available shortly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">a Pokémon Presents showcase</a> on the 27th, so we'll be sure to keep an eye out for any further anniversary announcements from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</p>

<p>Beat 'em up with "Bimmy &amp; Friends"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The 2D pixel beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a> continues to add new characters, and in the "largest character update yet", it's now added four more fighters.</p>
<p>Each character in this free "<strong>Bimmy &amp; Friends DLC</strong>" brings a new face, new personality, and a new fighting style to the city - allowing players to experiment with "powerful tag-team" combos. Here's the rundown about and you can see each fighter in action in the trailer above.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4c01a997708c3"><a title="Double Dragon Gaiden" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c01a997708c3/double-dragon-gaiden.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Secret Base / Maximum Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Armored Okada</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the Oyabun of the Okada Clan, Lady Okada faces constant discrimination from the elders. When a powerful threat emerged, the elders presented her with the sacred clan armor - a challenge disguised as support. If she triumphs, she earns their respect. If she fails, she proves them right.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jackson</strong></p>
<p>A heavyweight boxer known for his lightning-fast jabs and devastating uppercuts. Once too strong for the ring, he grew bored of rules and regulations. Seeking greater thrills, he turned to the streets, where his power and skill made him a prized asset for every gang.</p>

<p><strong>Bimmy Lee</strong></p>
<p>Legends speak of a secret within the Sōsetsuken - a form that can only be mastered by two. The tale has been passed down for so long that few believe it, dismissing it as myth or joke. But could this be the proof…?</p>

<p>If you haven't already got this game on the Switch, it's currently on sale in select locations such as the US for $7.49 instead of the regular price of $24.99. This latest update follows multiple other character updates since the game arrived in July 2023.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Level-5 has been updating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> on a regular basis since it arrived on the Switch and Switch 2 last November, and it's now announced the game's third major (<em>and free</em>) update.</p>
<p>It's officially titled '<strong>Orion &amp; Lumen DLC</strong>' and will be launching next week on <strong>25th February 2026</strong>. Here's the announcement, and you can see this update in action in the official trailer at the top of the page.</p>

<p>Nintendo has this week surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade</a> fans with a Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>. There is also a paid upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<p>To celebrate the Switch 2 version, Nintendo has also revived the game's themed icons for Switch Online members. Yes, in case you missed it, there are four waves over four weeks, and the first wave is now officially live. As usual, they'll cost <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong> each, and background and borders are priced at <strong>5 Platinum Points</strong> each.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82sozirl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>If you haven't already pulled the trigger on the Switch 2 upgrade for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, it will cost you <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Or you can get the Switch 2 Edition for <strong><em>£</em>54.99 / $64.99</strong>. A physical release has also been confirmed and is arriving in April. Whatever you choose, expect 4K and up to 60fps in docked, and 1080p and up to 60fps in handheld.</p>
<p>Here's what we had to say about the Switch 2 Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition in our hands on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the smallest paid Switch 2 Edition yet from Nintendo, providing <em>only</em> a resolution bump (1080p handheld, 4K docked) and performance boost (a steady 60fps both handheld and docked). But it's hard not to be impressed when you see Monolith Soft's vision be fully realised on-screen. It's amazing we've never had a <strong>Xenoblade</strong> game at 60fps before this, and it's a real showcase of just how much more beautiful and smooth these worlds can look."</p>
