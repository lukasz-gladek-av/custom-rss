<p>Following a recent story about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-demo-kiosks-are-being-spotted-in-us-stores">Switch 2 kiosks popping up in US stores</a>, we've now got a small but exciting update.</p>
<p>If the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct left you wanting to play the game right now, apparently a demo of the game has been added to these same kiosks at locations like Walmart and Target in the US. You can enjoy ten whole minutes of this upcoming release.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn't said if it will be making this demo, or anything similar, available on the Switch 2 eShop, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you don't have access to one of these kiosks, there's not long to go now – with the full release of Donkey Kong Bananza scheduled to land next month on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. Nintendo is also releasing a new DK and Pauline amiibo on the same date.</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Ganondorf face collage" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103f98688c570/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ganondorf-face-collage.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>You know what would make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> much easier? A herd of Epona. In terms of making it harder? How about multiple Ganondorfs? Well, you can have all that and more thanks to an exploit discovered by the TOTK community. (Thanks <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/feature/what-happens-if-you-send-glitched-items-to-zelda-notes/">GamingReinvented</a>!).</p>
<p>With the new Zelda Notes companion app (compatible only with the Switch 2 Edition), it's possible to share Autobuild creations by uploading them to the app in-game, which then creates a QR code that you can share online. When someone scans that code in and uploads it to the game, voila, they have your Autobuild creation ready to roll.</p>
<p>Those with modded save files have been taking advantage of this feature in hilarious ways, uploading QR codes for "creations" that range from food, bubbles, items locked to shrines, and, uh, Ganondorf. Complete with a health bar and ready to absolutely destroy Link. He'll follow him absolutely everywhere, too, unless you fast travel away.</p>
<p>For something a little more relaxing than being chased by Demon King Ganondorf, there are codes that allow you to summon multiple Epona too — all of this demonstrated over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/1ledk4e/totk_autobuild_sharing_is_so_broken/#lightbox">tearsofthekingdom subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>How is this possible, though? It requires modded save data and access to a modded Switch 1 with TOTK, before transferring the save data to Switch 2. But, essentially, in the save data, you can change any part of an Autobuild to any kind of 'actor' or item.</p>
<p>So, as long as you find a QR code that lets you summon the respective item or character you want (we won't share them here, though they're relatively easy to hunt down), then you can go ahead and cause a different kind of chaos in Hyrule.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering; yes, you can summon an army of good boys, too.</p>

<p><em>Let us know what you think of this amusing exploit in the comments below</em>.</p>

<p>Sub-layers of new info</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're all still hyped full of bananergy after yesterday's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025">Direct</a> and, if you're anything like us, you'll likely have been straight onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/">official Nintendo website</a> to check out further details. Standard practice.</p>
<p>However, as we've found over the past 24 hours or so, jumping onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html?m=stage">Japanese version of the site</a> reveals a Donkey Kong Bananza section that has a bunch more details than we've got so far in the US/UK. Indeed, our man Zion has been breaking down the Direct, whilst also digging into new deets he's uncovered on said Japanese site, and well, there's lots juicy stuff to pick at here.</p>
<p>You can check out Zion's video for yourself up top for a much more detailed round-up of everything, but of particular interest here is that he's been looking at the sub-layers (that is, the levels that make up the world that you dig down through in the game) and attempting to piece them all together using both the Direct trailer and the extra details found tucked away on Nintendo's Japanese site.</p>


<p>By doing so, he's attempted to order the nine levels he believes are included, as they'll appear in the game, even digging into some of the minigames and deducing where they may show up.</p>
<p>The levels Zion's managed to work out thus far <em>seem</em> to appear in the game in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingot Isle</li>
<li>Lagoon Layer</li>
<li>Hilltop Layer</li>
<li>Canyon Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Ice &amp; Lava'</li>
<li>Forest Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Beach'</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there's info still missing here, including two missing areas and some names that are placeholders. It certainly gives us a much easier-to-grasp overview of how this one may flow, and an early idea of just how much variety there's gonna be in this one when it drops in just a few weeks' time.</p>
<p>Other juicy details that Zion has picked out in this breakdown include some returning tracks from DK games of the past, as well as a whole bunch of other stuff that, we'll be honest, we'd never have noticed without him!</p>
<p>It's fascinating — and very exciting — stuff for anyone who's been waiting years for a new DK game. Bananza really is beginning to look like a surprisingly inventive banger, and the full breakdown gives lots of details on each area too, so go check it out!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-im-completely-in-love-with-mario-kart-worlds-photo-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a7165cabc459/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is the biggest Mario Kart to date. The map is huge, with Easter Eggs and little secrets hiding under bridges, atop towering buildings, and in the middle of sprawling oceans. Knockout Tour is the most chaotic concoction of multiplayer I've ever seen. And I'm still knee-deep in unlocking characters (darn, Kamek...).</p>
<p>And yet, here I am to talk about photo mode. <em>Bloody</em> photo mode, you're probably thinking. A modern-day video game checkbox. Probably 60% of games have a photo mode nowadays, either at launch or patched in at a later date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> are just a few Nintendo first-party games that have some way of taking expressive pics of your characters.</p>
<p>But, news flash, I love it in Mario Kart World more than any of those other games.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb7ab61f2bbb7/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look, see, a <em>real</em> newsflash! — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having spent a <em>lot</em> of time with Mario Kart World over the past couple weeks, and absolutely loving it, it's not the deeper mechanics, the chaotic racing, or the chillness of exploring the open world that have really stuck with me. It's how loud and expressive it lets you be, both in and out of the game. I touched on it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">in my review</a> in terms of the animations and visuals, but I think this applies across everything, particularly photo mode.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, Nintendo seems to have given Mario a new lease of life. Remakes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi</a> entry are indicative of that (Odyssey also just about fits the bill). These games represent Mario, Luigi, and a whole host of other characters, old and new, at their most colourful, their most jovial, and their most <em>stupid</em> in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World carries that torch but in an entirely new setting — not a 2D platformer or turn-based RPG, not even with any dialogue. This is a kart racer with over 100 costumes, multiple biomes, and 50 different characters ranging from classics like Peach and Wario to the stupidest of choices, like the Cow, Cataquack, and Peepa. I can drive around as <em>Peepa</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario 3D Land</a>.</p>
<p>Photo mode, to me, is an extension of the daft playfulness that's alive and well in the Mushroom Kingdom right now. It goes beyond just being an easy, fun way of sharing screenshots online or with friends. As with the best photo modes, it's about expressing yourself and the moment.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm way too deep into this, but a lot goes into a Mario Kart World photo. Which character would suit which location? What about the kart? Or a bike? Which costume? Do I want other racers in the shot? Enemies? Which pose looks best? What mood do I want to convey? Do I use a frame?</p>
<p>I'm not a professional photographer — please don't ask me to take good photos of any animal that isn't my cat — but when it comes to these kinds of shots, with this variety of characters? I'm all in.</p>
<p>Let's take Yoshi in his Biker outfit, for example. He <em>has</em> to be in the W-Twin Chopper (nothing else goes with those shades), and we need somewhere either suitably muddy <em>or</em> very cool to look effortless. So, off to Choco Mountain I went, driving around, looking for the best spots to frame my photo.</p>
<p>The muddy chocolate makes things a little tougher around here; you'll drown if you stay in it too long, and item boxes weren't giving me Mushrooms so I could zip over the little pools. But then a Feather and a curved wall gave me the chance to do something that looks easy as hell, but really isn't. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-wall-ride">Wall riding</a>...</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43375c8436a0d/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Et voilà! Something that conveys a very cute character, looking very cool in the moment, with shades, a leather jacket, and a very suitable vehicle.</p>
<p>Or, you know, sometimes I just get really stupid ideas and decide to put Bowser, in a similar biker outfit, in Lil' Dumpy. As soon as I unlocked the costume for the king of Koopas, I knew immediately I was going to do something ridiculous with it. And, there you have it:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a911293fce4e8/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I don't always use frames, but when I do... — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a franchise with over 40 years of history behind it, Mario has done a <em>lot</em> of things, and that also gives me a chance to relive, and re-experiment, with those moments. One of my favourite shots was a complete coincidence as I was driving around collecting P Switches in the snowy regions of Free Roam.</p>
<p>I went off-road after driving down from Starview Peak, hoping to find a big, blue button to bash my head against multiple times. But what I got instead was a goldmine: A group of penguins gathered around an oil drum.</p>
<p>Nintendo references Mario's hatred of penguins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mq4uCJDwO9U?si=ZRWLAc_HKVcnb8Y4&amp;t=726">in the Mario Kart World Direct</a> (we've all thrown the penguin off of Cool, Cool Mountain in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, right?), but what if the penguin wanted to take revenge? Luckily, penguin just happens to be a character in Mario Kart World, and in my eyes, he craves <em>violence</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51fd5573ded2f/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the sheer expressiveness of the game and the vastness of the world, the moment-to-moment action is just so easy to snapshot, and because every single moment can cause complete chaos, there are so many chances to put characters in danger for the sheer sake of art.</p>
<p>This makes me sound bad, doesn't it? I'm sure if Mario and friends were real, they'd hate me for putting them in perilous situations. But they're not all life-threatening; firing Daisy out of barrel cannons on the bridge between Faraway Oasis and Crown City is just kind of delightful, and getting into a heated contest with your brother brings out the drama.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, and all of that hooting and hollering while you're racing — groaning from being hit by a Blue Shell or cheering as you knock your best friend off the course and push them down 10 places in an instant — can be <em>captured</em> in an instant.</p>
<p>Plus, we can finally find out what happens when a Cataquack encounters another Cataquack:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/597826d37dddb/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Knockout Tour is still my favourite thing about this game, and in those moments where I'm scrambling to make it into the top 16, or top 8, or simply just aim to win, I forget all about taking snapshots because I'm on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>But when I do want to channel my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Macmillan">Iain Macmillan</a> or <a href="https://www.kymillman.com/photography/formula-1/?srsltid=AfmBOoojdRYkIwFQ2bUpN7gdY_TmHRD08qkIuwYam7MZ0JfTlNyISzbx">Kym Illman</a>, Mario Kart World lets me capture the action, the calm, the fun, and the drama, with aplomb. May Mario and friends <em>always</em> feel this alive and expressive. I can't wait to mess around with it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, too.</p>
<p>Or, you know, I could just admire the food. I <em>need</em> those Boo Buns in my life.</p>

<h3>The Nintendo Life Mario Kart World Photo Gallery</h3>
<p>As a little bonus, I thought it would be fun to round up a few shots from the NL Crew of their Mario Kart World escapades.</p>
<p>First up is reviewer extraordinaire PJ, who's making sure Mario gets some exercise in while riding along the high roads. Good for him! Love the little Baby Blooper, too — one of my favourite four-wheel vehicles in the game</p>

<p>Okay, next is a DK pic from our esteemed editor Gavin. Oh, uh, erm...no! Stop. Oh god... it's a photo of the popular Nintendo character Donkey Kong, as supplied by Gavin, you dirty people. There's some Waluigi here too, so you can keep your minds out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>buns</em>. We like buns, right?</p>

<p>Following on from <em>that</em> fiasco, we have my trusty P Switch comrade Jim; he's taken a shine to the lovely little Monty Mole. Simple, effective, adorable — and look, there's even <em>another</em> Monty! Thanks, Moo Moo Meadows!</p>

<p>Last, but absolutely not least, Ollie has caught Baby Mario in the act — how on earth did he manage to get the biggest ice cream?? Also, thanks Ollie for reminding me that bees can be dangerous. Good for nature, not good for... crabs?</p>
