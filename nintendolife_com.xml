<figure data-uuid="3b741c1e1c313"><a title="Read Dead Redemption" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b741c1e1c313/read-dead-redemption.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Rockstar Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>'s release for the Switch in 2023, a new ESRB rating indicates that the game may soon be receiving a native Switch 2 port.</p>
<p>As detailed on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">ESRB website</a>, Read Dead Redemption has been rated for the PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch 2. The accompanying text naturally details what kind of content is included to warrant the 'Mature 17+' rating, including "Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, and Use of Drugs".</p>
<p>We're not certain what kind of upgrades we'll be getting on the Switch 2, but we would expect to see stable 60fps gameplay along with a pretty sizeable boost in resolution in both docked and handheld modes. Perhaps the multiplayer mode, which was cut from the Switch release, will also make its return here.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnO48QYAS9Kg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9ftkzqnv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/red-dead-redemption">review</a> for the Switch release, we awarded it a score of 8/10 and said that Red Dead Redemption is "a proper all-timer ported successfully to Switch and, if you can stump up the cash, you'll have a great time here regardless of the lack of TLC".</p>
<p>Rumours have been circulating for a while now to indicate that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> might also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-port-for-switch-2-really-does-exist-its-claimed">receive a Switch 2 release</a>, but nothing official has been announced yet. The sequel / prequel originally launched in 2018 to critical acclaim and saw players take on the role of gang member Arthur Morgan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar Games' <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA VI</a> has been delayed again, with the highly-anticipated title now launching on 19th November 2026.</p>

<p>We are drawing ever closer to the release of Dotemu and Tribute Games' next side-scrolling beat 'em up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, on <strong>1st December</strong>, and the devs have returned to give us another deep dive into some gameplay.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/marvel-cosmic-invasion-devs-showcase-every-fighter-in-the-upcoming-beat-em-up">last video of this ilk</a> was all about the diverse character roster, this fresh peek gives us our best look yet at the tag-team-style 'Cosmic Swap' ability, which lets you sub in a new hero at the tap of a button.</p>
<p>We had spotted a bit of this arcade-inspired feature in previous trailers, but it's nice to have the minds behind the game run us through its intricacies.</p>
<p>"Gameplay-wise, the Cosmic Swap is an amazing tool," Game Director Frederic Gemus explains in the vid, "because it not only helps you address different situations with different characters, but also enables you to extend your combos by swapping mid-way and creating these amazing-looking combat sequences, or even just call in an assist so your teammate can take care of an enemy while you're taking care of another one."</p>
<p>It sounds like there's a good layer of depth to it all, too. Whether you want to tackle an enemy from a different angle or plan ahead to achieve a slick combo, the Cosmic Swap ability looks like it'll be something that we'll be using <em>a lot</em> in each and every playthrough.</p>
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion arrives digitally on Switch and Switch 2 next month for <strong>£26.99 / $29.99</strong>.</p>
