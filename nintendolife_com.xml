<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now available on the Switch and Switch 2, and the first Mystery Gift distribution event has officially gone live.</p>
<p>In case you missed the initial announcement, The Pokémon Company will be offering trainers across the globe an "early-purchase bonus" in the form of a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite stone as a gift. When trained, Ralts evolves into Kirlia and then Gardevoir. From there, it can be Mega Evolved into Mega Gardevoir.</p>
<p>Along with this, the digital version early-purchase bonus includes a "gift of 100 Poké Balls". Both of these gifts will be available to claim until <strong>28th February, 2026</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2wgsltm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>As mentioned in the promotion above, it takes "approximately one hour of play time" before you can access the Mystery Gift feature. <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii.net</a> adds to this with some additional information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mystery Gift is unlocked after you get the Pokédex in the game story. If you already have the Gardevoirite stone by the time you receive it, the Ralts will not have an item attached."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with previous Pokémon games, we'll be sharing all future distribution events for Legends: Z-A here on Nintendo Life. We'll also have a guide up on the site soon.</p>

<p>This bumps the game up to Version 5.5.2, and according to the patch notes, it fixes an issue with League Battles tied to Switch 2 and Switch users. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Splatoon 2 - Ver. 5.5.2 (Released October 15, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Fixed an issue with League Battles where, when both Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch users were included in the eight players who battled, sometimes League Power did not change after the battle."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If there's anything else discovered about this latest software update, we'll let you know. The patch before this (Version 5.5.1) was released in November 2022.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also released a bunch of other Switch patches recently, including updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and even the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> title.</p>

<p>No sensitive data appears to have been compromised</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c11f95762e385"><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11f95762e385/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, the hacking group Crimson Collective <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/notorious-group-crimson-collective-claims-to-have-hacked-nintendo">claimed it had breached Nintendo</a>. At the time, there was no official response from the video game giant.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, Nintendo has shared a statement with <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, and it appears to suggest there's been no personal, development, or business-related leaks.</p>
<p>Some external servers displaying Nintendo's website have reportedly been compromised, but there's apparently no evidence of this impacting customers or the company. Here's a rough translation including the statement shared on 15th October 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo responded to an interview with the Sankei Shimbun on the 15th, saying, "We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information." Some external servers that display Nintendo's website were defaced, but the company said there was no evidence of damage to customers or intrusion into the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, at this stage, there's been no personal data leaked, and it seems there seemingly won't be any secrets popping up about the company's games or business operations.</p>
<p>This update follows a story from earlier this week about the supposed hacker behind the Pokémon 'Teraleak' reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-z-as-source-code-and-beta-builds-have-now-supposedly-leaked">leaking the new game's source code</a> and beta builds.</p>
