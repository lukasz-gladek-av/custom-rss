<p>We've had our eyes on this long-lost GBA-looking adventure ever since we first discovered it at Gamescom <a href="https://x.com/ZionDood/status/1826268852617126059">back in 2024</a>. The combat, movement, and visuals instantly reminded us of the handheld Zelda entries, but instead of a sword, the main protagonist uses a yoyo to dispatch foes and solve loads of puzzles. You've also got a spunky, blue bat protagonist that looks like they jumped straight out of the SNES era. What's not to love here?!</p>
<p>Pocket Trap's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> comes to Switch this week, and to celebrate we linked up with the Game Director and Lead Programmer <strong>Henrique Lorenzi</strong> to ask some questions about his love for yoyos, Nintendo's games, and Yoko Shimomura.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:179410 @ 1767009605 -->

<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: We played through the free demo you have on the Switch eShop, and we loved how</strong> <strong>versatile an item the yoyo is for Pippit! Do you remember when you had that lightbulb</strong> <strong>moment, when you knew you wanted to build a game around a yoyo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Henrique Lorenzi:</strong> As game designers, we’ve found that one of the best ways to create enjoyable experiences is to take objects that the player is familiar with in the real world and transform them into gameplay mechanics. We’ve made it a habit to set up a board at the beginning of every project, where the entire team can participate by throwing in ideas. So we had a board full of images of ordinary objects like a hammer, a slingshot, a baseball bat, a hand saw, roller skates – you name it! The yoyo was special, though.</p>
<p>Not only could it be considered a 'cool kid’s' item, but the gameplay ideas involving it started pouring in non-stop! At that point, the lightbulb lit up, as you said – we realised this item would allow for a pretty extensive and deep game! We started sketching game screens, thinking about how the various challenges would play out – it was at this point that we also incorporated diagonals to the level design, which are places where the yoyo can bounce off of and help extend your range. Everything felt solid, and we were confident we had some great game-design possibilities in our hands!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e8fb113110385"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8fb113110385/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Early development sketches — <em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Did the yoyo start life as anything else originally, or did you always know you wanted the main weapon to be one?</strong></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to make some kind of a 'Zelda-like' game, but try to stray away from medieval fantasy themes. So we were looking for an item that could replace the sword in combat. After we stumbled upon the humble yoyo, we noticed a pretty strong point in its favour: differently to the usual approach of having the player juggle a wide range of items that each enable a certain action – like having weapons for combat, a boomerang for puzzle-solving, and special boots for wall-jumping and platforming –, the yoyo would be able to cover all of these use-cases on its own!</p>
<p>The player’s progression would be tied to the knowledge of particular yoyo tricks, so it perfectly translated the experience someone might have with the real thing. And regarding the game’s setting and themes, the yoyo provided a great opportunity to take everything into the contemporary era! So you’re a radical kid using your favourite toy in a modern-world city with modern-world problems. We had hit the perfect combo for the relatable experience we wanted to create!</p>
<p><strong>From the demo alone, we can see a lot of Nintendo’s DNA in Pipistrello. This really does look and feel like something that would have been released on the GBA! What games in particular do you feel the team drew inspiration from?</strong></p>
<p>I’m so glad you’ve noticed this! We’re longtime Nintendo fans, and everyone on the team has grown up playing Nintendo games. The Game Boy Advance really felt like peak handheld gaming back in the day, so we were excited at the possibility of bringing a nostalgic feeling to players familiar with it. We’ve even added an optional 3D Console mode to the game that simulates the experience of playing on a real GBA, including responsive buttons, an adjustable and rotatable camera, and – get this – even glare from the screen if you hold it at just the right position!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e5f334052a4bc"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5f334052a4bc/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But of course, we didn’t want to just mimic the thing, but also modernise the gaming experience and make it appealing to new players as well: the physics engine has lots of quality-of-life improvements – such as coyote-time, corner-sliding, landing assist, and magnetic edges – and if you get a Game Over you can restart from the same screen without any downtime. One of our aspirations was perhaps to create a new source of joy that could be passed down through generations, just like Nintendo has.</p>
<p>Speaking of games that have inspired us, I’d say the most direct have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">The Minish Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a>, but we also took a page from older and newer games alike – from the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> on the NES, to the latest entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the world map and exploration? Will there be interconnected areas like in a Metroidvania, or will there be sections that have a start and a finish, much like a Zelda dungeon?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a bit of everything in Pipistrello! The navigation around the city is completely interconnected, with branching and merging paths. The city map is fully filled in and massive, so you can bet there will be something interesting no matter what direction you go in, and on top of everything, it’s teeming with secrets! Did I mention we also have a second layer to the entire city? Players can drop below to the sewers level and explore even more sprawling environments – something akin to the Dark World or the Depths!</p>
<p>Beyond that, once you reach a dungeon or mini-dungeon, the experience becomes more like a classic Zelda – strongly thematic and narrative-driven experiences which emphasise one or more specific game mechanics. Remember we kept our themes contemporary, so our dungeons take place in a police department, a shopping mall, a skyscraper mid-construction, a pop-culture convention, a sports stadium, and more! I think players will have a blast unravelling each location’s lore and secrets.</p>

<p><strong>We had a blast with the demo, but we found the Don Mauretti boss fight particularly challenging! We liked how theoretically you could defeat him with simple yoyo strikes, but you could deal more damage by bouncing the yoyo off walls. Will the game have any sort of difficulty options, and on a scale of 1 to 10, how tough do you think he is in comparison to other bosses in the game?</strong></p>
<p>It does feel way more challenging in the demo! That fight has been tailored for players with many hours of experience in the game, and we didn’t want to nerf the boss for the demo and risk losing the interesting bits. We offer three scenarios in the demo so that players can have a taste of different parts of the game, but these scenarios aren’t consecutive in the full game at all. At the point you go against Don Mauretti in the full game, the player will have access to many Badges and Upgrades, not to mention Charged and Special Moves such as the Parry and the Flurry Attack – all things that the full game introduces at an appropriate pace, providing detailed explanations and training areas to practice – so we’re confident the player will have the ability and the tools necessary to overcome these fights! The game’s progression is not linear, so a player can even explore other city districts and fight other bosses before going into Don Mauretti’s turf.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the game also offers several difficulty settings, which allow the player to fine-tune the gameplay experience to suit their tastes, both to the easier side as well as the harder side. We’d say Don Mauretti is about a 7 or 8 on the difficulty scale, and the four main bosses have all been designed to display a similar level of challenge. These four main bosses serve as the final trial on the player’s mastery journey throughout each city district and dungeon, so each one offers something different in terms of required skills and fight dynamics. But don’t forget there are still other bosses and mini-bosses (and secret bosses!) for the player to track down and fight!</p>
<p><strong>We also noticed some issues with the frame rate dropping pretty substantially in the final section of the Don boss fight (we were playing in handheld mode.) Do you hope to have those issues worked out for the full launch on Switch?</strong></p>
<p>After the demo launched, we’ve gone through extensive optimisation passes on the Nintendo Switch. We’re so sorry about your previous experience! Now I can say that all areas of the game run perfectly smoothly, including the boss fight you mentioned, no matter if you’re playing it docked or handheld! The Nintendo Switch is a priority of ours, and we’ve put a lot of work into it, with things like HD Rumble support tailored for each action Pippit can take. We believe it’s one of the best platforms to enjoy the game on! The updated demo should be available shortly on the Nintendo eShop, so you don’t have to just take my word for it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c1e9959f1db1d"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1e9959f1db1d/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>We took a look through the developer credits and we noticed you have Yoko Shimomura on the team composing the soundtrack! Whoa! Can you talk about the process of pitching the game to her and what it’s been like working with her?</strong></p>
<p>Having grown up with Nintendo games, we’ve naturally grown up attached to Yoko Shimomura’s work as well! With our idea to develop a GBA-inspired game, who else would be most suited to bring on board if not her? We felt that, taking into account her work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> and the <strong>Mario &amp; Luigi</strong> series, and especially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga">Superstar Saga</a> on the GBA, she could bring unmatched authenticity to Pipistrello’s retro design aesthetic, and it could result in the game being elevated even more towards that Nintendo standard we were seeking. Naturally, it was kind of nerve-wracking contacting a world-class composer like her for the first time! We didn’t know if she’d even agree to working with us.</p>
<p>We knew she could have a very tight schedule, so we made sure to pitch this to her very early on – we sent out the first email one whole year before production actually started! (Maybe that was an excessively long time? But it pays to think in advance!) Much to our surprise, she was very open to the idea! We sent her full documents describing the game and the setting, along with screenshots and videos of the areas she’d be composing for, as well as some musical references (some of them her own songs!)</p>
<p>I imagine it must have been quite a surprise to her that we weren’t looking for a full orchestral sound, but we actually asked for the production to take a step back and embrace the GBA era! So she employed some of those vintage Roland Sound Canvas synthesisers used back in the day, for a real throwback. We were extremely happy with the experience, and will most definitely be looking to repeat this partnership in the future! I hope players will keep an ear out while playing the game!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, we have to know...does anyone on the development team know any rad, real-world yoyo tricks? Bonus points if they can prove it!</strong></p>
<p>As kids, we had a lot of contact with toy yoyos, and companies were even packaging them with snacks and soda. But that’s hardly anything that allows us to be considered enthusiasts, let alone professionals at the yoyo.</p>

<p>That said, we did actually go deep into research while developing Pipistrello, watching yoyo competition videos, learning the theory behind a multitude of tricks, and speaking with people who know this topic way better than us!</p>
<p>Some people on the team obtained professional yoyos during development to aid in the creative process (and played around with them for a bit), and one of us actually has more experience with the diabolo, a related apparatus. All in all, though, I think becoming a yoyo champion is a fantasy best left to Pippit at this point, haha!</p>

<p>Could an upgrade be on the way?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Since the Switch 2 generation got underway, many Nintendo fans have been hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> titles to receive a next-generation upgrade. Now, in an interesting development, a Switch 2 rating has surfaced on the European age rating board PEGI for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>This rating was apparently filed by 'Nintendo of Europe SE' on 28th December 2025 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pikmin-3-deluxe-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe">thanks, Gematsu</a>). It's 'PEGI 3' (the same classification as the Switch game listed), contains "occasional, very mild violence in a comical or abstract context" and is suitable for all ages.</p>
<p>The same brief outline of the game is also attached to this rating, but no other significant details have been shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Pikmin 3 Deluxe, players take command of three explorers and a legion of adorable Pikmin in a fight for survival. By employing the unique abilities of these tiny Pikmin creatures, players will solve puzzles, battle dangerous predators and recover food needed to save the explorers' depleted home planet."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> made its debut in 2020 and follows the original Wii U entry from 2013. The Switch version of the game received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pikmin-3-deluxes-new-update-fixes-screen-flicker-issue-when-playing-on-switch-2">small update in June of this year</a>, improving the gameplay experience on Switch 2, but there has been no upgrade for the title so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> also received a free content update in November, adding new content and new modes.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously released free and paid Switch 2 upgrades for existing Switch titles. This included <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free Switch game updates</a> when the new hybrid system launched in June.</p>

This article was originally published in May. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This article delves into spoiler territory for The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy. If you've yet to play the game and want to go in blind, we recommend you come back at another time...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not a fan of tactical RPGs… is what I would have told you before I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. Heck, I’m still not sure I would call myself a 'fan' of the genre, necessarily; one game perhaps isn’t enough to sway me <em>that</em> much. The Hundred Line, though..? Yeah, I’m a fan of The Hundred Line.</p>
<p>In fact, it's easily my Game of the Year so far, and even with the Switch 2 on the horizon, it’s going to take something truly special to usurp its throne. Mitch gave it an 'Excellent' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">9/10 in our review</a>, but what he didn’t cover – what he <em>couldn’t</em> cover without spoiling anything – is just how ridiculously ambitious Too Kyo Games’ visual novel / tactical RPG hybrid really is.</p>
<p>So, if you’re sensitive about spoilers and want to go into this one completely fresh, consider this your last warning. We’re going in, folks.</p>

<p>Before I waltz headfirst into what is undoubtedly The Big Twist™, I want to first look at the wonderful cast of characters. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> before it, the entire premise of The Hundred Line — survive and protect your school against invaders over the course of one hundred days — would have crashed and burned were it not for the likes of Takumi Sumino, Darumi Amemiya, Shouma Ginzaki, Nozomi Kirifuji, and the rest of those loveable goofballs.</p>
<p>Character work is truly where directors Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi shine brightest. They managed to make every member of the 'Special Defense Unit' completely unique and special in their own way.</p>
<p>Take Tsubasa Kawana, for instance. Whenever she’s placed in a stressful situation, she immediately feels nauseous, and it makes for some wonderful comedic relief. I lost count of the number of times I giggled whenever the story took a dark turn, and the camera switched over to Tsubasa loudly dry heaving.</p>
<p>In addition to the comic relief, however, we also learn a lot about Tsubasa’s background, including her passion for machinery fostered by fixing cars with her grandfather as a child. We get similar deep dives into every character, to the point where we begin to understand the potential causes behind their various quirks. Even total prats like Ima Tsukumo, whose obsessive devotion to his ‘Dear Sister’ Kako proves deeply concerning, gets his own moment of redemption through both his backstory and the way the plot progresses.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the credits, I really didn’t want the game to end. I’d grown to love these characters, and a couple of significant losses actually brought a tear to my eye during the final stages; something that no game before it has accomplished. Couldn’t I just keep going? Just for a bit..?</p>
<p>Well, here’s the thing: it didn’t end.</p>
<p>When you reach the last couple of days in the basic hundred-day timeline, you learn that through powers gained via absorption of your enemies, protagonist Takumi can actually go back in time to day one and re-do the whole thing again. Only this time, you’re free to make significant changes to the story and work your way toward one of a potential hundred different endings. <em>Whoa</em> – hold my beer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a>!</p>
<figure data-uuid="c8e60d5045326"><a title="The Hundred Line 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8e60d5045326/the-hundred-line-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know what you’re probably thinking, and no, you don’t have to play through the <em>entire</em> game a hundred times. Effectively, the story can branch off into several different paths, each of which has a number of potential endings, and the game even gives you the ability to jump back to specific days in order to change your decisions and alter the story’s path.</p>
<p>Some endings may be exceedingly short, others a bit lengthier… some good, and some <em>very</em> bad. One might see you become the villain of the story, while another may conclude with the adorably loyal samurai Kyoshika Magadori being devoured by your zombified friends. The variety of avenues is simply absurd, and discovering each one is a joy.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of the more, shall we say, ‘insignificant’ possible endings. I won’t go into those which might actually spoil the overarching plot; even if you’re still with me at this point, I’d like you to enjoy The Hundred Line’s story on your own terms. It’s safe to say, however, that the run through those initial one hundred days could definitely be considered a ‘prologue’, even though it comfortably stands as a compelling story in its own right with a beginning, middle, and end.</p>

<p>So you can definitely stop there and have a grand ol’ time, but if you’re looking for something a bit more ambitious — something that throws the rulebook out of the window — I’d encourage you to keep going and see exactly what The Hundred Line has up its sleeve. It’s simply magnificent.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons why I love this game. I love figuring out what to do during ‘free time’ sessions in which you can either chat to your fellow students, venture out into the world in a board-game-inspired minigame of sorts, or dive straight into a few battle simulations to potentially upgrade your abilities.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise for me, however, was how much I loved the battle system itself. As I mentioned at the start, I’m normally not one for tactical RPGs, but The Hundred Line’s turn-based structure just works so well. I often get overwhelmed when it comes to deciding how to approach tactical gameplay: how do these characters function? Why can’t I move more than two spaces? Just what the heck do I <em>do</em>?</p>
<p>The Hundred Line made it easy, though, and it’s once again thanks to the remarkably unique and diverse cast. Their artistic design makes it easy to distinguish one from another, and it only took a couple of battles until I memorised their strengths and weaknesses, along with how their attacks play out on the field of battle. It got to the point where, after a handful of quiet days full of ‘free time’, the warbling alarm to signify an incoming battle filled me with excitement.</p>

<p>Most of the battles felt doable and I never felt completely helpless against the hordes of invaders, but there were still a few that I managed to botch straight away and lose within just a few minutes. In those instances, the game gives you the option to redo the battle with significant boosts to your manpower, instantly giving you 300% 'voltage' (which essentially gives you three uses of your extra-powerful special attacks) and refilling your squad's health. Is it cheating? Sure, I <em>guess</em>... But it also makes the game significantly more approachable for tactical newcomers like myself.</p>
<p>I adore the Danganronpa series. I think they’re wonderful games that remain just as compelling now as they were back when they first launched, and if it weren’t for Danganronpa, I don’t think The Hundred Line would even exist. I have to be honest with myself, though… The Hundred Line is better. It’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Co-director Kazutaka Kodaka has <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1921370017678946504">recently confirmed</a> that the game is "selling well", but I still feel like not enough people are talking about it. I suspect, however, that as the years go by and more people play it through word of mouth, it’ll go down as one of the greatest visual novels of all time. There’s simply nothing else quite like it.</p>
