<p>In Japan, at least</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Folks will no doubt be aware of Kazutoshi Iida from the cult-classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> for 64DD and GameCube, but now two of the creator's earlier titles are heading to the Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_tail_of_the_sun">Tail of the Sun</a> (1996) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_aquanauts_holiday">Aquanaut's Holiday</a> (1995) both launched for the PS1 with western publication from Sony itself. Now, Artdink is reviving both titles as part of its ARTDINK GAME LOG preservation project. Tail of the Sun will launch in Japan on <strong>16th December 2025</strong>, while Aquanaut's Holiday will follow in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARTDINK GAME LOG is a project to port and re-release game titles previously developed by ARTDINK onto modern gaming hardware.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"It serves as a record (log) of ARTDINK's game development journey. By reviving past masterpieces using current technology and platforms, it delivers nostalgia and rediscovery to longtime fans, while offering an unprecedented experience to new players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're unaware of what these titles entail, Tail of the Sun is an open-world game of sorts in which you play as a caveman with an aim to reach the sun by stacking 'ivory' from mammoths tusks. Meanwhile, Aquanaut's Holiday is an underwater simulator set in the first-person perspective in which you explore the ocean, find treasure, and interact with deep-sea creatures.</p>
<p>No release has been confirmed for western audiences at this time, but we wouldn't be surprised to see both games at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Plus an increase for new-hires</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ba04dbd7d6d21"><a title="Sonic Mania" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ba04dbd7d6d21/sonic-mania.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html">has announced</a> that it is raising the salary for its full-time staff along with increasing the starting salary for new-hires over in Japan (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Starting from 1st April 2026, the base salary for full-time employees will raise by an average of around 10%. Sega is introducing a more flexible pay structure while also converting annual bonuses into base pay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the starting salary for new university graduates will see a similar 10% increase from 300,000 to 330,000 yen (approx $2,140).</p>
<p>In the press release (via machine translation), Sega said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[SEGA] will revise the salary levels of full-time employees at its Japanese subsidiary and raise the starting salary for new employees, with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices, and of recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega had already increased its employees' base salaries back in 2023 from 222,000 to 300,000 yen, so this latest news will no doubt be very welcome to workers over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-hit-by-mass-layoffs-as-part-of-global-restructuring">Square Enix recently announced widespread restructuring of its international workforce</a>, leading to layoffs across the UK, Europe, and the US. The progress report provided notes that the changes will lead to a saving of around around 3 billion yen, or roughly $19.6 million.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5b70fc2c352b4"><a title="PS5 / Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b70fc2c352b4/ps5-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping an eye on our weekly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/japanese-charts-dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-remake-shoves-pokemon-off-the-podium">Japanese Charts</a>, then you'll know that the Switch and Switch 2 have been consistently dominating the hardware space, with Sony's PS5 struggling to get a foothold in the region (and let's not even mention Xbox).</p>
<p>That's not to say it hasn't doesn't well, mind you, with the console surpassing a total of 7 million units across the Base model, Digital Edition, and Pro. But with the Switch 2 already well on its way to 3 million sales just five months after its launch, you can bet the higher-ups at Sony will be quaking in their shiny loafers.</p>
<p>So, as announced during the recent State of Play, a new region-locked PS5 Digital Edition will launch in Japan at 55,000 yen (approx $350), making it comfortably the cheapest console from Sony's lineup. By comparison, the regular Digital Edition is significantly more expensive at 72,980 yen (approx $473).</p>
<p>Now, if this sounds familiar, then it should, because Nintendo chose to go down the same route when it launched the Switch 2 back in June, offering a region-locked console for just 49,980 yen (approx $322). This proved to be a wise decision, with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/switch-2s-cheaper-region-locked-version-is-overwhelmingly-popular-among-japans-2-2-million-pre-order-applicants-survey-suggests/">data from initial lottery pre-orders</a> indicating that 69.7% of applicants opted for the region-locked console with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. A further 27.5% chose the region-locked console on its own, while only 2.9% went for the multi-language model.</p>
<p>So it seems safe to assume, then, that if it weren't for the cheaper region-locked Switch 2, the new console might not be enjoying such a strong start in Japan. Now that Sony is opting for the same approach, it seems like the company is getting increasingly desperate to close the gap before the Switch 2 completely crushes its competition.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting that for both companies, the yen is still pretty weak in Japan right now. It's been on an accelerating decline for a while, sinking to values not seen since the '90s. So it's no surprise to see Nintendo and Sony taking some pretty drastic steps in the region to shift product.</p>
<p>That said, the PS5 has proved to be a pretty major success worldwide, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ps5-sales-now-top-84-2-million-units-well-on-way-to-100-million-milestone">selling over 84.2 million units since its launch in 2020</a>. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">recently surpassed 10 million units worldwide</a>, with Nintendo forecasting a total of 19 million for the current financial year.</p>

<p>Pre-orders opening soon</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After cropping up back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</a> made another haunting appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play</a> showcase, and what do you know, it got a release date this time.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have announced that the next spooky remake will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>12th March 2026</strong>. Pre-orders open today on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series, though Koei Tecmo states that we Switch 2 fans will have to wait until "a later date" to bagsy our copies.</p>
<p>As the latest trailer showcases, the remake has seen a pretty substantial upgrade in the visual and sound departments, with Minakami Village and its wraiths packing an extra level of creepy detail. There are also some new features this time, including focus, zoom and filters for your Camera Obscura, and the ability to hold Mayu's hand for a much-needed health and spirit boost.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, the game's <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/zero/crimson-re/uk/specs/">official website</a> states that the Switch 2 version will run at 1080p / 30fps, with no support for HDR. That said, there is the option to move the Camera Obscura with gyro aiming in handheld mode, so that's something.</p>
<p>The game will soon be available to pre-order in both its standard and 'Digital Deluxe' forms — the latter of which throws in a digital soundtrack, digital artbook and a handful of bonus costumes for Mio and Mayu.</p>
