<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> is getting another First 4 Figures statue and if you're wondering what could be next, it's the classic and iconic title screen. To be precise, it's the screen from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> Sega Genesis release.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the official description, it's got Sonic's "signature smirk and finger pointed confidently upward" towards the winged emblem and the title banner. The final product may be <em>slightly</em> different and it's "coming soon" with pre-orders opening on <strong>8th July 2025</strong>. If you sign up to F4F with your email, you can also get $10 off when pre-orders go live. Pricing hasn't been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Along with the standard release, First 4 Figures will also be offering an "exclusive edition". Each statue will come with a limited edition numbering authentication card as well. As for the dimensions it's - <strong>W 14.7" / 37.5cm, D 7.4" / 19cm, H 8.2" / 21cm</strong>, and weighs <strong>4.8KG</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the other F4F Sonic figures previously released have been based on characters like Tails, Super Shadow, Amy, Knuckles, and even Metal Sonic.</p>
<p>In some other Sonic news, Sega recently revealed a <a href="https://youtu.be/dGFfyMB_GtA">partnership with McLaren</a> to promote the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.

<p>Update: It's still waiting on a dev kit</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-02T02:55:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 2nd Jul 2025, 3:55am</time>]:</strong> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> game director Guangyun Chen recently provided an update to the website <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-nintendo-switch-2-port-still-under-consideration-at-netease-if-they-ever-actually-get-a-dev-kit-for-it/">VideoGamer</a> about a possible Switch 2 release – noting how the team is still "in the process of obtaining the development machine". Once it's acquired this, NetEase intends to "conduct a thorough evaluation" and will make a decision.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals will enter its <a href="https://youtu.be/kIhLPAWKKsg">third season 'The Abyss Awakens'</a> next week on 11th July and is available as a free download.</p>
<p>This update follows other developers claiming they're in the same situation with the Switch 2 and do not have development kits just yet.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:180920 @ 1751442121 --><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 15th Feb, 2025 05:30 GMT]:</strong></p>
<p>The popular team-based hero title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> has experienced an incredibly successful launch and as it continues to grow developer NetEase Games is looking at new ways to expand the experience. While it's reportedly ruled out a release on the original Switch, it seems there's a real chance of the game coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Speaking to IGN at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu mentioned how the team was "already in contact with Nintendo" and was apparently working on getting some development kits, so the decision will come down to how the game performs on the system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're already in contact with Nintendo and working on [getting] some development kits. And whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This goal to provide a "great experience" was the same reason the developer chose to not release the game on the original Switch. So again, as long as it can provide "great performance" on Switch 2, it's "open" to a release on this platform.</p>
<p>This 6v6 team-based free-to-play sees you assemble an "all-star Marvel squad" made up of characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man, and work together by combining strategies and powers. It's available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, and includes cross-platform multiplayer.</p>

<p>With a new mob, equipment tier and more</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>'s ever-expanding world is getting another significant update in the future which will make copper more useful.</p>
<p>In a brief video, Mojang notes how this resource is "really abundant", gets mined a lot, but normally gets stored away. This is all set change in the next game drop – with the team planning to give it "more of a purpose".</p>
<p>This sees the release of copper chest, copper armor, copper tools and copper weapons today in Bedrock Beta and Preview.</p>
<p>This is the first time a tool and armor tier has been added since the Nether update. Copper is also easier to find than iron, so the team thinks this update will be helpful in the earlier stages of the game.</p>
<p>The Copper Golem from the 2021 Mob Vote (won by the Allay) has also been reinvented, with a more "engaging mechanic". The new design means it will take items from copper chests and put them in empty chests or one with a matching item to help with inventory management.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this Minecraft update in the video above, with ideas and plans subject to change "before the final release".</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67c00941a9d35/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're now just weeks out from the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> for the Switch 2 and the final previews are now rolling in.</p>
<p>Our very own Jim Norman has already shared his thoughts after three hours with this new 3D entry and he's already thinking it could be something special, despite some minor technical concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In its top-notch visuals, silky smooth movement and wealth of distractions, Donkey Kong Bananza is showing all the signs of becoming DK's greatest outing to date. Heck, it might even end up as a Nintendo all-timer, assuming those technical mishaps can stay as inconsequential as they seem to be."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8hpmqyt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, what did other outlets have to say? Starting with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-is-the-switch-2s-true-successor-to-super-mario-odyssey">IGN</a>, it suggested it might be the "Switch 2's real killer app":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It turns out that swapping out a mustachioed plumber for a tumbling hairy gorilla is appropriately transformative. Even in just those two hours, I was absolutely enamored with Donkey Kong’s personality, his sheer sense of strength and power, juxtaposed with his surprisingly speedy movement, and the satisfying destructibility of everything around him. As far as first impressions go, this is everything a 3D Donkey Kong game should be."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/i-played-donkey-kong-bananza-its-the-switch-2s-killer-app/">CNET</a> had similar thoughts, calling Donkey Kong Bananza the Switch 2's "killer ape":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 was already excellent but it feels even more vibrant now. With a few more big, exclusive games like this, the Switch 2 is going to become a must-get for a lot more people. Actually, that moment might already be here."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2">The Verge</a> enjoyed its time with the game, but was also unable to overlook some technical issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"During some hectic transitions, the frame rate took a noticeable dip, but gameplay was smooth for the most part, which is an achievement for a game that’s bursting with physics and particle effects. Also, when I was covering a lot of distance while flying in Bananza mode, there was a lot of texture pop-in. The game’s fast loading speeds, detailed character models, and vibrant worlds make it clear why this had to be a Switch 2 game, but the visual issues are a little disappointing to see on the new, more powerful hardware"<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/50307-hands-on-donkey-kong-bananza-reshapes-a-classic-franchise"><br></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/50307-hands-on-donkey-kong-bananza-reshapes-a-classic-franchise">GoNintendo</a> mentioned how DK's newest outing did a great job balancing the "moments of destruction" with other actions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Something else that I was able to appreciate more after spending more time with Bananza is how it balances those moments of destruction with more measured actions. I ran into several areas that forced me to curb my rampaging instincts. This isn’t designed to be a pure, wild punch-a-thon, and you will come across environments that require more finesse."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/3-hours-with-donkey-kong-bananza/">VGC</a> wasn't quite as taken with the destruction mechanic, but still thinks Bananza has "a lot of promise":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the main issue I have with Donkey Kong Bananza: by itself, I don’t think the destruction mechanic is particularly interesting, and the game appears to fall flat in the segments where you’re left to use it as means of exploration. Smashing through walls and floors rewards players with fossils – used for unlocking new outfits – and the occasional Banandium Gem, but it’s not all that fun, and other games have done it far better...That said, it’s really worth stressing I’ve only played the very early game"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on">Eurogamer</a> says its concerns about the gameplay have been eased, and thinks the formula "might just be a winner":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's much to do here, with a good amount of variety. The best thing I can say, in fact, is that the three hours I had with the game absolutely flew by, even if I spent much of it doing a lot of the same wrecking ball actions repeatedly. Time flying is always a sure-fire sign of something that's good - so this formula might just be a winner."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just a handful of previews that have only scratched the surface of DK's new game, so be on the lookout for our full review later this month when we deliver our final verdict and score.</p>

<p>Mintrocket "didn't apply" for controversial Best Independent Game nom</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dave the Diver" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30cf0aaf5317d/dave-the-diver.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDhhP5MwL6Q&amp;ab_channel=MINTROCKET">Nexon</a></em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> is undoubtedly one of the best games of 2023, but it found itself caught in a bit of a storm during awards season as at The Game Awards of that year, the fantastic diving game and restaurant management sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/is-dave-the-diver-an-indie-game-the-game-awards-host-weighs-in">was nominated for Best Independent Game</a>, despite it being created by a subsidiary of the huge South Korean developer and publisher Nexon.</p>
<p>Now Mintrocket CEO and writer and director on the game, Jaeho Hwang, has directly addressed the controversy in an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton Media</a>), stating that "it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves."</p>
<p>Hwang emphasises that the nominees for Best Independent Game are picked based on nomination system that developers cannot nominate themselves for. <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq">The Game Awards</a> website states that all nominees, regardless of categories, are "chosen by an international jury of over 100 global media and influencer outlets, selected for their history of critical video game evaluation", with specialised juries set up for particular categories.</p>
<p>"We did not intend for it to have an indie game feel" Hwang tells the publication, saying that "it's made by Nexon, so there's nothing indie about it".</p>
<p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique." It is, admittedly, pretty hard to put Dave The Diver in a labelled box like many other games, but just because something uses pixel art and has a completely unique premise and gameplay loop, doesn't mean it's independent.</p>

<p>Back when the discussion was rumbling, The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/is-dave-the-diver-an-indie-game-the-game-awards-host-weighs-in">shared his thoughts on the controversy</a> during a Twitch stream, where he said "independent can mean different things to different people," and that "we defer to our jury" on making those judgments. He did acknowledge that the studio itself comes from a "larger entity" but was (probably) created with a "relatively small budget".</p>
<p>All we'll say is that Dave The Diver is a fantastic game, and we loved it back on Switch. And we may well be revisiting it again soon as Mintrocket has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/dave-the-diver-is-getting-a-free-switch-2-upgrade-soon-says-mintrocket">the game is getting a free Switch 2 update "soon"</a>. It's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-dlc-swims-onto-switch-in-late-2025">getting some DLC</a>, but that's recently been delayed to 2026.</p>
