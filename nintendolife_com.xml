You don't need yet <em>another</em> reason to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, right? Well, you know us, we're here to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>GameStop has announced that it will be issuing a free tote bag (gasp!) for in-store pre-orders for Requiem on all available platforms. It depicts the ruined landscape of Racoon City with the game's title at the top. Form an orderly queue folks, come on now!</p>

<p>Look, to be serious for a moment, we know it's not the coolest pre-order bonus ever, but heck, it's free. For diehard fans of the series, it could be a cool little thing to hang off the end of a shelf, or something. We're grasping, sure, but still...</p>
<p>Regardless of where you wind up purchasing it, Resident Evil Requiem will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It sees the return of veteran Leon Kennedy and the introduction of FBI agent Grave Ashcroft, whose mother – Alyssa – was a key character in the classic PS2 title, Resident Evil: Oubreak.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Beloved Superhero Comedy Dispatch Is Seemingly Flying Onto Switch 2 Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/beloved-superhero-comedy-dispatch-is-seemingly-flying-onto-switch-2-next-year</link>
            <guid>1385890</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Well, here's a nice piece of news! Fresh off a couple of nominations at The Game Awards, it looks like AdHoc Studio's superhero workplace comedy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> will be flying onto Switch and Switch 2 early next year.</p>
<p>A surprise listing has popped up on the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">Australian eShop</a> (thanks to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dispatch-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-early-2026/">Vooks</a> for the heads up), displaying the game and a free Switch 2 upgrade with a planned <strong>29th January</strong> release date.</p>
<p>And hey, this is good news! For those who missed out this year, Dispatch is a new comedy from the writers of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_from_the_borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/wolf_among_us">The Wolf Among Us</a>. It sees you step into the shoes of Robert Robertson (superhero alias, Mecha Man), who's forced to take a job in a superhero dispatch centre after his mech suit is destroyed in battle.</p>
<p>Strategically sending out supes is one thing, but a large part of the game is built around your decisions <em>outside</em> the action, with each choice having the potential to send the story in vastly different directions.</p>
<p>All of this is supported by a <em>stacked</em> voice cast, featuring the likes of <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>'s Aaron Paul, <strong>The Batman</strong>'s Jeffrey Wright, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s Alanah Pearce, <strong>Critical Role</strong>'s Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham and many, <em>many</em> more.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Shape the Story<br>
In Dispatch, every decision you make influences the unfolding narrative. From banter in the breakroom to life-or-death situations in the field, your choices affect your relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path your own story takes.</p>
<p>&gt; Deploy Your Heroes<br>
Use the strategy map to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Balance the risks and rewards as you make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for your team and the city.</p>
<p>&gt; Manage Your Roster<br>
Managing heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero comes with quirks, flaws, and baggage you’ll need to navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.</p>
<p>Blending narrative, strategy, and humor, Dispatch explores what it means to be a hero, whether you're wearing a cape or behind a desk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Launching episodically earlier this year, Dispatch has gone on to rack up over 83,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/#app_reviews_hash">Overwhelmingly Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Steam</a>. Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/dispatch">Push Square</a> had this to say about the game's PS5 release: "While it's very light on meaningful gameplay, it tells a brilliantly paced, consistently entertaining superhero story that touches on some refreshingly adult themes".</p>
