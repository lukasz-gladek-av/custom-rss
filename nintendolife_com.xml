<p>Bethesda surprised us all today with the announcement that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> was heading to Switch 2 with a bunch of technical upgrades to boot. But with a game we've all seen <em>this many times</em>, would it really look all that different from the re-release we saw on Switch 1 back in 2022?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no longer, because Mr Alex Olney is here to reveal all! In the above video, we've got a side-by-side comparison of how Skyrim matches up on Switch 2 vs Switch 1, showcasing all the gameplay you could wish for.</p>
<p>As you'll see, there's certainly a bump on Switch 2, with the new release boasting "Enhanced resolution, improved load times, and optimised performance", but if you're expecting to see anything other than 'Skyrim, innit', think again.</p>
<p>We'll have our full thoughts on the latest version of Skyrim on Switch 2 soon enough. Until then, you can check out the S2 version either via a free upgrade (if you already own the Anniversary Edition on Switch 1), as a standalone purchase for £52.99, or via the base-game-to-anniversary-edition upgrade for £17.99.</p>
