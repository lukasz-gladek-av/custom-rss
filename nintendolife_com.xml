<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">As was discovered when OpenAI released its Sora video creation tool a while back</a>, it's laughably easy to get Project Genie to spit out copyright-infringing footage.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImZCakl0bmxFNGwiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY5NzI2L2dvb2dsZS1haS1wcm9qZWN0LWdlbmllLTMtd29ybGQtbW9kZWwtaGFuZHMtb24iLCJleHAiOjE3NzAxNDAwNTYsImlhdCI6MTc2OTcwODA1OH0.q5OBTD_V36-65oc1EGqPxKYCZF00c7ODvifvagVcwbA&amp;utm_medium=gift-link">The Verge's Jay Peters</a> – who has been given early access to the tool – has gleefully posted that he was able to "generate a bunch of Nintendo-inspired games. Including one featuring Link with a paraglider!" The footage, as you can clearly see, is so close to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> it's <em>almost</em> funny.</p>

<p>The reaction online has been predictably negative.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Peters notes that there <em>are</em> guardrails present in Project Genie, and he wasn't able to rip off any old video game.</p>
<p>"Project Genie wouldn’t generate a world that I prompted with the scenario of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kingdom_hearts_-_hd_1_5_plus_2_5_remix_-_cloud_version">Kingdom Hearts</a>," he explains. "When I removed the specific names of characters and wrote descriptions of them instead, Project Genie generated a thumbnail preview of the world featuring characters that were dead ringers for Sora (the series’ protagonist), Donald, Goofy, Jack Skellington, and Cloud. But when I tried to generate the actual experience, Project Genie blocked me."</p>
<p>He therefore quizzed Google on why the tool was perfectly happy to plagiarise Nintendo's IP without permission but not Disney's, and was told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides. As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peters adds that he was told that the tool is “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web,” which is almost certainly behind one of the big surprises in his Zelda video, as he explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This probably partially explains why Link deployed his paraglider in my test, which surprised me. At a high level, the Genie model is constantly trying to predict the next frame, and I’m sure there are <em>many</em> videos of people jumping in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and then gliding forward, which the model probably learned from."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Peters also notes that "shortly before publishing this article, Project Genie stopped letting me generate worlds based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> due to “interests of third-party content providers."</p>
<p>Perhaps Nintendo's legal team is already in touch, but it's nonetheless amazing that a company like Google is prepared to risk a battle of that stature when it launches new products like Project Genie.</p>

<figure data-uuid="046aaf27c8ac8"><a title="Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/046aaf27c8ac8/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, the day is finally upon us. Today is the last day that you can buy Switch Game Vouchers before Nintendo consigns them to the 'Discontinued' pile.</p>
<p>The Big N initially made the announcement way back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">July 2025</a>, but time has flown by since then, so we thought it was only right to give you one last nudge now that the day of reckoning is upon us.</p>
<p>You have until <strong>11:59pm</strong> in your timezone to make any final purchases, and the vouchers will be valid for one year from the point you buy them — so any that you pick up today won't expire until 30th January 2027. As ever, you'll need an active Nintendo Switch Online membership to get the vouchers in the first place.</p>
<p>For those who have missed out on this offer until today, Switch Game Vouchers come in pairs and can be used on select first-party digital purchases — saving you a few quid in the process. A pair of vouchers costs £84 / $99.98, which, when used on two full-price Switch 1 releases, knocks £16 / $20 off the combined price. It's a pretty sweet deal, we must admit.</p>
<p>While Game Vouchers cannot be used on Switch 2 exclusives, Nintendo has confirmed that it will continue to add Switch 1 releases to the scheme throughout 2026. Just yesterday, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> is a part of the Voucher programme and new releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> are available in it too (both of which have a paid upgrade option to Switch 2, if you choose to do that down the line).</p>
<p>You can find the full list of eligible games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0" rel="noopener">Nintendo's website</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make the most of this offer before it's gone, either head over to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo website</a> and sign in with your active NSO account, or head to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' section of the eShop on your Switch / Switch 2 and select 'Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers'. Do keep in mind that you can't have more than eight active Vouchers on your account at once, so don't go crazy out there!</p>
<p>So long, partner!</p>
