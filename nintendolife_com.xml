<p>Big(goron) envy</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It's been a cracking start to the year for Nintendo-themed LEGO sets, and one of the builds we're the most excited about is the upcoming 'Final Battle' diorama, inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>'s grand finale.</p>
<p>The set itself launches on <strong>1st March 2026</strong> for <strong>£99.99 / $129.99</strong>, packing in three Minifigures for Link, Zelda and Ganondorf, plus a big 'mech' build for ol' boar-form Ganon. Naturally, there are a handful of little easter eggs sprinkled in for fans as well, like a tiny Navi that accompanies Link in his airborne pose, and a hidden Megaton Hammer in the ruins of Ganondorf's Castle.</p>
<p>Before it hits store shelves, however, LEGO reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has gone hands-on with the set and provided a five-minute deep dive into its intricacies to give us our best look at it yet. The video provides a closer look at the stunning Zelda and Ganon Minifigs (the Link remains the same from the Deku Tree set), and the big Ganondorf build.</p>
<p>It also lets us get up close and personal with the diorama design itself, showcasing the castle backdrop without any of the characters in it, and the secret 'trapdoor' hatch from which Ganondorf can spring out for a surprise attack.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather neat — and not as pricey as we'd expect, after seeing the Deku Tree and recently-revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lego-pokemon-reveals-first-sets-launches-february-2026">Pokémon sets</a>. Gosh, we're going to have to clear some shelf space, aren't we?</p>

<p>Genre fusion</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Arc System Works' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/damon_and_baby">DAMON and BABY</a> didn't particularly grab our attention when it was teased back in the busy release schedule of last November, but the game's new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/damon-and-baby-switch/">eShop page</a> — and accompanying <strong>25th March</strong> launch date — encouraged us to take a closer look. And it's got to be said, there's some funky mechanical fusion going on in here.</p>
<p>DAMON and BABY is part action/adventure game, filled with puzzles and platforming, and part twin-stick shooter, filled with... well, twin-stick shooting. It's not a combination that we hear about all that often, so we respect how much this game appears to be flitting between the two.</p>
<p>Take the above trailer as an example. One second, we're looking at moving platforms and colour-changing wall tiles, the next, the dulcet tones of the narrator are running us through the weapon upgrade system and the huge arsenal that the titular demon king has at his disposal. Weird, right?</p>
<p>It gets weirder, fear not. The story follows said demon king, Damon, who forms an unlikely alliance with a human baby to break a curse that binds them together. Plot details are still pretty slim, but we <em>do</em> know that there's a local co-op option that lets P2 play as Damon's adorable little pooch — <em>win!</em></p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Arc System Works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>■A NEW TAKE ON SHOOTING ACTION AND IN-DEPTH EXPLORATION<br>
Experience a new type of action adventure, featuring a fusion between exploration within an expansive world and highly technical twin-stick shooting. At your home base, power up the demon king Damon and make purchases. During the exploration phase, defeat enemies to complete each area. The story progresses as you alternate between the two phases.</p>
<p>■STRATEGIC BATTLES WITH A VAST ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND GIMMICKS<br>
The battle mechanics include both close-ranged attacks with handguns as well as long-ranged attacks with machine guns and more.<br>
You can find more powerful weapons as you explore.<br>
During the boss battles awaiting within each stage, a strategic approach making use of the area gimmicks will prove crucial.</p>
<p>■CUSTOMIZATION AND OUTFIT CHANGES<br>
Damon grows throughout the adventure, learning to master various weapons and skills. You can customize your set of skills to match your play style. You can even choose from a variety of outfit options to change Damon's appearance.</p>
<p>■JOURNEY TOGETHER WITH TWO PLAYER CO-OP<br>
Take control of Damon's canine companion to help him in combat in various ways, such as collecting items.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the EU eShop listing is yet to materialise, the NA page suggests that we can expect to see this one towards the end of March with a <strong>$19.99</strong> price tag attached.</p>

<p>Following Three Kingdoms</p>

<p>To kick off the new year, Arc System Works has announced it will be releasing a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/river_city_saga_three_kingdoms">River City Saga</a> game.</p>
<p>It's currently being referred to as <strong>River City Saga: Journey to the West</strong>, but the official English title hasn't been revealed just yet. It will be coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms at some point in 2026 and according to a rough translation is described as an "absurd and thrilling comedy action game".</p>
<p>Here's the rest of the PR description (via Gematsu), and above is the first official artwork for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, Sanzang!? All of the main cast are <em>Kunio</em>-style characters! This is an absurd and thrilling comedy action game where everyone sets out to reach India! Following <em>River City Saga: Three Kingdoms</em>, <em>River City Saga: Journey to the West</em> is a new title themed after the Chinese myth <em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>
<p>"In the turbulent era of the Tang dynasty, monsters run rampant, and there is no hope for salvation. Saddened by the state of the world, Sakyamuni seeks to save it through the teachings of Buddha. And so he establishes the “Journey to Obtain the Scriptures,” sending them on a journey to the far western land of India to retrieve the Buddhist scriptures. The skilled Sun Wukong becomes a disciple of Sanzang and, in order to atone for his past sins, sets out on the journey to obtain the scriptures while protecting his master. The cheerful and easily carried-away Zhu Bajie and the earnest monk Sha Wujing also join as disciples, and the Sanzang party continues its journey west once again. The road to India stretches 108,000 miles. What kind of journey awaits them now…?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title is currently playable at the Taipei Game Show, and although gameplay hasn't been officially shared just yet, you can catch an incredibly brief glimpse via <a href="https://youtu.be/V8vonn3ShWc?t=611">a YouTube upload</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1421921698a16"><a title="Mighty No. 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1421921698a16/mighty-no-9.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>The video game company Comcept, originally founded by Keiji Inafune in December 2010, has been "officially dissolved by a shareholders' resolution" earlier this month on 13th January 2026.</p>
<p>A notice was published about this today in Japan's government gazette Kanpo (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/comcept-shuts-down">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>If you're a tad confused based on previous reports and updates, Gematsu's creator and editor Sal Romano has provided a bit more context about what exactly has taken place here (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/comcept-shuts-down.1419268/page-2#post-150647608">via ResetEra</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LEVEL-5 never actually acquired Comcept. Early reports of the LEVEL5 comcept establishment came from Japanese blogs reporting on it from Weekly Famitsu, and mentioned comcept becoming a subsidiary of LEVEL-5, but this was actually a misunderstanding.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132opktrm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The official announcement later posted here --- <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/</a> --- only mentions that a new company called LEVEL5 comcept was established, and that it is a fully owned subsidiary of LEVEL-5. It still refers to Inafune is comcept's CEO, as well as a co-CEO of LEVEL5 comcept with Akihiro Hino. It even mentions that titles currently in development by comcept at the time would continue to be managed by comcept (and not LEVEL5 comcept).</p>
<p>It's mentioned in the article, but LEVEL5 comcept was already dissolved and taken over by the newer LEVEL-5 Osaka Office following Inafune's departure from LEVEL-5 in mid-2024. This is the studio that made FANTASY LIFE i.</p>
<p>However, comcept as a separate company still existed. Until now that is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comcept made headlines over the years for its troubled release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mighty_no_9">Mighty No. 9</a>, which originally started life as a Kickstarter project. Before founding his studio and his eventual "departure from Level-5 in mid-2024", Inafune worked at Capcom on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamegear/mega_man">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha</a> and multiple other well-known video game series.</p>
<p>Apart from Mighty No. 9, the studio helped out with games such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/soul_sacrifice">Soul Sacrifice</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/recore">ReCore</a>. As for Level-5's Osaka office, it most recently worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>.</p>

<header><section>
<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> speeds onto the Switch 2 this week, and it just might be the best-looking game to date on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/grid-legends-on-switch-2-an-excellent-racer-stacked-with-graphics-options">Digital Foundry has now taken a look</a>, and here's exactly what you can expect when it comes to the game's performance and resolution across the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The docked graphics mode runs between 1080p and 1440p at 30fps, and docked performance mode is 792p to 1080p and maintains a smooth 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the handheld experience, GRID Legends has four options on the Switch 2. This includes performance, battery saver, balanced and graphics modes. In graphics mode, the game runs between 792p and 1080p at 30fps, and in performance it's 684p to 828p at 60fps. The battery saver and balanced modes result in lower resolution and frame rates of 30fps and 40fps.</p>
<p>So, what's the best way to play? Here's Digital Foundry's recommendations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the docked experience, we're going to have to give the nod to the 30fps graphics mode simply because so much of the visual experience is stripped back to give you that 60fps alternative that the game loses a lot of its graphical appeal - and we have to wonder why the option for a 40fps balanced mode that traded some resolution for features didn't make its way into the shipping game. For mobile gaming, it's perhaps no surprise that we've opted for that 40fps alternative: resolution is OK, a 25ms per-frame refresh still looks good on the VRR panel and while you don't get volumetric lights, the return of screen-space reflections is worth it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, PJ O'Reilly recommended the "smooth performance" option and was still blown away by how great it looked on the big screen. He was also impressed with the range of graphics options and just how "solid" they were across both the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>If you want to find out even more details about the Switch 2 version's graphics, performance, added extras and how it compares to other platforms, check out Digital Foundry's video review above and its website for a more comprehensive breakdown.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo released a major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> this week, and in case you missed it, it adds health bars to the game.</p>
<p>This has come as a real surprise to Splatoon players, as up until now, the enemy's health in multiplayer was displayed through visual cues. As Nintendo notes, the remaining health of opponents will now be shown above their heads for "a few seconds" when they're visible. Certain abilities can also make this bar visible.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description about the implementation of health bars in multiplayer:</p>

<p>"With version 11.0.0, it’s now possible to see an opponent’s remaining health when they’ve been hit. Previously, you could only see how damaged an enemy was by looking closely at how much ink they were covered in – not so easy to do in the heat of battle!</p>
<p>"Now, their remaining health will be shown in a bar above their head for a few seconds, provided they’ve not ducked behind cover or dived into their ink. Though if the opponent is visible via abilities such as Thermal Ink or has been marked by things like a Point Sensor or Wave Breaker you’ll be able to see it even then!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned by Nintendo, it's not always the easiest to see "how damaged an enemy" is in the heat of the battle, so this update will no doubt help, even if it arguably removes some of the uniqueness and charm of the team-based squid-shooter.</p>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how you can now also see the health bars of your teammates when they've taken damage, which may allow you to save them before they're wiped out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll also be able to see the health bars of your teammates if they’ve taken damage. Keeping an eye on these health bars is a great way to support your allies or chase down weakened foes – even if you’ve teamed up with Inklings and Octolings you’re not familiar with."</p>

<p>Apart from these updates, Nintendo has also highlighted some other notable updates, including a new state known as "Flow Aura", updates to the game's hit detection, and stealth jump.
