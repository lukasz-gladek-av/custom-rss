<p>Last week, we heard how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> had become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-now-the-best-selling-physical-game-in-the-us-this-year">"best-selling" physical game in the US</a> of the year.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, Circana's video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has shared official chart data for this same location, confirming the new entry in the long-running series was the best-selling game on Nintendo platforms in October 2025. This does not factor in the digital sales of the title.</p>
<p>It replaced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> in the top spot, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remains in third place.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59qvhsok&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mat Piscatella:</strong> "Pokémon Legends: Z-A ranked 2nd overall during October and was the month’s best-selling game on Nintendo platforms. It launched as 2025’s best-selling physical game year-to-date."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="508a4af33a022"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/508a4af33a022/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Circana, LLC</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by Piscatella, Pokémon Legends: Z-A placed second behind EA's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> (which also made its debut last month) in the "best-selling games" for the US in October 2025.</p>
<p>Once again, this doesn't include the digital sales for Pokémon. Further down this list was Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 in 13th place (one rank higher than the previous month).</p>
<figure data-uuid="ca9ef96b2f9d1"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca9ef96b2f9d1/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Circana, LLC</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Piscatella has also shared some details about Nintendo Switch 2 sales growth in this location during October 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Video game hardware spending in October grew 36% when compared a year ago, to $351M. Switch 2 was again able to offset declines across Switch (-52% versus a year ago... Nintendo Switch 2 sold 328k units in October. It is 68% ahead of the sales pace set by the original Nintendo Switch and is 3% ahead of PlayStation 4’s previous record velocity."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is considered one of the standout video games of 2025, and the Switch 2 exclusive has now been officially recognised at the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards as the recipient of the Critics' Choice Award.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza was also up for 'Ultimate Game Of The Year' and 'Console Game of the Year' at the same event (voting for these categories was open to the public). <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> took out the ultimate award, and Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> won the console category. The PlayStation exclusive also beat <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in the same category.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4yuitok&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The Switch 2 and Switch 2 Pro Controller had also been shortlisted for "Best Gaming Hardware". This award went to AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> took out the "still playing" mobile award, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> won best self-published indie game.</p>

<p>In our review of Donkey Kong Bananza here on Nintendo Life, we awarded this title an "excellent" nine out of ten stars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whether it's smashing through the scenery with a Bananza Transformation or carefully planning a route to a hidden Banandium Gem, you'll have trouble finding more originality and, crucially, more enjoyment from a platformer in recent years. As the DK Rap so wisely said, "Donkey Kong is here." Now let's just hope he stays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some <em>other</em> award show news, earlier this week it was announced Donkey Kong Bananza was in the running for The Game Awards' Game of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it faces some tough competition, including games such as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (which is up for 12 awards at the same show), Hollow Knight: Silksong and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>

<p>This marks the beginning of "regularly scheduled in-game events" for Kirby Air Riders, which may or may not remind you of the limited-time events in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. During these events, participants will be able to earn rewards such as "street names, stickers, and themes" to customise their license.</p>
<p>These events are currently planned to run for "a year after launch", so get ready for many more in the future! You'll be able to access them from the main menu of Kirby Air Riders, which you can see in the screenshot below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adxmtnyu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
