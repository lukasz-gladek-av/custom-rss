<p>I was wearing my <em>“It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.”</em> shirt while running a quick errand at the bank. The teller spotted it. He was at least 20 years younger than me, but his “Nice shirt!” comment kicked off a lengthy conversation about our shared Nintendo fandom.</p>
<p>Before long, he pulled out a tablet and showed me <a href="https://grantgm.com/">his digital fan art</a>. It was awesome: detailed, dynamic sketches of Mario, Pokémon, and (my favourite) Metroid characters. His passion was apparent.</p>
<p>I told him I was thrilled by his drawings, because I know how much that work means. You see, years ago, I had a job at Nintendo that involved seeing hundreds of pieces of original Nintendo fan art. And I took some home.</p>
<p>This is the story of that collection, and how a handful of drawings, once marked for the landfill, became some of the most meaningful pieces of my gaming collection.</p>

<h2><strong>Player’s Pulse and a Pile of Precious Paper</strong></h2>
<p>This will definitely date me, but I interned at Nintendo during the second half of 1996. Before long, I was given complete control of Player’s Pulse, the letters to the editor section. I chose fan letters, wrote responses, and, most importantly, picked the envelope art that was displayed on those pages.</p>
<p>Mind you, this was nearly three decades ago, so the letters and the artwork were on real, physical paper, sent via snail mail. This was before the days of email and file shares.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved sifting through the envelope art because it was pure fandom: earnest, expressive, and often beautiful.</p>
<p>I was shocked to learn that it was Nintendo's practice to destroy all artwork after it had been screened and scanned for the magazine! That meant dozens, maybe hundreds, of amateur art pieces in the trash bin each month.</p>
<p>It felt criminal to toss that effort, so I kept all the artwork that came across my desk during my short internship.</p>
<p>Here are five pieces of art that define the long journey of that collection:</p>
<h2><strong>Naomi Chiba’s Envelopes</strong></h2>
<p>Years after I left Nintendo Power, I read a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-power-helped-a-shy-fan-show-her-art-to-the-wor-1786871046">Kotaku article</a> about <strong>Naomi Chiba</strong>, easily the most prolific Player’s Pulse artist ever. While reading, I remembered that I had three of her original envelopes in my collection!</p>
<figure data-uuid="097d8e4038545"><a title="Two published and one unpublished art piece by Naomi Chiba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/097d8e4038545/two-published-and-one-unpublished-art-piece-by-naomi-chiba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Naomi Chiba</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With help from the author, I connected with Naomi and arranged to return her artwork.</p>
<p>Doing so was surprisingly emotional. I hesitated when it came time to seal the envelope, but then it occurred to me that she might be the first person to ever get back the artwork that they had sent to Nintendo Power.</p>
<p>That’s when it hit me: this coloured paper meant something.</p>
<h2><strong>Quid pro Quo with Seth</strong></h2>
<p>The success with Naomi led me to find more artists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hatlandous/">Seth Hatland</a> came next. He was so grateful to get his <strong>Mega Man X</strong> and <strong>Mario</strong> drawings back that he insisted on trading them for a brand-new piece of art as a thank you. “I’ve gotten slightly better,” he said.</p>
<p>What an understatement!</p>
<p>He sent me an incredible piece of Link that has hung proudly in my office ever since.</p>

<h2><strong>The Big Trade</strong></h2>
<p>After returning art to several more creators, I was connected with Stephan Reese (aka <a href="https://x.com/ArtofNP">ArtofNP</a>) and his non-profit <a href="https://www.interactiveartcollection.org/">Interactive Art Collection</a>. They specialise in original Nintendo Power artwork, although he hadn’t seen much in the way of envelope art - probably because Nintendo had destroyed it all.</p>
<p>I ultimately agreed to add most of my remaining collection to his museum.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2682f716b2d85"><a title="Envelope art from Nintendo Power" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2682f716b2d85/envelope-art-from-nintendo-power.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In return, Stephan sent me an original, professional piece made for the promotional brochure of the Nintendo Super System arcade, circa 1992. I love it almost as much as the amateur stuff, plus I’m happy to know that the rest of the fan art is in a better place than a binder on my shelf.</p>
<figure data-uuid="00245d417ff8f"><a title="Original art for the Nintendo Super System arcade brochure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00245d417ff8f/original-art-for-the-nintendo-super-system-arcade-brochure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>(I'm the "ex-Nintendo employee" mentioned in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-art-of-nintendo-power-exhibit-a-guided-tour">Nintendo Life post</a> about Stephan’s exhibit a couple of years ago.)</p>

<h2><strong>The One I Kept</strong></h2>
<p>After all that wheeling and dealing, I was left with one volume's worth of envelopes, which hangs in my game room. Here’s Volume 92 in all its glory:</p>
<figure data-uuid="c6f322714c9cb"><a title="Framed fan-art from Nintendo Power Volume 92" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6f322714c9cb/framed-fan-art-from-nintendo-power-volume-92.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Family Fan Art</strong></h2>
<p>The most recent additions to my art collection are courtesy of my own kids. Is there anything better than a child’s imagination and fandom put to paper?</p>
<p>My oldest is studying art at Utah State University, but her early work continues to remind me that fan art isn't just a fun hobby; sometimes it’s a training ground.</p>

<hr>
<p>When I look at my art collection, I don’t see discarded mail. I see a bond between the creatives at a massive entertainment company and their fans.</p>
<p>My new bank teller friend, with his portfolio of beautiful, detailed digital sketches, is part of a timeless, vital tradition. He's doing what fans, including my own daughter, have done for decades: translating their hobby into a personal act of creation.</p>
<p>I may have initially 'stolen' art from Nintendo, but in the end, that art taught me a lesson: the true heart of a gaming community isn't some corporate office. It's the enduring, incredible passion of its talented fans.</p>

Well, either way, it's the weekend, so let's do a quick recap of the week before we dive into what we're playing, shall we?</p>
<p>Naturally, the biggest news of the week was the announcement from Nintendo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> would be making a comeback, with both a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update">free update planned for all owners alongside a paid Switch 2 Edition</a> in the new year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> is also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-today-with-a-spooky-classic">now available on the Switch</a> via an NSO + Expansion Pack subscription, so hopefully a few of you have been playing this one for Halloween.</p>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">a bunch of announcements</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> revealed that a special Pro Controller will be launching alongside the game, with a Grace Ashcroft amiibo following in Summer 2026. Neat!</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer<br></h2>
<p>I recently picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, and it really is delightful. The performance issues on Switch 2 are definitely apparent, but it's really got its hooks in me. I find myself constantly tweaking little bits of my museum, taking "just one more" expedition to nab another fossil or skeleton for my collection, and simply sitting back to admire my handy work. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>I'd like to play some more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, but I'm tempted to put it aside for a little bit until the online issues are resolved.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have friends staying over this weekend, so I expect a fair amount of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and probably a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> — what can I say? I’m a sucker for a few holes of Golf!</p>
<p>All this does mean that the final Mission or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> will probably have to take a back seat for a couple of days. I’ll finish it soon, I promise!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'll be splitting my time between doing some review stuff and insulating my loft this weekend. Honestly, I wish I was joking. So, not much time for gaming, really, but I definitely will still be chilling with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> at some point, as I've got to get back to that before I forget the story.</p>
<p>Other than this, it'll be quick blasts of BALL x PIT (unbelievably addictive, be warned) and I'm afraid I've gone and bough the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, so hopefully the online issues Ollie <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">pointed out in his review</a> will get sorted down the line. I'm still more than happy to have it portable, to be honest, as online isn't my preferred way to play the old fighting games. Too much stress, mate.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_formation">Final Formation</a> has no right to be this good. Jaleco’s original outing was a staple in Famiclones back in the day and it remains a stellar unlicensed Macross tribute, but this new remake dials everything up to eleven. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> front, Prometheus is being a royal pain on my way to the summit of Mount Olympus. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a> is proving to be good fun and I got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> back into rotation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 45 of 50 games played. What better game to spend Halloween than Night Manor! But Pilot Quest, Elfazar’s Hat and Lords of Diskonia are all top shelf stuff. Only five games to discover!</p>
<p>Game of the week is naturally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>. We must be doing something right because as of right now we have the original trilogy in glorious HD-2D. Now, if only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> HD-2D becomes real...</p>

<p>Nintendo of Canada has also issued an announcement, mentioning how playable demos are now available at select Best Buy locations. The full game will once again arrive next week on <strong>6th November 2025</strong> and will see you battle hordes of enemies in the untold story of the Imprisoning War.</p>
