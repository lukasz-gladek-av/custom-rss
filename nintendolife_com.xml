<p>Fallout 4 arrives on Switch 2 this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="0c85c603070bc"><a title="Fallout 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c85c603070bc/fallout-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is on its way to the Switch 2 this year, and it might not be the only Fallout game returning in the future. This information comes from the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">same Windows Central report</a> about "what to expect" from Xbox "this year, and beyond".</p>
<p>According to the site's executive editor Jez Corden, Fallout fans can "eventually" expect to see a "<strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_3">Fallout 3</a></strong> remake in the vein of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>", with <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/fallout_new_vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> to also apparently receive the same treatment.</p>
<p>A separate story on Windows Central provides a little more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nothing else is known about these Fallout remasters beyond the fact that they exist and are planned, though the news that they'll be similar to Oblivion Remastered suggests they may be designed in the same way. This would mean the use of Unreal Engine 5 for an extensive graphical overhaul, with Bethesda's Creation Engine predecessor Gamebryo still serving as the core of the gameplay systems."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/starcraft-wolfenstein-3-and-fallout-new-vegas-remake-could-all-be-in-the-works-over-at-xbox">colleagues at Pure Xbox note</a>, this isn't the first time fans have heard about the possibility of these older entries in the series returning, and late last year, company legend Todd Howard said Bethesda was <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/bethesda-boss-hints-at-fallout-remasters-says-the-team-is-working-on-a-bunch-of-stuff">working on a "whole bunch of stuff"</a> for the series.</p>
<p>Of course, as nothing has been officially announced or confirmed yet, there are no details about the platforms these games would target. However, Microsoft is now releasing more games on other devices than ever before, and this includes releases for Nintendo's platforms.</p>
<p>Bethesda has also shown its support for Nintendo's Switch 2 in recent times with not only the announcement of Fallout 4, but also the news <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is coming to the new hybrid system this year. Over the holiday period it also released a Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>.</p>

<p>This information comes from the game's director Kazutoyo Maehiro in a press release (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-one-million">shared via Gematsu</a>):</p>

<p>One aim, as noted, would be to make the tactical RPG more accessible to a "wider audience". Specifics about how the development team would make the game "more enjoyable" (or content that might be added) weren't revealed, but again, these updates are still just being considered.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles was released in September 2025 on Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms.</p>

<p>Decision apparently unrelated to recent unionisation</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="e7be31c8b9303"><a title="Ubisoft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7be31c8b9303/ubisoft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft has started its new year with the closure of its Canada-based studio Ubisoft Halifax. According to a company spokesperson, more than 70 positions are impacted as part of cost-cutting and restructuring measures.</p>
<p>Staff were informed about the closure on Wednesday. Here's the official comment (via VGC):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0ewunkyh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>“71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The studio was mostly focused on mobile development, but also assisted other Ubisoft teams and had worked on major Ubisoft IP including <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tom_clancys_rainbow_six_siege">Rainbow Six</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed</a>.</p>
<p>This closure has taken place a month after about 60 workers at Ubisoft Halifax formed a union, signing up to the "Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada". Ubisoft says the decision to close the studio was made "well before" this, and respects rights of employees to unionise.</p>
<p>The union has also issued a response saying it will "pursue every legal recourse" to defend union members impacted by the closure.</p>
<p>In the past year, Ubisoft opened a new subsidiary backed by Tencent to focus on Assassin's Creed and other IP. It's been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-kicks-off-raymans-30th-anniversary-says-new-project-is-in-good-hands">celebrating the 30th anniversary of <strong>Rayman</strong></a>, and also launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on Switch 2 in December last year. Although this version didn't get off to the best start, updates have now been rolled out to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-shadows-update-to-resolve-switch-2-crashes-and-stability-issues">resolve crashes and stability issues</a>.</p>
