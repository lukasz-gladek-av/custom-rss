<figure><a title="Minecraft Super Mario and Animal Crossing: New Horizons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0e0873c6eb70/minecraft-super-mario-and-animal-crossing-new-horizons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new survey conducted by Japanese variety show <strong>Ariyoshiiieeeee! – Oh yeah! Wanna play games at your place now?</strong> has <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">revealed Japan's favourite video games</a>, both overall and by age rating, and while the likes of Mario, Splatoon, Pokémon, Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest all make frequent appearances, none of them made the top spot. (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>!)</p>
<p>Nope, Japan's number one game — at least, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by the show — is none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> landed at second overall, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> came in third. Everyone surveyed was asked to give their five favourite games, and then votes were tallied up to bring us the results.</p>
<p>Now, the above shouldn't be too surprising, as Minecraft is absolutely <em>massive</em> worldwide, and the hosts of the show make a very good point — Minecraft is not just a game, but a platform." And nowadays, as the announcer says, "it's become very normal for young people to experience games not just for the gameplay, but as a means of communication."</p>
<p>The top 100 includes <em>many</em> Nintendo, <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, and <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> games, but here are a few stats that stood out to us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> takes the overall number 5 spot, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> at 18. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl">Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl</a> is the highest-ranked Pokémon game at 14, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> is right behind it. No Final Fantasy game makes the top ten, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> is the closest at 16th (with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_x_x-2_hd_remaster">X</a> right on its tail).</p>
<p>Other interesting games making an appearance include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yo-kai_watch_2_bony_spirits_and_fleshy_souls">Yo-kai Watch 2</a> at 25, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> at 46, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at 60, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/xevious">Xevious</a> at 93. Xevious!</p>
<p>Here's the overall top 10 — for the rest of the results, check out <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minecraft</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fortnite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 2</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Breaking things down by age group, the show split these into five categories — gamers in their teens (10-19), 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.</p>
<p>For teens, Minecraft is unequivocally the number one game, with Fortnite and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> rounding out the top three. Mojang's mammoth game also makes it into the top ten games for those in their 20s at number 8, where Diamond &amp; Pearl sits up top ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Ultimate</a> and New Horizons.</p>
<p>For those of us in our 30s (like this author), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Green</a> is number one, with Final Fantasy X and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold &amp; Silver</a> right behind it. Not surprised at the early-gen Pokémon love here. For the 40s and 50s crowd, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_iii">Dragon Quest III</a> and Super Mario Bros. are the one-two here (flipped for the older gamers), with another Dragon Quest game right behind them — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_v_hand_of_the_heavenly_bride">V</a> for the 40-year-olds, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">the original NES game</a> for the 50s.</p>
<p>We're not massively surprised at any of these results, but it's an interesting look at how trends in video games have shifted over time — and what people value in video games. And while the vast majority of games are from Japan, there are lots of Western titles making a dent in people's hearts — and consoles. You can watch the <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">episode right here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's only a small sample of people (3,000 isn't many!), but it's still an interesting capsule of consumer interests, and it pairs nicely with Nikkei's own survey, which shows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/gender-split-and-average-ages-of-japanese-nintendo-players-revealed-via-new-survey">gender splits and average ages for fans of particular series</a>.</p>

<p>Risk it all in August</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>WayForward has given us a Switch release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>, the once-cancelled GBA sequel to the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/shantae">Shantae</a> game.</p>
<p>Coming to Switch on <strong>19th August 2025</strong> — a few months after some fans got hold of a GBA cartridge with the game on it from Limited Run Games — Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is also getting a Deluxe Edition, which comes with three extra costumes for the genie to dress up in.</p>
<p>These three exclusive costumes are the Relic Hunter, High Voltage, and Sizzle Armor, each giving Shantae unique powers. If you're getting the physical version of the game, the Deluxe Edition is already included on the cartridge. Pre-orders go live on 8th August 2025 at <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/shantae-advance-risky-revolution-standard-edition-switch-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc?_pos=5&amp;_sid=1f19ab402&amp;_ss=r">Limited Run Games</a>, where the game costs $34.99.</p>

<p>Let's get a quick rundown of the game from developer WayForward, then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shantae is back in an adventure 20 years in the making! The nefarious pirate Risky Boots has a “groundbreaking” new plan that will leave Sequin Land spinning — by rotating the continent, she can move any town right to the coast for easy plundering! As Shantae, turn the tectonic tables on Risky by taking control of the land itself: shift, twist, navigate, and explore by swapping between mix-and-match multilayered levels! Hair-whip and belly-dance your way through scrambled lands, misplaced towns, monster-filled crypts, and daunting labyrinths. Six creature transformations, fierce boss battles, and a 4-player versus mode await!</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br>
-</strong> Discover the lost chapter of the Shantae saga, fully restored and released after 20 years!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Fight and explore using your hair-whipping ability, magic items, and belly-dance transformations (including monkey, elephant, crab, and more)!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Spin and shift Front Yard and Back Yard playfields to create new routes and solve puzzles!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Visit towns, battle through labyrinths, purchase upgrades, find collectables, and meet with friends like Rottytops, Sky, and Bolo!<br>
<strong>-</strong> For the first time ever in a Shantae game, four players can compete in Battle Mode!</p>

<figure><a title="Date Everything" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6454690e91558/date-everything.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team17</em></figcaption></figure><p>We had a lot of respect for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/date_everything">Date Everything</a> when it arrived on Switch earlier this year. This bonkers dating sim boasted a monster voice cast with portfolios spanning <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Persona</strong>, <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and more, but it was let down by some heartbreaking performance issues. Fortunately, the latest Switch update — which developer Sassy Chap Games calls a "mega patch" — should clear some of that up.</p>
<p>The latest update bundles three previous hotfixes into one bug break-up package. Those bugs have clearly been the target of this one, with the "mega patch" fixing a lot of issues in the game's multiple endings, and adding an overall performance boost to the Switch version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-veteran-says-nintendo-was-the-only-one-making-steady-revenue-from-nes-game-carts-capcoms-profits-really-took-off-with-the-ps1/">Automaton Media</a>, Okamoto detailed that it was harder for third-party developers such as Capcom and retailers to actually turn a profit making and selling games for the Famicom. And, from his experience, "only Nintendo had a guaranteed profit."</p>
<p>"Let’s say a Famicom cartridge sold for 10,000 yen at retail. Out of that, 3,000 yen went to the retailer. 4,000 yen went to the software developer, like Capcom, and 3,000 yen went to Nintendo," which sounds okay at first glance, but Okamoto clarifies that "Out of Nintendo’s 3,000 yen share, about 1,500 went to manufacturing contractors."</p>
<p>"Since Nintendo got paid upfront for the exact number of copies, manufactured the cartridges, and delivered them, what happened after that didn’t matter to them." Back in the '80s, Capcom was a relatively new developer, and had to pay around 3,000 yen per unit upfront.</p>

<p>This resulted in the company taking out bank loans to ensure it could afford to pay the Big N, but this built up over time, as it apparently took Nintendo up to 3 months to supply cartridges. Then, Capcom had to send those cartridges and invoices to distributors, but it would rarely get paid immediately, instead receiving a promissory notice to say the money would be coming in 3 months.</p>
<p>That meant, often, that any profit would take up to 6 months to reach Capcom, which would likely be spent on clearing those bank loans. Okamoto also talks about unsold cartridge stock, where developers would often have leftovers thanks to having to over-order, as production took around 3 months. That adds another 3,000 yen unit to costs.</p>
<p>Okamoto still stresses that the NES and SNES were worth it for Capcom, despite cartridges "really only" benefitting Nintendo — and you only have to look at Street Fighter II sales figures to see that.</p>
<p>So, while cartridge-based systems, costs were higher — and that's still true today, from what we know — so when the PlayStation was announced, and disc manufacturing costs were cheaper, it was a dream for third-parties.</p>

<p>“Capcom’s profits skyrocketed with the switch from cartridges to discs,” Okamoto tells viewers, stating that not only were manufacturing costs cheaper, but that Sony would also return its share of the pay (1,600 yen of the 1,800 paid, for example) if Capcom returned any unsold CDs.</p>
<p>Faster restocking speeds, allowing devs to respond much quicker to sale spikes and interests, meant that Capcom was able to thrive even more in the disc-based era. But Nintendo was still a huge part of its success because it allowed them to grow their player base <em>and</em> get a foot in the door in the console gaming space.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating look at how video game development worked back in the late '80s and early '90s, and yet another look at why the PS1 did as well as it did. Who knows how different things would be with that Sony disc add-on for the SNES...</p>
