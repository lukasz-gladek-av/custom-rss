<p>Difficulty levels and better checkpoints in the works</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> is a pretty good game; we should know, we gave it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">7/10 in our review</a>. But many folks have, understandably, criticised it for its often punishing difficulty and stingy checkpoint system.</p>
<p>So, to address this, Bandai Namco has announced update 1.1.0, an upcoming patch that looks to "redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy". It will focus primarily on three key areas: difficulty, movement when controlling PUCK, and the checkpoint system.</p>
<p>Here's what the full announcement entails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who played this game. Each and every one of your opinions is our greatest_asset and the driving force propelling us forward.<br>
<strong><br>
Reflections</strong></p>
<p>We developed Shadow Labyrinth aiming for a unique experience: “Wandering the labyrinth, devouring, and evolving.”</p>
<p>We sincerely acknowledge the many evaluations of the game we’ve received, along with the numerous opinions shared by our players.</p>
<p>Particularly:</p>
<p>- Inconvenience of saving / traveling<br>
- Mini-PUCK play control in MAZE sections<br>
- High difficulty</p>
<p>These were challenges felt by many players, and we strongly feel they are points the development team must sincerely address.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Version Update</strong></p>
<p>The upcoming version update is not merely a bug fix or adjustment. Its purpose is to redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy.</p>
<p>A flexible system allowing players to choose difficulty levels, and improved immersion through comfortable controls and appropriately placed checkpoints.</p>
<p>We will build the next update around those core elements. We hope you look forward to the updated version of Shadow Labyrinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we can't exactly say what "improved immersion through comfortable controls" means, the prospect of difficulty settings and more generous checkpoints will no doubt come as good news to fans.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep you up to date on when this new update is scheduled to drop on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
