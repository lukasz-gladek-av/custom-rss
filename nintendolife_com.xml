<p>Nintendo has announced it will be running another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-switch-online-playtest-program-returning-includes-switch-2-support">Switch Online Playtest Program later this month</a>, and in the fine print of the application guidelines and "how to apply" section, it once again asks participants to "not discuss or disclose content" about this test.</p>
<p>This request from Nintendo to not share content also extends to not revealing details from the participant website or talking about the experience with "others". One exception to this rule is if you participate "as a group" in the playtest, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it's "within the bounds of your group".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lugvkr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others. If you participate as a group, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it remains within the bounds of your group."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you might recall, the previous playtest immediately led to all sorts of leaks – with participants uploading details and videos about the experience, and also live streaming direct footage. According to previous reports, Nintendo responded to this at the time with copyright takedowns across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Although Nintendo was enforcing these rules in the previous test, oddly, it didn't even bother to disable in-game screenshots or the video recording feature on the Switch. This latest playtest is also bumping the participant count from 10,000 users to "as many as 40,000 participants worldwide" so the chance of a leak has just been drastically increased.</p>

According to the credits (via IGN), Kouji Takeda is Donkey Kong, and Pauline is voiced by Jenny Kidd.</p>
<p>Takeda is the voice of DK in the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie and was also listed in the credits of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. This follows reports of Takashi Nagasako (the voice of DK for over two decades) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/princess-peachs-voice-actor-has-been-replaced-after-18-years"><em>not</em> being credited</a> in last month's Switch 2 launch title.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vyntks&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As for Kidd, this actor and musician takes on the role of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/paulines-age-in-donkey-kong-bananza-has-been-revealed">younger 13-year-old version of Pauline</a>. This same character was voiced by Kate Higgins in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In some related news, last month it was confirmed Peach's voice actor had been replaced after an 18 year run. In recent years, Nintendo has also told fans to wait for the official game release to find out details like this. This has extended to developer reveals, although this was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">slightly different for DK's new outing</a>.</p>

We saw it with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> physical release, and DK's new release also has artwork on this side of the case.</p>
<p>It's an image of Donkey Kong and Pauline taking a break from their new adventure. You might have seen this artwork in some other promotional materials before now. Although there's no Switch 2 branding, you can still swap it to the front side of the case. Here's a look, courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/Jake_Randall_YT">YouTuber Jake Randall</a> on social media:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vyntks&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, if you haven't already got a physical version of Donkey Kong Bananza, or just don't plan on getting a hard copy of the game, this is what it looks like when you open the case! Nintendo also did <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/heres_a_first_look_inside_metroid_dreads_nintendo_switch_game_case">similar full spread shots like this</a> on some box arts during the Switch generation.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the DK physical release, the game card (which includes the <em>entire</em> game on the card) features the same artwork as Banaza's front cover featuring DK and Pauline. And the <a href="https://x.com/BoTalksGames/status/1943776059562070078">back of the case</a> shows off some more artwork of DK, while also highlighting some other aspects of the game.</p>
<p>All of this has got us wondering if our community has picked up this new Switch 2 release physically or if they purchased the game digitally via the eShop? <em>So, vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>To apply and participate, you'll need to have a Nintendo Account and an "active" Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is a test of the "same service" Nintendo performed a test for in October last year.</p>
<p>One other notable update is the ability to download this "exclusive software" on not only the original Switch system but also the Switch 2, which launched last month.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lugvkr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This test will be available to users located in the US, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Japan, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It will take place between <strong>28th July 2025</strong> until <strong>10th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Registrations open this week on <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>, and if you participated in the previous playtest, you can apply to participate individually or as a group for this latest test. Applicants will be accepted on a "first-come, first-served basis".</p>
<p>In the lead up to the original playtest last year, Nintendo told participants to not "discuss or disclose" anything about it. Of course, this led to details and footage of the game leaking online, with some users even streaming their experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-still-doesnt-want-you-to-talk-about-the-switch-online-playtest-program">same rules apply for the latest test</a>, and Nintendo also notes how this playtest is "expected to accept as many as 40,000 participants worldwide". This announcement follows the news earlier this week Nintendo would be hosting an online demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, due out next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157384/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</a> is the newest entry in Spike Chunsoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files">AI: Somnium Files</a> series and is actually a spin-off of the first two games. As a 'mid-quel' between both stories, No Sleep for Kaname Date is a good companion piece for fans of the series but not so much for those unfamiliar. Its visual novel elements are bolstered by new gameplay mechanics that keep the game, and series, from becoming stale.</p>
<p>This entry also sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date. This time around, his idol friend, Iris Sagan, is kidnapped by a UFO and she’s forced to play escape room games in order to stay alive, while Kaname works around the clock to uncover the dark secrets behind Iris’s abduction.</p>
<p>No Sleep for Kaname Date is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak_ii">Trails through Daybreak 2</a> of the series, as its story doesn’t move the overall series plot forward in a meaningful way, but focuses on a much more personal conflict. I’ve always loved the series’ incorporation of wacky conspiracy theories to its mysteries, but then it turns out that the truth is actually much more grounded.</p>
<figure><a title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157383/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I enjoyed the characters talking about how ancient civilisations received alien technology, I do think that No Sleep for Kaname Date has the weakest twists of the three games so far. They’re a little more predictable this time around and as a result don’t hit as hard.</p>
<p>By its very nature of being a spin-off, the story could leave some fans feeling alienated, but it reintroduces characters like the second game’s protagonist, Ryuki, to show players what he was doing before his prior big debut. The new characters Hina and Akemi are fantastic additions, as the former’s love for puzzles and the latter’s weird reptilian origins make the already weird cast even more enigmatic.</p>
<p>This makes No Sleep for Kaname Date an excellent bridge between both games. The game fully expects you to know who these characters are and how they fit into the overall Somnium Files universe, so it's best to go in once you’ve played the other two entries.</p>

<p>The previous games were written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who was also director of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape</a> series. However, this time around, No Sleep for Kaname Date is directed and written by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/it-was-hell-spike-chunsoft-devs-discuss-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">Kazuya Yamada</a>. Honestly, it’s hard to tell that this game was written by someone else entirely. Yamada did a great job emulating Uchikoshi’s writing style. Iris is just as bubbly as ever, and Date is as much of a perv as he was in the previous games. The characters’ personalities are consistent, which prevents No Sleep for Kaname Date from feeling jarring.</p>
<p>The main gameplay mechanic revolves around Psyncs, where Date can jump into the psyche of another person. Date will have to solve “mental locks” that are related to the current mystery. Here, his eyeball companion, Aiba, navigates throughout the dream-like world interacting with various objects. For example, if she comes across an important script, she might get the option to “take” or “read” it. Only one of them is the correct answer that’ll progress through the mental locks.</p>
<p>These puzzles have remained largely unchanged from previous games and end up devolving into guessing games. There’s really not much of a strategy except hope that you pick the right answer. It feels rather unengaging sometimes.</p>

<p>However, the new escape room puzzles are much more exciting and make up for the somewhat underwhelming Somniums. Ironically, the game where Uchikoshi is the least involved with borrows the mechanic he’s best known for. These escape rooms require you to really put your brain to the test. For example, in the first escape room, you have to look at patterns on torn flags to figure out a special code to put into a terminal, or else your room will run out of air.</p>
<p>The escape rooms feel intense when you’re on a timer, especially compared to the Somniums. It’s difficult to strike a balance when it comes to escape rooms, but they feel appropriately challenging here. I felt an immense sense of satisfaction when I solved them, and that they were never unfairly hard.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble during these segments, however, there are plenty of gameplay settings and options to tailor your gameplay experience to be more approachable. You can enable infinite hints and even ask the game to reveal the solution to a particular puzzle, too.</p>

<p>Having played both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/new-ai-the-somnium-files-is-latest-switch-2-game-to-include-mouse-mode-support">Switch and Switch 2</a> versions of the game, the latter’s graphical enhancements and load time improvements feel negligible. However, No Sleep for Kaname Date is a visual novel, so the lack of differences don’t really matter much. The Switch 2 version does support Mouse Mode, which I tried out for a bit before reverting back to standard Joy-Con controls. You can navigate escape rooms and Somniums, as well as interact with clues and items. Sure, it’s a nice feature to have but the novelty eventually wears off.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No Sleep for Kaname is a good spin-off for existing AI: The Somnium Files fans. While the Somnium segments haven’t evolved much since their introduction in the first game, the new escape puzzle games are a welcome addition to the series. Despite a new writer taking the helm for this entry, the writing is tonally consistent and the characters are as charming as ever.</p></section>
