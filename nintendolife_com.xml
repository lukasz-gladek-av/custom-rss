<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af87bff3bf78a/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7fExZx1QyU">Digital Foundry</a> has posted its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on the Switch 2, putting the game through its paces to see just how the main story and Phantom Liberty expansion hold up on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>To start, DF notes that the inclusion of Phantom Liberty itself is pretty remarkable given that developer CD Projekt Red opted to skip PS4 and Xbox One, favouring the beefier hardware seen in current-gen systems. The fact that the Switch 2 is able to handle this at all is commendable, but it should be said that this is where the hardware struggles the most.</p>
<p>As standard, Cyberpunk 2077 offers up four visual modes: 30fps quality and 40fps performance, with both also available as separate handheld options. Here's how each mode handles resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handheld Performance - 640x360 - 1280x720</li>
<li>Handheld Quality - 800x450 - 1440x810</li>
<li>Docked Performance - 960x540 - 1920x1080</li>
<li>Docked Quality - 1280x720 - 1920x1080</li>
</ul>
<p>DLSS is in use, but it's noted that high-paced action can cause a few visual hiccups, such as blurriness and temporal noise. However, outside of resolution, there's actually very little difference in visual quality between docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>When compared to other consoles, the Switch is running at the same texture quality setting as the PS5, putting it above Xbox Series X and PS4. Many in-game textures are purposefully the same across all platforms, but where there is a difference, the Switch 2 is actually one of the more accomplished consoles in this respect. Similarly, DLSS is put to great use, making image clarity a lot better on the Switch 2 when compared to the PS4.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the Switch 2 is a lot closer to the PS4 when it comes to pedestrian and vehicle density, so if the streets of Night City look a little quiet on the Switch 2, then you know why. It's largely done to ensure stable frame rates, but DF does still state that what the console is able to achieve is "impressive". With shadows, it's noted that indoor settings produce higher quality shadows than those seen on PS4, but outdoor shadows produced by the sun are actually slightly worse.</p>
<p>With frame rate, the Switch 2 holds up well, sticking to the 30fps target in quality mode for the main story. In the Phantom Liberty expansion, however, the more complex design of the environment causes frame rates on Switch 2 to drop as low as 20-25.</p>
<p>In the 40fps performance mode, the overall experience is a little bit of a mixed bag. Indoor areas are smoother, holding at around 40fps for the most part, but outdoor sections and busy shootouts actually cause the frame rate to drop down to 30fps or even slightly lower.</p>
<p>Finally, when playing handheld, it's estimated that frame rates are largely the same as docked, though DF isn't able to test this area properly. Thanks to VRR, however, it's said that portable play is probably the smoothest experience on Switch 2, though in instances where performance does drop below 30fps, it's a lot more noticeable.</p>

<p>For the dreamers!</p>

<figure><a title="switch 2 demo kiosks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c0f6cb2fc69d/switch-2-demo-kiosks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been absolutely flipping ages since this particular writer has had a go at a good old-fashioned demo kiosk for a Nintendo console (although many, many hours were spent on a SNES one in my local Woolworths back in the day), and so it's very exciting to see them out in the wild and being deployed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>. Nostalgia: it gets us every time.</p>
<p>Yes, we love a good demo kiosk, as you can maybe tell, and we're excited to see that gamers are beginning to spot Switch 2-flavoured kiosks being delivered and set up at various locations in the US, this time in a Target, for instance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9uqpc/nintendo_switch_2_demo_kiosks/">As seen over on Reddit</a>, the Nintendo-red setups enable anyone to get a shot on a bunch of titles. There's no half-measures here, you don't even have to get an angry staff member to switch the cart out when you want to try something else. Now that's progress.</p>

<p>As you can see from the selection of images above, it seems as though potential Switch 2 owners (or people like us who just can't walk past a chance to play something, even if we already own it) can select from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Nice!</p>
<p>The images also show a kiosk with both a Switch and Switch 2 demoed side by side, and everything seems reasonably peaceful. So, no sibling rivalry has set in just yet, then.</p>
<p>Demos on the kiosk in the pics apparently last 10 minutes, and a quick press of the Home button allows you to get back to selecting something else. We sort of want one of these now. Does anyone have Mario's phone number?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Camera 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25f0089c56124/switch-2-camera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the lead-up to the Switch 2 launch, one of the biggest talking points from Nintendo was the new GameChat feature and accompanying camera. Heck, the company even reunited with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/paul-rudd-returns-in-an-awesome-snes-style-switch-2-commercial">actor and SNES legend Paul Rudd</a> for a new commercial showcasing the technology: <em>“Now you’re playing together,”</em> as if the previous four decades of multiplayer functionality on Nintendo consoles meant absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>With the confirmation that pretty much any USB-C camera will work with the Switch 2, just how does the official camera actually hold up, though?</p>
<p>Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, overall. It’s a pretty slick piece of hardware that blends in really well with both the Switch 2 itself and whatever TV setup you happen to be rocking at home (oh, and you can also plug it into a laptop and use it as a webcam, if you like). But despite its 1080p resolution, the actual image quality can look a little muddy, particularly if you have to zoom in. Considering its <strong>£49.99 / $54.99</strong> price tag, this is definitely a tad disappointing.</p>

<p>Looking at the camera itself, it’s a surprisingly dinky little thing. I don’t know why I thought it was much bigger prior to launch, but getting my hands on it for the first time revealed that it sits at just 17cm in height. That’s pretty small! In practice, it’s probably just a tad shorter than the length of my hand from the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger. So definitely nice and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The base and stand feel as though they’re made from metal, pretty solid and slightly cool to the touch. Meanwhile, the base is cushioned to prevent any scratches on the device or whatever surface you happen to place it on. The camera at the top is housed in a circular casing which feels slightly hollow — brittle, even, like one drop on a hard surface could crack it — but the light weight makes it easy to adjust the viewing angle.</p>

<p>As standard, the camera comes with a USB-C cable which you can use to plug it into the top of console via its secondary USB-C slot, while the other end slots into the camera around its backside. About three-quarters of the way down the camera’s stand is a small clip to tidy the cable away slightly. Finally, a thin dial is situated around the lens: turning this anti-clockwise shields the lens with a small, built-in white cover, definitely handy for when you’re not using the camera but can't be bothered to unplug it.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a pretty well-made piece of kit; solid, sleek, functional, and inconspicuous enough to simply blend into the background. Where things get a <em>little</em> messy is when you actually start using it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, setup is an absolute breeze. Once you’ve got it plugged into the Switch 2 (and you can use it in docked or handheld mode), you simply create or join a GameChat session, navigate to the quick settings on-screen, and select the camera icon to turn it on. By default, it’ll show your surroundings, but you can activate a filter to remove this.</p>

<p>The main issue is resolution. I imagine that most, like myself, will have the camera set up next to a TV while docked. In an average family environment, chances are you’re going to be sitting a couple of meters away on a comfy couch. This means that the default image is quite far away, and so you’ll appear pretty small on-screen. Great for showing groups of people during gameplay, sure, (and the camera can pick out four faces), but not if you're on your own.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is you can zoom in via settings to the point where your head takes up most of the image space, but in doing so, the image gets extremely fuzzy.</p>
<p>Of course, the other option is to place the camera a bit nearer, if you’re able. In a lot of living room settings, this might not be entirely feasible, but if you’re playing in a small office environment on a desk or something, then you can probably get pretty close and alleviate those resolution issues.</p>
<p>In addition to the zoom functionality, you can also apply the aforementioned background filter to the image (a system-wide thing and not limited to the official camera). It’s nothing too extravagant, but the two options effectively remove your immediate surroundings. One keeps the overall composition intact, but makes it so that only you display in the image. This is reasonably well done, but be prepared to see a bit of jank around your head and body.</p>

<p>The other display option crops the image down to just your head within a small circle, again applying the same filter to remove anything in the background. The jank from the previous filter still crops up here, and it can be a little irritating in isolation, but when you’re knee-deep in a Knockout Rally on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, chances are you won’t notice it.</p>
<p>What's odd, however, is that Mario Kart World specifically recommends this filter, and I can't quite nail down why. I imagine it's to really hone in on the 'fun, whimsical' nature of the game, but the default setting with no filters applied looks undeniably cleaner.</p>
<p>The only other thing worth noting is that there’s no way to mount the camera on the Switch 2 itself when playing in handheld mode. This is an advantage currently enjoyed by Hori's Piranha Plant Camera, which you can plug into the USB-C slot at the top and carry about with you; I imagine that would definitely come in handy for those quick handheld sessions on the go.</p>
<p>That said, Nintendo's camera does boast a higher resolution, so which you ultimately opt for will depend on what you value more: slightly higher image quality or more flexibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the elegant, sleek design of the official Switch 2 camera, we would have expected the same kind of 'wow' factor to be present in the actual image quality on display. Alas, despite the 1080p resolution, any scenario in which you need to zoom in at all makes the image incredibly fuzzy.</p>
<p>That said, in practice, the novelty of seeing your friends' faces after you've chucked a Blue Shell at them in Mario Kart World is a genuine blast and, in that context, concerns about image quality generally fade away. We've no doubt that third parties will come out with more accomplished, feature-rich cameras in the future, but for now, Nintendo's official offering is a solid, albeit nonessential option.</p>
