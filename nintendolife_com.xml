<figure><a title="Metroid II Samus Death" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1aef3c12c3ab/metroid-ii-samus-death.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I recently started playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> for the first time. I’m not sure why. Maybe it was a way of staving off my intense cravings for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which as of writing still doesn’t have a launch date more concrete than the vague '2025' window Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/nintendo-highlights-multiple-switch-games-launching-in-2025">over a year ago</a>. In any case, Metroid II impressed me almost immediately, but it wasn’t until I saw heroine Samus Aran die that I realised just how unique it is in relation to the rest of the series.</p>
<p>While the video game industry places a lot of importance on the benefits of more powerful hardware, developers can also do incredible things when presented with limitations. Metroid II, released in North America in late 1991 before making its way to Japan and Europe the following year, is a great example of this phenomenon. The changes made to ensure the nascent Metroid formula was readable on the Game Boy’s small, colourless screen resulted in a handheld adventure still praised today for its austere atmosphere.</p>
<p>Metroid II is claustrophobic, at least when compared to its predecessor on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The rooms in both games may not be much different in size, but the portable sequel focuses so closely on Samus that it often feels as if there’s barely any space to navigate its tunnels and passageways. Metroid II’s perspective shift, combined with its story about genociding the series’ eponymous parasites, makes for a game that’s dark and oppressive while still managing to feel like a natural next step in what, at the time, was a young franchise.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Power Metroid II" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f216abb657df/nintendo-power-metroid-ii.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first few hours with Metroid II were uneventful. I messed around with the controls and acclimated to the grayscale environments of the Metroid homeworld before settling in to Samus’ mission of extermination. As these things often go, I soon found myself low on health courtesy of the planet’s dangerous inhabitants. I scrambled to reach a previous save point to avoid losing several precious minutes of progress, but eventually my reserve energy tanks hit zero after taking too many hits. And that’s when Samus surprised me by simply… fading away.</p>
<p>I’ve grown accustomed to one of two things happening when you die in a Metroid game. The first, seen in almost every other 2D instalment, is that Samus and her suit will explode into several pieces. The second – and infinitely more traumatic, at least in the case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> – is watching Samus’ visor blink out from a first-person point of view and then being treated to the sounds of her heart flatlining and/or the image of blood spreading slowly across the game over screen. Dying is climactic and every game in the series makes it feel important.</p>
<p>Well, every game except Metroid II, of course. As shown in the video below, Samus doesn't explode, and the game over screen is nothing more than white text on a black screen. She just ceases to exist, the hundreds of pixels that make up her sprite disappearing line by line until nothing is left. The game leads us to believe Samus is the only person capable of eliminating the Metroid threat, but it treats her defeat with hardly any reverence at all.</p>

<p>The observable universe is calculated to be a region of <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/how-big-universe">about 410 nonillion cubic light-years</a> potentially containing as many habitable planets <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/the-milky-way-is-flush-with-habitable-planets-study-says">as there are grains of sand</a> on all of Earth’s beaches, and that’s just what we can see with current technology. Reality itself <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/is-the-universe-infinite">could very well be infinite</a>. Sure, our limited perspective may make us feel like we’re all there is, but in the grand scheme of things, what impact does the life of any one person truly have on the universe as a whole? If a global population of <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population">over 8.2 billion people</a> amounts to just a drop in the universal bucket, then the death of a single bounty hunter — or even a handful of space jellyfish — is so cosmically insignificant, it may as well have not happened at all.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say if Nintendo intended to impart this kind of existential crisis with Metroid II. Maybe the developers struggled with translating the death animation from the previous game onto the Game Boy screen and felt a short fade-out would be enough to convey Samus’ demise. Metroid II may seem like an outlier when compared to the rest of the franchise thanks to the perspective provided by the intervening decades, but at the time of its release, it was just the second game in the series. Aspects of the Metroid formula we take for granted today were still being hammered out. It’s entirely possible I’m placing too much importance on a three-second animation.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid: Samus Returns" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98efe4f1c9c12/metroid-samus-returns.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Samus' fade-out was one of many details addressed in the remake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_samus_returns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a>, but I think I prefer the original's more unsettling approach. — <em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But isn’t that what’s great about art? It allows us to go deep on topics that may seem thin on paper but touch us in meaningful ways. A small team at Nintendo made a relatively minor decision about what happens when the player dies, and almost 34 years later, it’s making me think about my place in the universe.</p>
<p>Even today, Metroid II is a crowning achievement, equal parts compelling in its presentation and impressive in how it manages to provide a sprawling adventure on the first-generation Game Boy. Its utter indifference towards Samus Aran relegates her to an insignificance that stands in stark contrast to the almost godlike figure she’s become in modern instalments. While the rest of the series often turns Samus’ death into the kind of spectacle reserved for fallen heroes, Metroid II instead reflects our own vast, unfeeling universe with what amounts to a shrug. We all just fade away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157869/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>There's usually a number of a certain type of game that drops when a brand new console arrives on the scene. You know the ones, the quirky ones, the ones that utilise new tech and features — such as the Switch 2's camera and game-sharing abilities — to give us something we haven't seen before.</p>
<p>And so it is that we come to be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, one of these very sorts of early-gen experiences, this time one that's centred around using GameShare (although you can also play solo) to effectively sit around an outdoor fire pit and shoot the proverbial. You know, catch up on old times with your pals. And with GameShare, you only need one copy to then have up to four people in total involved in the fun. So, for the price of $14.99 / £13.49, even though it's a slim affair, you can maximise your value by having other folk who're willing to get involved.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157871/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>But involved in what exactly, you buffoon?</em> I hear you ask. Well, besides sitting at the fire, you can walk around a small space to gather up wood to keep the flames going, a puzzle game in itself, and there are a few different places to unlock and camp at.</p>
<p>In fact, chillin' isn't necessarily a thing you'll do a lot of early doors, as you get used to finding, chopping, and chucking wood into the fire. As a professional gamer, of course, I'm a naturally panicky person outdoors, so there was a little settling-in time before I realised that you don't really need to sweat the technique, as they say, when it comes to your fire. Not in the normal mode at least.</p>
<p>So, your aim then is to keep the fire burning, sometimes for a specific amount of time, even, and you've got a hatchet and some tongs for picking up and chopping wood into various sizes on your chopping stump. Small is good for getting things started, etc.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157872/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You've also got a wind blower, which any self-respecting fire...eh...firemaker professional will know exactly what to do with. Besides this, you also get an infinite supply of marshmallows to toast. And let me tell you something, my camping cousins, I've burned about 1,000 of these tasty treats trying to nail it, so there's definitely 'game' to be had here for anyone who thinks it's a walking sim.</p>
<p>There's then a puzzle aspect introduced as you unlock survival/challenge versions of the various camp spots the game has to offer. Now you'll need to stack things just so and do your best <em>a little better</em> as the game gives you other things, like wind, to consider. Have you ever considered wind?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna just spoil everything — it's all still very chill, make no mistake — but there's more to do here than you might expect, basically. To this end, there are also a lot of things to tick off, with in-built achievements for doing certain things in certain ways that'll keep interested parties busy for a while.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157870/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In multiplayer, you can choose to have your camera and/or mic turned on or off, and the game will show you a little circular video feed of your pal(s) that moves around to collect wood or sit at the fireside. It's funny, cute, and amusing enough for a time. This mode also introduces the ability to converse, of course. While sitting and chatting (and, indeed, chillin') by the fire, if you're having trouble with topics — we can't all be natural lily-guilders — the game will provide them on the fly, with just a press down on the D-pad giving you some random things to think on at any given time.</p>
<p>Beyond lots of cheevos built in, you can also spend camping points (yes, I'm being serious, what of it?) on customising your gear. So you can have a silly-looking hatchet or what have you, or a magic wand. Knock yourself out, mate, it's all good with me. I have my own kinks to think about.</p>
<p>Now, it's fairly hard to review a game like this, in all honesty, because your mileage is going to vary massively. There isn't a whole lot to do here, and the slow movement of the camera and very small areas make it all feel a little turgid and rigid for an experience that's meant to be about relaxing outside. So there's a negative. Also, in related news, there's no way to change your control layout, which is gonna be a shame for any of your squad who can't do the default layout, for whatever reason.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157873/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>However! On a more positive note, if you have family or friends in remote locations, or you want to (re)connect with people in a new way, it works fine. A game with Nintendo Life's video legend, Felix, and I'm convinced that the tech is sound and you can see and chat to friends with very little effort expended.</p>
<p>Beyond those who want to use it socially, though? I'm not sure it has any legs. The core is just too shallow and simple, and I'm left wondering if this sort of thing wouldn't work better as part of a compendium of similar social efforts that utilise the tech in cool ways. As a standalone thing, it's sort of hard to justify, even at a reduced price, although it isn't completely without merit.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Certainly a novel way to connect with pals, and not without merit in its relaxing blend of gathering wood and testing yourself to keep the fire burning, Chillin' By The Fire has its positives. The GameShare aspects, when playing with friends, work well and are easy to set up, and it's nice to be able to buy one copy and then invite folk along. I also enjoyed the light puzzling for a time as I worked to keep my fire alive.</p>
<p>However, beyond these basic aspects and some achievements, and especially for solo players, there's not much else here.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b44fcfe89baf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price is continuing to skyrocket following the early success of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a>, the company's share price currently sits at a staggering <strong>¥14,355</strong>. For context, this is now double Nintendo's value at the height of the Wii era.</p>
<p>On 31st October 2007, the markets closed with Nintendo sitting at <strong>¥7,170</strong>. Naturally, things took a turn for the worse following this, thanks in part to the 2008 financial crisis and the unfortunate failure of the Wii U in 2012.</p>
<p>But now, with Nintendo recently confirming that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">sold more than 6 million Switch 2 units</a> since its launch on 5th June 2025, things are looking up (and up, and up). In addition, it's made no chances to its forecast for the year ahead, meaning the company expects to sell at least 15 million Switch 2 units before the end of the financial year. Wowie zowie!</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Share Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b821061d0d27/nintendo-share-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reception around the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World Direct</a> has been mixed, to say the least, but it's clear that Nintendo has a pretty solid line-up of Switch 2 games in the months ahead. You've got first-party titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, along with big third-party offerings like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a>.</p>
<p>Uncertainty lingers around the price of the Switch 2 – particularly following recent price increases of Switch 1 hardware in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-how-much-nintendo-switch-online-is-going-up-in-canada">Canada</a> – and there remains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">significant discontent around Game-Key Cards</a> for the Switch 2, but right now, it appears that Nintendo is well and truly on top of the world.</p>
<p>Finally, for comparison, here's how a few other key companies are doing at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capcom - ¥3,959</li>
<li>Square Enix - ¥11,055</li>
<li>Sony - ¥3,995</li>
<li>Konami - ¥24,560</li>
<li>Bandai Namco - ¥5,317</li>
<li>Sega - ¥3,306</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm pretty spoiled for choice this weekend folks, I won't lie. I'm planning on playing a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> after my recent review, but I also want to dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> and see what all the fuss is about. I also downloaded the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> demo, so I'd like to give that a shot, but then I also need to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a> for review.</p>
<p>Man... Too much!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>UFO 50 is staring me right in the face as I mop up 100% completion on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and look ahead to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>. What timing for a game I’ve been really excited to play since SGF last year?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’ll be trying out the Mina the Hollower demo because apparently we’re just going through a bunch of Zelda-esque game demos right now. A short and sweet one from me, folks – have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>After waiting all this time to dive into Mina the Hollower, I still haven’t found the time to dive into the demo yet — I know! Madness! I’ll be excited to take that for a spins this weekend, before probably booting up one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games on NSO to scratch more of the retro Zelda itch.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it’s the Global Jam session for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> and I’m actually… kind of excited to check it out? I wasn’t blown away at the Switch 2 hands-on event earlier in the year, but perhaps playing it with some worldwide competition will help change my mind.</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I find myself still knee-deep in banana shards and loving every second of it. I'm down to sublayer 1200-summin', and I'd be a damn-sight further if I weren't constantly distracted by some glinting goodie in the distance or a buried banana shadow revealed by a sonar slap.</p>
<p>However, UFO 50 arrived on Thursday to challenge DK to supremacy on my Switch 2, and I'm absolutely itching to get stuck into that, too. Not the best weekend to have relatives arriving for a holiday, to be honest. Bloody family, with their love and support and effort to come visit me in foreign climes. Don't they know I've got bananas to smash!?</p>

<p>I'm packing my bags for the annual offline vacations. On those very same bags I take 250 days straight of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer</a>. All good things must come to an end, so that’s my season finale on that “game”. It is still very much the “Summer of the Ninja” around here, so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will carry me on this and the next weekend, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> and the last third of World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (hey, Sagat is here! But it takes real money to get him… curse these new ways of the industry).</p>
<p>Did a bit of binge-spending yesterday on the eShop so also on my bag goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">House of the Dead 2 Remake</a>, the wonderful UFO 50, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> (go watch the movie, seriously!) and M2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gradius_origins">Gradius Origins</a>, which comes with the brand new, 1998 theoretical sequel Salamander III. Since I also failed miserably not to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on STEAM last week it’s going to be one great Summer for shmup action!</p>
<p>This will be my first time taking the Switch 2 on the road and looking back at the last eight Summers where the original Switch model was a constant slice of my cherish memories, can’t help but feel really excited looking at what’s to come, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> being a particularly strong bleep on my radar.</p>

<p>When Capcom released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 in June, it also launched three new amiibo as well as an amiibo card starter set containing 22 cards.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the second series of cards has appeared online. According to multiple listings, this set will feature new cards for the existing roster of fighters and cards for the "Year 2 and Year 3" DLC characters. Some of the artwork on Amazon shows close-ups of the cards for Elena, A.K.I. and M. Bison.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the 38 new cards, along with a box including 15 boosters. Capcom hasn't officially revealed when the new set of cards will be made available just yet, but when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7proxwq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In-game, these cards allow you to save your character's costumes, colours and control type, along with button settings. You can also unlock items like wallpapers and photo frames.</p>
<p>This news for Street Fighter 6 follows on from the release of the DLC fighter Sagat earlier this week. Along with this, Capcom has also updated the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> with four characters for <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/capcom-fighting-collection-2-free-title-update-now-live-on-switch-and-switch-2">Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Capcom <a href="https://youtu.be/vVHYuILrqFM">recently released a "demonstration video"</a> about how Street Fighter 6's amiibo work on Switch 2.</p>
