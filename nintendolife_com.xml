<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Summer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46cf203a669d5/animal-crossing-new-horizons-summer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>A brand new survey of 180,000 players aged 15-69 years old in Japan has been conducted by GEM Partners, and there are some interesting stats on gender and age splits across multiple Nintendo franchises.</p>
<p>Posted by <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01178/00010/">Nikkei</a> (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lugwlbfams2u">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> and <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/21/japan-large-survey-shows-nintendo-games-gender-split-and-average-ages/">MyNintendoNews</a>), the huge survey reveals that, compared to other game IPs, Nintendo's have more female fans,.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> comes in at 75% female, with an average age of 35 years old, while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby</a> series fanbase is sat at 55% female amongst those surveyed, with players at an average age of 30.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5gpnumr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpG4hedNmz8" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>A few more balanced series' come in the form of, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pok√©mon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>, both rocking a 60:40 ratio (in favour of male). This is all quite the turnaround when compared with the surveys' result for "Games In General", which shows a 75:25 spilt in favour of males aged 30 and over.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario</a> holds a 70:30 split, with player age average sitting at 32, while a more recent series in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> sits at a 65:35 split, with the average player range being below 30.</p>
<p>The average age for two of the big Japanese RPG titans that started life on Nintendo consoles, <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> and <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, sits at 42, which is tied with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disney_tsum_tsum_festival">Disney Tsum Tsum</a> as having the oldest average player base among the games surveyed.</p>
<p>Other interesting tidbits include the fact that the survey found the vast majority of gamers were young mobile players, whilst Nintendo's IPs, in relation to other consoles, attract the most young players (obvious), but also the most over 30s (not as obvious!).</p>
<p>The survey makes for fascinating reading, and while many of the results are predictable, there's plenty of little factoids that you might not have guess before! Of course, this only covers Japanese players, and it's only a slice of the market, but it's a good insight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>When we reviewed the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> for Switch 2 just a little while back, we came away as impressed as ever with IO Interactive's incredible world-building and gameplay. However, we were also a little bit disappointed with the game's performance at launch.</p>
<p>For a title we really love on other platforms, it was unfortunate to have to mark it down to a relatively disappointing 7/10 as a result of some fairly constant choppiness in both docked and handheld modes. And so we are delighted to discover that those boffins over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ6Mkwkvyxs">Digital Foundry</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hitman-world-of-assassination-seems-to-have-an-undocumented-performance-mode">cheers, Eurogamer</a>) seem to have found an unannounced 'performance mode' of sorts that we can all benefit from. Hooray for boffins!</p>
<p>According to DF's Richard Leadbetter, he received an email which notified him that a player had gone into the console system settings to have a muck about due to the fluctuating framerate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I went into the system settings and changed the TV output res from 4K to 720p, went back into the game and found it vastly improves performance. The Hawkes Bay Mission ran at... a very solid and stable frame-rate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter then proceeded to put this to the test, capturing various scenes from the game's whistle-stop tour of the globe at 4K, 1080p and 720p. Choosing areas that push the GPU and CPU, and give us lots of crowd density, the results, he comments, are very interesting.</p>
<p>In the game's Whittleton Creek level, as an example, a setting of 4K output manages an average framerate of 46.88fps - which then rises to 59.95fps at 720p. A 62.5% improvement!</p>
<p>At 1080p, things get more interesting still:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...the game actually seems to be rendering at a slightly higher resolution, with pixel counts suggesting 1152p to 1188p. Meanwhile, with Switch 2 set to 4K, performance drops but pixel counts are still in the same 1152p/1188p window. The performance drop may be down to upscaling to a higher resolution with an approximate cost of around 2.4ms compared to what we assume is the same content without any upscaling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter continues, unsure whether Hitman is using DLSS to upscale, "as there are rounded edges where we'd expect to see aliasing." DF has reached out to IO interactive for confirmation.</p>
<p>The team has also checked out the game's super cool Berlin level, reporting that things jump up by some 61% when knocked down to 720p, whilst 1080p is 9% faster.</p>

<p>Moving on to CPU-intensive crowded areas, and as expected the frame rate jumps aren't quite so sensational once you factor in a ton of NPCs. However, you are looking at a jump, according to DF, from around 35fps in the Paris fashion show stage, to in and around the 45fps mark, which is still rather tasty.</p>
<p>So, whilst this isn't an actual performance mode, hence why it hasn't been mentioned officially by the devs, you <em>can</em> pick up some nice frame boosts <em>if</em> you're willing to drop your resolution down a little. More interestingly, the disparity in these numbers should, says Leadbetter, enable DF to get a better handle on the computational costs of Nintendo's DLSS implementation on the new console going forward. Something that's been a bit of a mystery up until this point!</p>
<p>IO Interactive has also recently announced that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hitman-developer-is-working-on-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now">working hard on Switch 2 performance issues</a>, so hopefully we won't have to sacrifice picture clarity for too long.</p>
<p><em>Have you been playing Hitman: World of Assassination? Tempted to drop the resolution down for some extra frames? Let us know!</em></p>
