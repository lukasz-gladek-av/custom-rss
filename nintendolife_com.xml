<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Banaza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6208a08d7ff13/donkey-kong-banaza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 only arrived last week, but Nintendo is already building up the hype for its next game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, or want something else from the new hardware, this new 3D Donkey Kong will be launching next month on <strong>17th July</strong>. Nintendo has issued a reminder about this via social media, which gives fans another quick glimpse at DK destroying <em>everything</em> in sight and "surfing on a rock".</p>

<p>We went hands on with Donkey Kong Bananza in April and described it as a "brilliantly bonkers" game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Donkey Kong has been living on the sidelines for a while now, Bananza truly is his time to shine, and what we got to play around with was a solid and delightfully stress-relieving bolt of silliness that we desperately need right now. We're hoping there are some more jungly levels out in the wilderness, but this could well be DK's breakout game. And he more than deserves it."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While we wait for DK to arrive, there are plenty of other first and third-party Switch 2 games to enjoy including titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

<p>So, the countdown for DK's 3D outing is officially underway. Will you be adding this one to your Switch 2 library when it arrives next month? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/96327f4900f30/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following Nintendo's news about the Switch 2 becoming the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">"fastest-selling Nintendo hardware" ever in the US</a>, we've now got some numbers to go with it, courtesy of Circana’s analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>According to Piscatella, this is an "all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US", with "over 1.1 million units sold" (week ending June 7, 2025). The previous record was held by Sony's PlayStation 4, and the sales calculated here for the Switch 2 exclude My Nintendo Store purchases.</p>
<p>Additionally, 79% of US buyers purchased the Switch 2 exclusive launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on release – either physically or as part of the system bundle.</p>
<p>On the software front, Mario Kart World is leading physical game sales in this same location, followed by CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in second place, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</a> in third. Unsurprisingly, the new Mario Kart has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">dominated software sales</a> on the Switch 2 in other regions in the first week.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2 had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units globally"</a> in its first four days, making it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" ever in this amount of time.</p>
