<figure data-uuid="2bfba38005c21"><a title="PB Tails Crush 550 TMR Controller For Switch 1 &amp; 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2bfba38005c21/pb-tails-crush-550-tmr-controller-for-switch-1-and-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this year, PB Tails' <a href="https://www.pbtails.com/products/metal-defender-crush-bluetooth-wireless-gaming-controllers-tmr-joystick">Metal Crush Defender TMR controller</a> caught my eye, with its <strong>Fallout</strong>-inspired, distressed yellow stylings and glistening chrome sticks. I don't usually go in for 'relic' effects on anything, but this looked a bit special. It felt artful and novel in a market where neon gamer gear dominates, screaming for attention, and 'cheapening' otherwise decent equipment. The Xbox face button layout, though, meant it wasn't specifically relevant to Switch owners.</p>
<p>Fast-forward several months, and there's <a href="https://www.pbtails.com/products/550-spyder-crush-controller-limited-edition-with-k-silver-tmr-joysticks">a new model</a> bearing Nintendo's classic button layout. Retailing for $79.99, this is the firm's familiar Crush pad but with '50s automotive stylings - specifically, it's celebrating the 70th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_550">Porsche 550 Spyder</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mjlwty&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>There's no official licensing on this tribute, but the finish is beautiful, if you're into that sort of thing. The red light strip along the bottom edge (you can change the colour - more on that later) looks like a tail light, while the decals and details across the face, plus the silver paint job and the 'grille', faux-number plate, and red strips on the rear, give the feel of a quality piece of retro memorabilia. The burgundy trim of the D-pad and the shoulder buttons add to the classy, retro stylings, too.</p>

<p>Opinion among Team NL is divided — you'll need to be a classic car connoisseur or have a thing for mechanical engineering and retro design — but I love the look and feel. It's a niche aesthetic and the pad won't suit every gaming purpose, but there's a luxuriousness to the finish and the chrome accents that gets my motor running. You feel like you should be playing with leather driving gloves when you're handling this thing (and maybe I did).</p>
<p>In the hands, gloved or otherwise, this Crush pad feels like an old-school Xbox 360 controller, but weightier, and definitely glossier. The metal of the default sticks is just the beginning, and the slickness of the bodywork is probably a dealbreaker if you main games that give you sweaty palms.</p>
<p>Fingerprints were my immediate concern on taking the pad from its black and white case and removing the little foam collars around the sticks, but surprisingly, I haven't found them an issue. I assumed I'd need a microfiber cloth after every session, but it's been fine sitting on the side over the past couple of weeks, despite the dust on my TV shelf and my sticky gamer paws.</p>

<p>A braided USB-A to C cable is included for charging (the claimed 30-hour life feels accurate, although that'll depend on your lighting intensity), plus a dongle for 2.4G wireless connection and plastic/rubber sticks if you want to swap out the zinc alloy pair.</p>
<p>And honestly? If you're into your online shooters or just want to be competitive in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, you'll want to switch the stick covers; channel-hopping in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> was a dream, a tense shootout in Springfield less so. I had no issue racing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> or unleashing ninja skills in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, but chromed metal just doesn't offer enough grip for split-second, precision inputs.</p>
<p>The sticks themselves are the TMR variety, so power efficient and offering commensurate performance and protection against drift to Hall Effect. Obviously, it'll take a year or two of use to thoroughly test their resilience, but there's nothing to suggest they'll start wandering. They feel robust and responsive.</p>
<p>Changing the sticks involves removing the magnetic faceplate, which can be tricky if you don't have decent nails, but gripping the front housing up around the shoulder buttons while pressing down on the sticks with your thumbs will eventually prise the cover away. Swap out the metal ones, clip the caps into the plastic domes, pop the cover back on, and you're away.</p>

<p>PB sells other faceplates, although it would be weird to buy one of these and then ruin the aesthetic with a clear orange cover. Also worth noting is that the carry case's foam insert holds the two-part plastic sticks only, so you'll need to store the metal ones safely somewhere else.</p>
<p>Removing the chrome ones feels like sacrilege, though, like you've whacked some cheap rims on a vintage Jag. It functions well, with gyro controls, some very nice rumble (the growl it makes when it connects to the console feels, brilliantly, like a revving engine), and pleasingly springy analogue triggers. The D-pad felt fine for a blast through some NSO classics, and the whole controller has a premium-feeling heft to it.</p>
<p>Even the RGB lighting feels somehow sophisticated here. Holding down the 'T' (turbo) button and moving the left stick lets you pick the exact colour of the light strip, while the right stick changes the face and central Home buttons. You can tweak the intensity of the LEDs, too, and I appreciated that it's all there and selectable via the pad itself, no external software needed. You can't buy a lightbulb these days without downloading a bloody app.</p>

<p>Face button lighting presets are selectable, as well: Super Famicom-style is the default, but you've also got PlayStation blue with the customary hues of Sony's shapes, or Xbox green and corresponding button colours. There's also a Dreamcast-style option - at least I think that's what the orange home button and this colour layout are referencing. Obviously, the Nintendo ABYX labelling remains, but it's a neat nod to other platforms.</p>
<p>No clicky microswitches is a big plus, personally; all the face buttons feel nicely responsive without the irritating, cheap-sounding click that makes playing in a quiet space irritating. Toggling the switch on the top edge changes from 'S' (Switch) to 'X' (XInput), and everything functioned exactly as you'd expect when testing with Steam using the included dongle (or wired if you prefer) and iOS over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>While you get added turbo options via the aforementioned button, you don't get NFC reader for amiibo or a 'C' button for easy Switch 2 GameChat access. There's no headphone jack, either, so headset gamers should look elsewhere, and you don't get any fancy back buttons, either.</p>
<p>Another minor quirk is that '-' and '+' here are in the position of the Home and Capture buttons on Nintendo's controller, so prepare for some accidental screenshots at first. Also, you can't wake your Switch 2 up with this - not an issue for me as I always turn it on via the console, but some people really like the convenience of grabbing the pad down the side of the sofa and powering on.</p>
<p>This isn't the kind of pad you'll leave jammed down the side of the sofa, though. For $80, there are functions missing that you might hope to have. If you only get one controller for Switch 2, look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Nintendo's own option</a> or something from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">8Bitdo</a>. You're really paying for the <em>style</em> here. The Crush 550 needs pairing with a high-backed, leather-studded chair and a glass of Margaux while enjoying a visual novel or a light puzzler. It's <em>not</em> what you want if you're in the midst of a nailbiting deathmatch, perspiring between frantic frags and Dorito downtime. You wouldn't want to rag this into the ground with twitch shooters.</p>

<p>It really depends what kind of gamer you are, then. I find this a pleasure to play with, and I'll be using it whenever a game doesn't demand more performance than it can manage. A classic car is a perfect comparison; this is a fair-weather pad, a beautiful Sunday driver you take out only when conditions allow. If you're in the market for something for the weekend and value-for-money is less important than sophistication, this will look and feel great in your showroom.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the estimated digital file sizes for the Switch and Switch 2 Edition of Samus' long-awaited adventure have also gone live on the eShop and official Nintendo website. So, if you didn't already know, here's what you can expect:</p>
<h3>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Estimated File Size<br></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch) - <strong>28.9 GB</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - <strong>31.6 GB</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Of course, these sizes are still classed as an "estimate" at the moment and are subject to change before and after release, depending on the patches and updates distributed. The eShop also has Metroid Prime 4's Upgrade Pack listed as <strong>1.5 GB</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> (based on the first Prime entry) is just under 7 GB according to the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-be-a-cross-gen-title-for-switch-2">previously confirmed</a>, the Switch 2 version of Metroid Prime 4 supports higher resolution, faster frame rates, HDR and mouse controls. When in docked mode, players can choose from 4K at 60fps (quality) or 1080p at 120fps (performance). And in handheld/tabletop mode, the options are 1080p at 60fps (quality) and 720p at 120fps (performance).</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The end of 2025 is fast approaching, so I've found myself going back to some of this year's releases to see which games might make their way into my top five. It was perhaps a mistake to boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, however, as those who have played it will know what an absolute monster it is. Maybe I'll put a few hours into it before moving on to something else, we'll see...</p>
<p>I've also recently gone back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/evil_within">The Evil Within</a> on the PS5. I can't believe it's over ten years old already! I do really love it though, even if it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.<br>
Happy gaming, folks!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The <em>tap, tap, tap</em> of 2026 on my door has kicked me into gear to finally finish <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. I am about 15-20 hours in, and boy, do I feel pain. It's a lot — like, <em>a lot</em> — but I haven't been this all-consumed by a game in a long old time.</p>
<p>I'm breaking up my Lumière sad times with the odd run of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, which has also proven to be right up my street. Karl has been my go-to for longer runs so far, but I am becoming increasingly attached to my beloved frog wizard, Brome, and his adorable little animations. Let's hope I can get at least one run wrapped up before a certain space bounty hunter zooms into view next month.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>With GOTY approaching, I'm in catch-up mode. This weekend, I'll be carrying on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and hopefully returning to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>. Non-2025, I've also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> recently. How I wish Nintendo would put analogue triggers back in their controllers!</p>
<p>Not 'playing', but game-related, I'm eager to catch up with the movie-length <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" rel="noopener noreferrer">NES 40th anniversary Portland Retro Gaming Expo panel</a> which went up earlier in November. And news of Rebecca Heineman's passing had me looking back over 40+ years of her work, so the 3DO port of Doom and <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgertime videos</a> are calling. <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" href="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" rel="noopener noreferrer">F cancer, indeed</a>.</p>

<div><p>A couple of Steam releases caught my eye this weekend, and I do hope to see them both on consoles down the line. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/">Sektori</a> are the spiritual sequels you never knew you needed to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/geometry_wars_galaxies">Geometry Wars</a>, respectively. Princess woes continue with both Zelda and Melinoë still at odds with Ganon and Chronos (and Typhon, I guess) in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> (now in physical cartridge glory, hurrah!) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I do hope I get to tackle more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, it is one of the biggest surprises of the year IMO. In the middle of all this, I feel a lot of folks are overlooking a stellar Switch release that was nearly my game of the week if not for a certain pink ball: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neon_inferno">Neon Inferno</a>. I have been eagerly waiting for this one for some time now, and it is delivering on every front.</p><p>

Game of the week is, without surprise, Kirby Air Riders. I know the original GameCube title (which is on my shelf) didn’t really raise many eyebrows back in 2003, but I am hopeful a lot more people get to slide around with it this time. It is another finely crafted SORA masterpiece that will certainly keep yours truly occupied until December arrives.</p></div>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I found a very neat game on Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Astro Prospector</a>. It's about £5. Maybe less. And it's brilliant — this little snack-sized incremental game that's all about shooting asteroids and dodging bullets. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> meets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with coffee theming.</p>
<p>Other than that, still plugging away at Hades II! I stopped for a while to let the ending get patched and to help judge an indie game competition (which is where I discovered Astro Prospector), but now both of those are done, I'm back on the grind. I'm not rushing towards the ending just yet, as I'm having more fun trying out silly builds and unlocking new weapons, and after that, I might move on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, since I'm hearing good buzz about it (and the new <strong>Monster Factory</strong> episodes have me wanting to play <strong>Fallout</strong>-type games again).</p>

<p>With this in mind, the latest one is now live and it offers up a Whimsicott based on the same one used by Federico Camporesi to win the 2025 Pokémon North America International Championships (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1991841929357893758">Serebii.net</a>). This also lines up with the 2026 Latin America International Championships running this weekend.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-mwkAYKvypQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5msplku&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>This week, Nintendo launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> exclusively on the Switch 2. Alongside this, it also released a new line of amiibo.</p>
<p>These amiibo are bigger than many other amiibo and allow you to swap each of the characters between vehicles. They're also more expensive. As for their abilities, you'll be able to summon "figure players" and train them up. You can also unlock some rewards when you scan them.</p>
<p>The release of these new amiibo this week has got us wondering if you've decided to add any of them to your collection and how you're finding them so far. So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adsvixmh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<figure data-uuid="b4a140be28475"><a title="Onimusha 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b4a140be28475/onimusha-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this year, Capcom surprised fans with the announcement of a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The same title eventually arrived in March of this year, and now in another update, Capcom has this week released a demo, which you can download right now from the eShop. According to the official description, it will allow players to experience the "gripping prologue" as you dive into the samurai action.</p>
<p>In our review of Onimusha 2 on the Switch, we mentioned how it was a faithful revival of one of the PS2's best games and included plenty of quality-of-life updates and extras that fans (and newcomers) were sure to appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a strong, worthy successor to the original that is now at its absolute best on Switch. Some of it feels dated by modern standards, with fixed camera angles that arguably should have been ditched back in 2002, but it still feels incredibly fun regardless."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_warlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a> was also previously released on the Switch in 2019, if you want to start from the beginning.</p>
