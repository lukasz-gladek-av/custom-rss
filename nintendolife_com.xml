<p>From Z-A and beyond</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Not content with <em>only</em> releasing a new mainline game and tickets to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/a-new-pokemon-pop-up-store-is-coming-to-london-next-year">upcoming pop-up store</a> in October, The Pokémon Company is bringing even more monster-catching content to the UK in the coming weeks with a new series of the <strong>Pokémon Horizons</strong> anime.</p>
<p>Part one of the third season, subtitled 'Rising Hope', will arrive on BBC iPlayer on <strong>27th October</strong>, with more episodes following in the future. Those in the US will have to wait a little longer before it makes its regional debut on Netflix on 6th January 2026.</p>
<p>Here's an official synopsis of what we can expect from this third season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been one year since the events in Laqua left the Rising Volt Tacklers without a leader and a way forward, but a mysterious pink mist that harms Pokémon spurs Liko and Roy into action! Both Trainers have gained confidence and strength alongside their Pokémon, including Roy’s newest friend, a yellow Lucario capable of Mega Evolution. They’re joined by Dot, an intel-gathering expert, and Ult, a brash young Trainer who considers Roy his rival. Determined to rebuild the Rising Volt Tacklers and fulfill a promise made in Laqua, Liko, Roy, and friends are training harder than ever as they take on the Explorers and forge a new path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all of that means nothing to you, then you can catch up on seasons one and two on iPlayer right now to work out what's going down with Liko, Roy and the gang.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> arrives before all that, with both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions launching next week on 16th October.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/motordoom">Motördoom</a> boasts one of those genre mash-ups that it can be difficult to understand, on paper, what's going on. It's a "freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/motordoom-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTU8fWvPp7Dq5U_BZMlbV3GIMzEFtFiA_kA3ELJP5YUD__DqMb">eShop listing</a> reads, which feels like a lot of words for what can basically be boiled down to, <em>kill demons while pulling off sick BMX skills</em>.</p>
<p>This one arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th November</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (the EU page is not live at the time of writing), and it looks really rather gnarly. The above trailer tells you everything you need to know. It's a roguelike where you have to kill as many of the horde demons as possible while pulling off combos on your chainsaw-driven pit bike. Has anything made you want to shout "<em>dude!!</em>" more?</p>
<p>Developer Hobo Cat Games has added a dash of deckbuilder gameplay (because <em>of course</em>) in the shape of cards that boost your abilities, and there are unlockable characters and bikes to give you something to work towards between runs. And putting the 'k' in rogueli<em>k</em>e, an overall meta-progression system will have you gaining bike add-ons for better builds as you go.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>◆Career Mode (Inspired by classic extreme sports games)<br>
◆Single Run Mode (Highscore Mode)<br>
◆Endless Run Mode (Highscore Mode without Time or Level limit)<br>
◆Free Ride Mode<br>
◆Difficulty settings for all skill levels<br>
◆5 Arenas<br>
◆7 Characters<br>
◆5 Bosses<br>
◆35 different Demonic Offering Cards<br>
◆Unlockable Bike Add-Ons<br>
◆Unlockable Bike and Rider Skins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old school polygonal art style might not be to everyone's tastes, but after launching on Steam last year, you just know that such a gnarly mash-up will be up someone's street.</p>
