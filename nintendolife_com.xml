<figure data-uuid="7d3a145cddbe0"><a title="Black Flag" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d3a145cddbe0/black-flag.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>A curious new listing for an <strong>Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster art book</strong> has appeared on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=nlife-21&amp;ascsubtag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon UK</a> in what may be the clearest indication yet that Ubisoft is gearing up to release an updated version of its swashbuckling classic.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, the listing states that the book is scheduled for launch on <strong>24th March 2026</strong> and is being published by Titan. Its price is currently £29.95, a 25% reduction on its £39.99 RRP. There are few additional details at this stage, and even the use of the word 'Remaster' is seemingly at odds with the '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced">Resynced</a>' moniker we've been hearing for a while now.</p>
<p>Still, this definitely seems to be a thing, and is yet another indication that a reveal may be imminent... sort of. A lot of things are up in the air at the moment since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">Ubisoft announced major restructuring</a> at the company. Seven games currently in development have been delayed, so it's unclear if Resynced is included in the lineup.</p>
<p>We should hear more from Ubisoft later today regarding its plans when it releases its Q3 financial report, so we'll be sure to update you on that as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Black Flag Resynced has already been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-has-been-rated-by-pegi">rated by PEGI</a>, while its main star, actor Matt Ryan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-actor-drops-the-biggest-remake-hint-yet">dropped a major hint</a> while speaking with a fan, stating "you may have to beat it again".</p>

Hold up now folks, don't get too excited, sit yourselves down.</p>
<p>As described in the official patch notes (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-today-2-4-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the new widget is a "compact size equivalent to four icons", so it's not going to take up a massive chunk of space on your home screen. Naturally, all you need to do is update the app via the Play Store/App Store, and you'll be good to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added a new size to the calendar widget.<br>
- We’ve added a compact size equivalent to four icons to the daily rotating calendar widgets featuring various characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong>Tomodachi Life</strong> can now be selected as a game series you're interested in. To do this, navigate to your account settings screen on the bottom right, tap on 'Home', then 'Your Favourite Characters/Game Series'.</p>
<p>With the impending release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>, this might be a good way to keep up to date on minor announcements or videos. Of course, we'll be covering any larger announcements right here on Nintendo Life too.</p>

<p>Ranked Battle Season 7 kicks off on <strong>19th February</strong> and will be sticking around until <strong>12th March</strong>. The big reward this time is a Blazikenite Mega Stone — dished out to all those who reach Rank S — which you can use to Mega Evolve your Blaziken.</p>
<p>Once again, Mega Stone rewards from previous seasons will make a return this time around, with Swampertite, Sceptillite, Baxcalibrite, Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite and Greninjite available as rewards from Rank T-Y.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7miuhsk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the exact time that Season 7 will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 10pm (Wed) PST / 11pm (Wed) MST / 12am CST / 1am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 6am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 7am CET / 8am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 5pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As ever, there are some Pokédex restrictions on which 'mon you can take into battle with you in Season 7. Just like last time, only Pokémon numbered 001-232 in the Lumiose 'dex and 001-132 in the Hyperspace 'dex will be allowed to compete, all of which will be set to level 50 for the duration of the battle. Oh yes, and you can only stick one Restricted Legendary Pokémon on your bench, too — so no super teams, okay?</p>
<p>As we say, there are still a few days of Season 6 remaining before all this kicks off. You'll find everything you need to know about the current event (and all those that came before it) in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-battles-all-seasons-and-rewards">Ranked Battle guide</a> below.</p>
