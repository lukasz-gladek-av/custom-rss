<p>Rejoice, Gods and Goddesses! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> launches on Switch and Switch 2 tomorrow, 25th September 2025. Gosh, can time slow down a little bit? There are <em>so many</em> games coming out at the moment.</p>
<p>You'll see reviews have gone live at a number of sites today and might be thinking "wait, where are NL's impressions?" Well, they're coming very soon! So keep an eye out in the coming days.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't quite wait, however, Felix has put together some early impressions of Supergiant Games' first-ever sequel. And, don't worry, if you've never dipped into the Early Access version of the game on Steam, there's no need to fear spoilers, as we're keeping things contained to the early hours.</p>
<p>We've also got some comparisons between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — longer load times and less-crisp visuals, and only 60fps in docked and handheld, while on Switch 2, docked performance is 120fps.</p>

<p>So if you're not sure whether to dive in tomorrow or just want to get a little bit more excited for Hades II, have a look at Felix's video up top. And then check back very soon for our full review.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget, Hades II is getting a full physical edition, and it will have the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions on the cart! If you can't wait, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/heres-when-hades-2-releases-in-your-time-zone">we've got a rundown of when the game drops in your region digitally</a>.</p>

<p>Superdeluxe is back with two more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-castlevania-games-ranked-switch-and-nintendo-consoles">Castlevania</a> releases — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_advance_collection">Advance Collection</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Dominus Collection</a> — and they recently arrived at the Nintendo Life office.</p><div><figure data-videoid="EFjR3Z5CjWQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFjR3Z5CjWQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EFjR3Z5CjWQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFjR3Z5CjWQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed48884dqnrotm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>834k</span></a></p>

<p>The Advance Collection, which includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_circle_of_the_moon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_harmony_of_dissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/castlevania_dracula_x">Castlevania: Dracula X / Vampire's Kiss</a>, contains four art cards, three maps, three soundtrack CDs, a special trading card and a full-colour instruction manual.</p>
<p>The maps are a particular highlight; they're hand-drawn and feature game data on the reverse side.</p>

<p>While it's possible to get these two collections in their standard physical format, these deluxe versions are really quite special, and I imagine most Castlevania fans will want them on their shelves.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-the-latest-previews-are-in-for-pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/round-up-the-latest-previews-are-in-for-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1307166/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It has felt like a long time coming, but we are finally on the home stretch of the run-up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been popping up at a handful of public events over the last month or so to give us all a taste of what the next entry has in store, but we recently got the opportunity to play... more of it.</p>
<p>The lovely Alex-from-Nintendo-Life-here was lucky enough to go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pokemon-legends-z-as-combat-shines-brightly-but-its-visuals-are-still-dull">hands-on</a> with the game for the best part of an hour at a Paris press event, and his thoughts are somewhat mixed. While Mr Olney had a great time getting to grips with the new real-time combat, his optimism was sullied by the rather bland presentation.</p>
<p>You can watch his full thoughts in the video above, but here's a snippet from the written version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It really is baffling and overwhelmingly disappointing that Pokémon games continue to fall short in the looks department, especially when you consider that historically (on handheld devices) they were graphical showcases many moons prior.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188256 @ 1758731434 -->
<p>And yet, we were not the only ones to go hands-on with the game, oh no. Other outlets have also shared their preview thoughts after attending a similar session, so let's try to get an idea of the consensus, shall we?</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-one-hour-with-pokemon-legends-z-a-highlights-big-changes-to-the-series/">VGC</a>. The outlet seemed pretty hot on the game, praising the returning catching mechanics and bold battle swings — even if the latter may be initially difficult for long-time fans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speed with which Pokémon can be caught is as satisfying as it was in the first Legends game, and is as close as the series has come to the idea of being a bug catcher sneaking up on a rare creature, the inspiration for the series as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-essentially-an-action-game-but-might-not-be-a-particularly-great-one">Eurogamer</a> seemed slightly cooler on the new battle system, noting its potential for chaos and frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Pokémon going full real-time action, ultimately, with your character frequently dodge-rolling around the Wild Zone or crouching behind cars in the Z-A Royales, as Pokémon attacks fly. I've nothing against that in principle, much as I love Pokémon's classic, highly tactical turn-based battle system. The only concern is the implementation: this feels, at first pass, like a system retro-fitted onto a series that already has all kinds of baggage, as opposed to proper ground-up reimagining of how Pokémon-on-Pokémon combat might work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/ive-been-playing-pokemon-for-17-years-but-pokemon-legends-z-a-makes-me-feel-like-im-relearning-everything-i-knew-about-battles-in-the-best-way-possible/">GamesRadar</a> had much more fun with these new battle mechanics, believing that Z-A "has what it takes to rejuvenate Game Freak's tried and tested RPG formula":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I have so much to learn about its new combat mechanics, as the experience so far feels like relearning so much of what I knew – <em>especially</em> after seeing just how different certain moves can behave compared to the turn-based games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-the-final-preview">IGN</a> kept the good vibes coming, even if it was in a slightly more sceptical way. The outlet's preview praised the game's Wild Zones and potential depth of battle mechanics, but worried things may become a little repetitive in the long run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legends: Z-A’s gameplay loop is unique, and I’m looking forward to experimenting with and mastering the new, real-time battle system. I appreciate the risks Pokémon is taking here - I just hope they fully pay off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-battles/">Polygon</a> was all about the battle system, praising Z-A's depth and "thrilling" gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a lot of familiarity in sitting down to play <em>Z-A</em> — it’s Pokémon through and through — with just enough of a twist on the traditional formula to feel innovative and original.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a starman</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After being announced just over a week ago <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-brings-ds-rpgs-to-switch-in-2026">during the Japanese Nintendo Direct broadcast</a>, Capcom has shared an updated trailer and a few new details about the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer was shown during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rD0i4pOTk">Capcom's TGS 2025 Online Program</a> and, as you'd expect from this compilation of DS RPGs, the team has introduced a couple of new features to help modernise the experience and provide a package that loyal fans will love.</p>
<p>These include a toggleable high-resolution filter, an in-game gallery featuring over 1000 pieces of art, a music player — plus "new versions of favourite tracks" — and difficulty and assist settings, which look to include different screen settings, similar to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> from Konami and M2.</p>
<p>Plus, in another win for fans, cards that were exclusive to special events and toys will be available in-game. So this is the complete experience for the entire series.</p>

<p>The latest Mega Man collection is due to drop on Switch in 2026, so we'll bring you that release date as soon as we know!</p>
