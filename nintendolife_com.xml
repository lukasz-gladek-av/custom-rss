<p>"The first CoD Switch version is nearly done"</p>

<figure data-uuid="8b372b96a42be"><a title="Call of Duty Warzone" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b372b96a42be/call-of-duty-warzone.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following a rumour last week about Bethesda's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield">Starfield</a> coming to the Switch 2 next year, there's now been a supposed update about the Nintendo version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>According to Windows Central executive editor Jez Corden, the "first" Call of Duty Switch release is "nearly done" and could be launching in just a matter of months. He goes on to mention how it's definitely "on the way" and has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530">apparently been "hitting milestones"</a>, so a 2026 release window looks like a possibility.</p>

<p>Our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/rumour-xbox-nearly-done-with-first-version-of-call-of-duty-for-nintendo-switch"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a> have shared their thoughts about what this release might even be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're going to guess this probably relates to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_warzone_2_0">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> — the ever-evolving free-to-play experience — rather than a port of Black Ops 7 that may get in the way of a potential Call of Duty mainline release in late 2026."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdspglhz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms">original 10-year deal</a> was made to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms, there have been multiple reports about how it's still on the way. Most recently, in November, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/call-of-duty-dev-sledgehammer-games-seeking-talent-with-switch-experience">Call of Duty job applications</a> seeking "Switch experience" were discovered.</p>
<p>Activision also shared an update earlier this month about the Call of Duty series "going forward", mentioning how its development and release strategy was changing. This followed on from a negative fan reception to the latest outing, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, this follows the news last week from the same source, claiming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/rumour-bethesdas-newest-ip-is-still-reportedly-on-course-for-switch-2">Starfield will land on the Switch 2</a> at some point next year.</p>

<p>Nintendo is feeling jolly</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="174d817ba24e2"><a title="Nintendo Switch Online" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/174d817ba24e2/nintendo-switch-online.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the Switch 2 was announced, many Nintendo fans were already calling for themes to be added to the HOME Menu.</p>
<p>While there have been no developments on this front, there is something else that at least <em>some</em> fans are excited about. From the system HOME Menu, if you navigate to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' icon, you'll be presented with a "Happy Holidays" theme featuring Mario and the rest of the crew.</p>
<p>This limited-time theme has even got its own music, and when you flick through the menu, a jingle sound effect plays.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nyulqk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The music appears to be 'Snowball Park' from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and there's also a small easter egg. If you <a href="https://x.com/DeboReynoldsJr/status/2001893719860293660">navigate to the bottom of the menu</a> and keep pushing the analogue stick down, you'll see some Mario-themed characters and a "Happy Holidays" message pop up.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we've seen themes added to <em>other</em> sections of Switch systems before, and it probably won't be the last.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo is also offering special holiday-themed Switch Online icons. You can get these icons for 10 Platinum Points each, and borders and backgrounds will set you back 5 Platinum Points each.</p>

<p>But you can keep it anyway</p>

<figure data-uuid="ddc17bf70fdbe"><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ddc17bf70fdbe/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: CD PROJEKT RED</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> for the Switch 2 was spotted going for <strong>75% off</strong> its regular price in the US, reducing it from $69.99 down to just <strong>$17.49</strong>.</p>
<p>Fans were convinced it was an error, and now, sure enough, <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/2003602413702512780">CD Project Red has confirmed</a> the price displayed on the Switch 2 digital store "in the Americas on December 22, 2025" was "incorrect". It seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</a> for Switch was also accidentally discounted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, CDPR is in a festive mood, and if you did manage to purchase either of these games at the discounted prices, you'll be able to keep them. Here's the official notice about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CD PROJEKT RED:</strong> The discounts for Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition displayed on Nintendo Switch 2 eShop in the Americas on December 22, 2025 were incorrect.</p>
<p>The situation is a result of an error we made when submitting the discount. We have corrected the error and new discounts have now been applied.</p>
<p>Purchases made at the previous discount rate are unaffected by this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there have been "new discounts" applied to the titles in the Americas. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is currently available for <strong>$39.99</strong> instead of $69.99 (that's <strong>42% off</strong>), and the Witcher 3 Complete Edition on Switch is now priced at <strong>$14.99</strong> instead of $59.99 (<strong>75% off</strong>).</p>
<p>The Ultimate Edition of Cyberpunk 2077 includes not only the base game, but also the DLC expansion <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Phantom Liberty</a></strong>. And the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 comes loaded with Geralt's original adventure and the two expansions.</p>
