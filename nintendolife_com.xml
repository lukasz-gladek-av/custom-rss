<p>Coming to Switch consoles this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Wishfully Studios' sublime debut, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a>, brought some top-notch puzzle/platforming action to Switch back in April 2024. Indeed, we went so far as to give this beautiful-looking cinematic adventure a rather splendid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">8/10 back at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Now, its Swedish dev, alongside publisher Thunderful Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/atari-to-acquire-steamworld-dev-thunderful">now majority owned by Atari</a>), has dropped a full 10 minutes of unedited gameplay footage from the game's soon-to-be-released sequel, the cunningly titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf</a>. Oh yes.</p>
<p>You can check out the video above, and we've got to say, rather unsurprisingly, it's looking like something we'll want to be playing as soon as it drops, on both Switch consoles, <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>. Keeping its predecessor's stylish sci-fi tone, the trailer shows off a game that will surely look fantastic in handheld mode on either Switch.</p>

<p>The original Planet of Lana made amazingly good use of its sci-fi setting and its gorgeous art-stylings to hammer home an emotional, absorbing and otherworldly tale, which also has its fair share of very good puzzles and platforming to keep you busy.</p>
<p>You know the score if you've played cinematic games of this ilk before, your <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ico">Icos</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Insides</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/another_world">Another Worlds</a>. Lots of running in fabulously animated fashion, basically, whilst avoiding death and making peace with the fact you have little in the way of defence. Relaxing!</p>

<figure data-uuid="45e7a612de2e9"><a title="Nintendo Today!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45e7a612de2e9/nintendo-today.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has updated its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app for Android and iOS, boosting its reach with additional releases in four countries (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-today-updated-to-version-2-3-0-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>As detailed in the (very brief) patch notes, the app is now live in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Today! - Version 2.3.0 Update</strong></p>
<p>Now available in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've yet to experience the delights of the Nintendo Today! app, it's essentially Nintendo's primary way of communicating key announcements and updates since its launch in 2025. You'll often find that new trailers or even Nintendo Direct announcements will be made on the app before they go live on social media or YouTube.</p>
<p>One such announcement was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, the single-player spin-off title for the <strong>Splatoon</strong> series on Switch 2. A debut trailer was released on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">10th June 2025</a>, but we've yet to hear anything more about this mysterious title. Here's hoping Nintendo will host a fresh Direct soon and reveal its secrets.</p>

<p>Realising the "simple concept" with limited resources wasn't easy</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8031ea1de504b"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8031ea1de504b/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> has become a global powerhouse over the past 30 years, the series' beginnings didn't necessarily happen overnight.</p>
<p>In a special video message during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> recently (where Pokémon received the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">prestigious 'Andrew Yoon Legend Award'</a> for industry impact), The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara reflected on the origins of the series and the challenges the team faced during the development of the original Pokémon games.</p>
<p>These Game Boy titles started as a "simple concept" where players would be able to catch creatures and trade them with friends. However, making this come to life wasn't exactly easy with such "limited resources" and it actually required a lot of "trial and error" over a six-year time frame, according to Ishihara, who worked as a producer on these titles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tsunekazu Ishihara</strong><strong>:</strong> The development process, however, was not quite as easy. It took a great deal of trial and error to figure out how to actulize this idea with the limited resources we had available.</p>
<p>In the end, it took six years to complete the first games, Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green.</p>
<p>Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team believed this formula would work because the elements were tied to "fundamental experiences" everyone had as children when they were out catching bugs, growing plants and raising animals.</p>
<p>Ishihara also admits he was "uncertain at first" about the game being able to appeal to people overseas, but he realises now it's been able to transcend language, cultural barriers and truly has the "power to connect the world". He adds how he's using this as a "major driving force" when it comes to producing the next game, and how to make it "more enjoyable for everyone".</p>
<p>Pokémon will celebrate its 30th anniversary next month on Pokémon Day, which takes place on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

Although fans were informed the team would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/kirby-air-riders-dev-team-disbanding-soon-game-updates-also-ending">disbanding soon</a>, game director and video game legend Masahiro Sakurai mentioned in December how there might be one more round of adjustments.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Japanese customer support page on social media has now revealed new update data for Kirby Air Riders will be arriving soon. As for what riders can expect, there'll apparently be various bug fixes and balance adjustments.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8advkjtoz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As usual, the latest updates for the game are not compatible with past replays, so be sure to save replay data before downloading this latest patch. Here's a rough translation detailing this next update, and official patch notes will follow when the update goes live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We plan to release update data for "Kirby's Air Rider" soon. This update data will include bug fixes and balance adjustments. After the update, it will no longer be compatible with replays of the update data Ver. 1.2.0 or earlier, so you will not be able to play replays that have already been saved in "Temporary Saved Data" or "Replay with Data" in "Replay". If you have a replay that you want to keep, please "record" on the playback settings screen of "Temporary Save Data" or "Replay with Data" before downloading the update data, and convert it to a video file. *A microSD Express card is required to use this function."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this might be one of the last significant updates for Kirby Air Riders, the in-game events have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/kirby-air-riders-in-game-events-are-planned-to-run-for-a-year-after-launch">scheduled to run for a "year after launch"</a>.

</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fd6f39dd87feb"><a title="Sonic Boom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd6f39dd87feb/sonic-boom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>There have already been multiple layoffs and closures in the opening weeks of 2026, and in case you missed it, Meta (formerly Facebook) last week announced the closure of three studios. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/armature-studio-founded-by-metroid-prime-devs-has-been-shut-down">Apart from Armature</a>, one of these developers was Sanzaru Games, which was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/facebook-acquires-sanzaru-games">acquired by Meta in 2020</a> and had been working under Oculus Studios in its Reality Labs division.</p>
<p>If the name doesn't ring a bell, the California-based team was one of the developers who worked on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/sonic_boom_rise_of_lyric">Sonic Boom</a> games. This includes the 3DS titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_boom_shattered_crystal">Shattered Crystal</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_boom_fire_and_ice">Fire &amp; Ice</a>. Before working on these particular games, it had helped out with multiple <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/sly_collection"><strong>Sly Cooper</strong></a> titles, and was founded in 2006 by former Activision developers.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-begins-jobs-cuts-after-shifting-focus-from-metaverse-to-phones?srnd=undefined">reported by Bloomberg</a>, this closure is part of Meta's plans to cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs business, which was working on Oculus VR hardware and software. Twisted Pixel (located in Texas and known for games such as <strong>The Maw</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ms_splosion_man">Ms Splosion Man</a> and <strong>Marvel's Deadpool VR</strong>) was also impacted.</p>
<p>Sonic Boom was a spin-off of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series. It also included an animated television series, comic series and toy line. Back in 2020, Sonic fans actually got an update about the show, with the executive producer Bill Freiberger mentioning at the time how it wouldn't be making a comeback.</p>
<p>In more recent years, Sanzaru worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spyro_reignited_trilogy">Spyro Reignited Trilogy (Year of the Dragon)</a> and until its closure had been developing new VR titles.</p>
