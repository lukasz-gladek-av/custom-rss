<p>The update packs in all the stuff you'd expect to find in a Switch 2 patch, promising improved frame rate and resolution, <em>and</em> upgrades to the shadow quality and anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>We don't have any specifics on what any of the above look like in their improved state (here's hoping for 60fps), but we'll always welcome news of things moving in the right direction.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tuxhym&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>In its initial form, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ark_survival_evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> was a bit of a mess on the Switch. The port was marred by technical issues, making the whole thing feel a little <em>too</em> ambitious for Nintendo's humble console. By all accounts, things started to turn around in the later 'Ultimate Survivor Edition' (it popped up in one of our earlier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">Games We Missed</a> community features), so here's hoping that today's Switch 2 update keeps things on the up and up.</p>

<p>Needs a little more time in the cauldron</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It feels like we have been waiting for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a> for ages, and today, Chucklefish has announced that we'll be staying this way for a while longer, as the game has been delayed until <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Shared in a development update on the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">Witchbrook website</a>, the studio thanked fans for their continued "patience, passion and continued support" as it announced that it was taking the extra time to make sure the world of Mossport felt <em>just right</em>, while also getting the chance to add "exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support".</p>
<p>Here's a snippet of the dev announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/devblog-simulation/"><em>first blog</em></a>, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always a shame to hear of a game delay, though given that the release window was originally billed for 'Winter 2025', it's hardly the end of the world. In a note on the game's <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/#FAQ">FAQ page</a>, Chucklefish states that it is "proud to be a zero-crunch studio," reaffirming that "we truly believe that developers who are healthy and well-rested make better games". Honestly, it's hard to disagree with that.</p>
<p>It's not all bad news, mind you, as the update also saw the reveal of the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">Mossport interactive map</a>, which showcases just how big this magical world is — spoiler: it's pretty big.</p>
<p>We're still lacking the specifics on that 2026 date at the moment, but the game's delightful pixel art, witch-y aesthetics and all-around cosiness leave us happy to wait for as long as it needs.</p>
