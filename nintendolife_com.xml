<p>Rumours have been rumbling about Valve — the Washington-based developer responsible for creating Steam, but for also bringing us some of the best games ever made such as <strong>Half-Life</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a>, and <strong>Counter Strike</strong> — announcing some brand new hardware for a few days now.</p>
<p>And earlier today, multiple press outlets have revealed they've gone hands-on with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/hardware">three new pieces of Steam-compatible kit</a>: a brand new controller, a "streaming-first" headset, and what is basically a game console. The Steam Controller, Steam Frame, and Steam Machine, to give them their proper names.</p>
<p>And while the controller and headset look cool, the Steam Machine is the one that's caught most people's eyes, and for good reason: it looks an awful lot like a GameCube, doesn't it?</p>
<p>The resemblance is pretty striking. The Steam Machine is just a little black cube, measuring at approximately 6-inches, just a little bigger than our favourite purple 'Cube from the 00s, which comes in at 5.9 × 6.3 × 4.3 inches (sans the Game Boy Player, though the Steam Machine looks like it <em>basically</em> has one of those).</p>

<p>We're not the only people to make the comparison either; "It's not an Xbox, it's not a GameCube" Game File's Stephen Totilo posted on Bluesky shortly after the Machine's reveal. The Verge's Tom Warren opted to give it the cheeky nickname the "<a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1988671431211905535">GabeCube</a>".</p>
<p>Still, it <em>is</em> missing a handle, but it does have a customisable face plate. Not quite the same as the little GameCube logo on top of the console, but similar enough. It's sleek, small, and we're a little envious.</p>

<p>Our friends over at Digital Foundry have <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/hands-on-with-steam-machine-valves-new-pcconsole-hybrid">an excellent run-down of the new console</a> (alongside the other two peripherals) if you want more details.</p>
<p>Prices will be revealed at a later date, but the console is due to arrive in early 2026. Oh, but if Valve doesn't release a handle within a few months of the Steam Machine's release, well, they've missed a trick, we reckon.</p>
<p>But it's good to see the old cubic design back in full force. The GameCube <em>truly</em> is perfect, design wise, isn't it?</p>
