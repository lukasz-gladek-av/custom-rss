<figure><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0cf0e382505e/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A recent online post from the US Department of Homeland Security has prompted calls from angry fans for The Pokémon Company to initiate legal action against the US federal department.</p>
<p>If you've somehow missed it, the post — <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530">entitled 'Gotta Catch 'Em All'</a> — contains a video mixing the Pokémon anime's famous intro with footage of law enforcement agents handcuffing and detaining people.</p>
<p>The use of the Pokémon IP to promote the wave of recent, controversial arrests by ICE agents in the US has some fans calling on the IP owners to take legal action, with replies <a href="https://x.com/LordFemto725/status/1970703790773813509">tagging official accounts</a> on X and <a href="https://x.com/Melb0urne__82/status/1970354243941867594">referencing Nintendo's notoriety</a> as a litigious company protective of its brands.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fziqmjg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">speaking with IGN</a>, The Pokémon Company's former Chief Legal Officer Don McGowan says that he believes a lawsuit is unlikely, mentioning specifically the green-card status of many of TPC's executives in the US and a general aversion to publicity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't see them doing anything about this for a few reasons. First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p>
<p>"Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referencing Pokémon's famous catch phrase, the minute-long video plays the theme tune to the '90s anime in its entirety, cutting between clips from the intro featuring Ash Ketchum and footage of doors being blown open with explosives.</p>
<p>'Department of Homeland Security' appears in a font similar to the Pokémon logo, followed by blurred footage of Border Patrol agents detaining people. A number of Pokémon TCG-style card mock-ups are shown at the end, displaying convicted individuals with a weakness to Ice-type.</p></section>

<p>Experience a brand-new tale in Dark Ties</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega isn't slowing down any time soon when it comes to the Yakuza series, and with this in mind, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has today announced it's bringing <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a></strong> to the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms next year.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://youtu.be/7VZM3ysP4vg">RGG Summit 2025</a>, the talented studio confirmed this particular entry would be arriving on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>, with <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties">digital pre-orders going live today</a> and physical version pre-orders to follow in the "coming days".</p>
<p>As mentioned in the official game description, the third entry originally made its debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009, and it's now been "reimagined with cutting-edge visuals and modern technology". It also comes with the brand-new tale, Dark Ties. Here are some more details about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally debuting on PlayStation 3 in 2009, <strong>Yakuza 3</strong> has been reimagined with cutting-edge visuals and modern technology. This evolved edition brings Okinawa to life, featuring more intense battles, added cutscenes that bring depth to the story, and minigames chock-full of replay value. Kiryu's back in the brawl, continuing the fight to protect those he holds dear.</p>
<p>This title also includes <strong>Dark Ties</strong>, which stars Yoshitaka Mine, Kiryu's adversary. Follow Mine on his journey from working as a venture company's founder to becoming a full-fledged yakuza member. After losing everything, Mine sets off in an attempt to form a connection that would fill the void in his heart. Kazuma Kiryu and Yoshitaka Mine live in different ways.</p>
<p>Walk alongside them as their paths intersect, throwing both of their fates in the balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> game announcement follows the release of Yakuza Kiwami on the Switch eShop last October.</p>
<p>Since then, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> has been released on Switch 2, and this will be followed by Yakuza Kiwami and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> for the Switch 2 this November. It's also been confirmed Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 for the Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1970714949006827656">are getting separate physical releases</a>, but they're both Game-Key Cards.</p>
