<figure data-uuid="6b0e11a69370e"><a title="SNES Classic Mini - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b0e11a69370e/snes-classic-mini-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl!</p>
<p>Last time, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/inazuma_eleven">Inazuma Eleven</a> for the DS, which resulted in a heated battle in which Europe emerged triumphant against Japan with 71% of the vote. Well done!</p>
<p>This time, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the SNES, we thought we'd check out the box designs for the SNES Classic Mini, released in September 2017. Continuing the trend set by the NES Classic Mini, this was an adorable homage to the original SNES and came loaded with a bunch of pre-installed games, many of which can be considered all-time greats.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt23DYpTkUosk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63enshioy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Considering the actual design of the console itself differs depending on the region, the box art designs here are wildly different, so it'll be interesting to see how this one pans out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:71679 @ 1763899784 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="99e86f7f1c916"><a title="SNES NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99e86f7f1c916/snes-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so the North American design is pretty busy, right? We've got an image of the console and controllers in the centre, six games listed over on the right (including the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox_2">Star Fox 2</a>), and the main logo over on the bottom.</p>
<p>We love the colour scheme here; the blacks and reds work really well, and it gives the box a slightly more 'mature' aesthetic.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4a2b9c4d78491"><a title="SNES EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a2b9c4d78491/snes-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe's approach is similar, but also... not. We've still got the black/red colour scheme, but there are no specific games listed on the front. Instead, we've got a small bit of key art from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> in the bottom right. Minimal, but effective.</p>
<p>What on earth is going on with the age ratings, though? Why are they so big?! Ew, no... Not for us.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="54c3c84695362"><a title="SNES JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54c3c84695362/snes-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oooooh. Ooooooh. Okay, we're trying not to be biased, but <em>oooooooooh</em>.</p>
<p>This one is really nice. If North America and Europe's designs can be called cluttered, this is the absolute opposite. Instead, we've got a minimal approach that swaps out the black colour scheme for white, while the outlines depicting the console and controllers add a lovely bit of colour.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-snes-classic-mini-console]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We sincerely apologize to everyone waiting"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive- Nintendo Switch Edition</a> arrived earlier this year in January, but fans on the hybrid platform were left behind when the new DLC and other updates never showed up.</p>
<p>Now, alongside an apology about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/guilty-gear-switch-edition-update-and-dlc-arriving-fall-2025">missing the previous window</a>, Arc System Works has confirmed the Season 4 "DLC characters" and "implementation of ranked matches" will be arriving in the Switch version of the game on <strong>18th December 2025</strong>. As a reminder, these characters include Venom, Unika and Lucy from the anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Here's part of the translated message about the update and DLC delay on Switch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had initially announced that the game would be released in the fall of 2025, but due to additional issues arising during the operational testing process, we have changed the release date. We sincerely apologize to everyone who has been eagerly awaiting the update for any inconvenience caused. The development team is making every effort to ensure a high level of perfection so as not to impair the gaming experience of our users.</p>
<p>We hope you continue to enjoy GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the Switch version of Guilty Gear Strive includes 28 playable characters in the base package, including the first three seasons of the title.</p>

<p>Update: It will be available for all platforms</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2d35179740329"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d35179740329/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-11-23T09:00:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 23rd Nov 2025, 9am</time>]:</strong> It seems we might have got to the bottom of this mystery. According to multiple online listings, Capcom will offer "Lenticular Editions" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> for all platforms. So, not just for the Switch 2 but also the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game.</p>
<p>Some listings describe this as being a "case sleeve" or "card" (featuring what is basically a changing picture, depending on the angle you view it from). This same type of card has also recently been featured in official Capcom advertising materials for the 'Deluxe Edition' of the game.</p>
<p>Some online listings outside of the US also show the Switch 2 game case with cover art matching its PS5 and Xbox counterparts. So, there you go - it seems there might not be special treatment for the Switch 2 version in this department.</p>

<p>If we hear any updates or developments, we'll let you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> When the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> arrives next February, Nintendo fans can look forward to a few extra goodies, such as a limited edition Pro Controller and eventually a themed amiibo.</p>
<p>As highlighted by many Nintendo enthusiasts online, it seems there could be another surprise. If you haven't already seen the title's cover art for the Switch 2 standard physical release, it's <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-a-different-boxart-on-nintendo-switch-2/">apparently looking a bit "different"</a> from the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the cover art on display for the Nintendo release features the game's protagonist, and FBI intelligence analyst, Grace Ashcroft.</p>

<p>As Nintendo Everything highlights, although the standard release may show different cover art here for Switch 2 physical copies, it seems Capcom has shown the same design for the Deluxe Edition of the game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="365ac63fab41d"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/365ac63fab41d/resident-evil-requiem.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>This cover on display here for the Switch 2 standard version has resulted in all sorts of speculation online, so if we find out anything else, we'll let you know. On Switch 2, Resident Evil Requiem is expected to offer the same gameplay experience as other platforms and will also be releasing at the same time on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It's also been previously confirmed the physical Switch 2 version is a Game-Key Card. Capcom will be offering a special '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed"><strong>Generation Pack</strong></a>' as well containing the new game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> (launching for Switch 2 on the same date).</p>

<p>Say goodbye to Godzilla and Hatsune Miku</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a> was released on the Switch last June, and Sega followed it up with a bunch of DLC updates.</p>
<p>This included Godzilla and Hatsune Miku, who joined the roster on 26th November 2024. Now, a year later, Sega's Japanese <a href="https://x.com/SMB_JP/status/1990978490007761381?s=20">Super Monkey Ball social media account</a> has announced these same licensed characters will be delisted on <strong>26th November 2025</strong> (aka next week).</p>
<p>Here's a rough machine translation about the removal of the cheerful virtual singer and the king of the monsters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hatsune Miku and Godzilla - playable character available until next week, November 26th (Wednesday) Everyone hurry up"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no local update about these characters (or other characters) being delisted at the time of writing, but if you were planning on getting any of the DLC for this title, you might want to grab it while it's still available.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time this has happened, with the 2021 Switch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_mania">Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</a> also delisting DLC such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a> character Morgana.</p>
