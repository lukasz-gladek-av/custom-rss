<p>Attack Vector and Sleeper Case get a facelift</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Genki Sleeper Case / Attack Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/907ba70c1f128/genki-sleeper-case-attack-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The relationship between Genki and Switch 2 might forever be defined by that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">pre-reveal CES showcase</a>, but the accessory manufacturer has produced a lot of gear for the new hybrid in the months since. While we have liked most of the Switch 2 accessories we've seen so far from the company, select items have not been without their issues, with early teething problems like tricky zippers and too-snug designs. Fortunately, the problematic products have now received an upgrade.</p>
<p>Genki has informed us that both the Attack Vector modular case and the Sleeper Case are now available without any of the issues that both came with at launch. Previously, several users reported that the Attack Vector was too tight in the Switch 2 Dock, making it difficult to play the console up on the big screen, while many found the Sleeper Case's zip to be too tough.</p>
<p>We similarly took issue with the Sleeper Case's zipper in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">our review</a>, and while we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">didn't have any docking issues with the Attack Vector</a>, it's still nice to hear that the accessory manufacturer is listening to its customers.</p>
<p>Both items are now available on the Genki website in their new and improved forms — the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">Attack Vector</a> will set you back <strong>£42/$49.99</strong>, while the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Sleeper Case</a> is listed for <strong>£36/$42.99</strong>. These two items accompany the rest of Genki's Switch 2 lineup, including screen protectors, a charging base and more.</p>

<p>Although these teething problems appear to be on the mend, Genki isn't out of the woods yet. Following the company's much-discussed CES presentation back in January (where Switch 2 prototypes were freely shown off, despite Nintendo not yet officially lifting the lid on the system), Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-company-that-leaked-switch-2-is-being-sued-by-nintendo">opened a lawsuit</a> against the company, claiming that Genki "demoed and promoted unauthorized purported mockups and renderings of the Nintendo Switch 2 and its accessories".</p>
<p>Genki has since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/accessory-manufacturer-genki-responds-to-nintendos-switch-2-lawsuit">released a statement</a>, claiming that it is "taking [Nintendo's case] seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully," and promised that it will "share more when we can".</p>

<p>And it looks terrible</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Palland 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b14bc65cf2564/palland-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: BoggySoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developer Pocketpair is still very much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/palworld-dev-announces-disappointing-game-changes-resulting-from-nintendos-lawsuit">in the midst of a lawsuit</a> from Nintendo over its smash-hit title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/palworld">Palworld</a>, but it may have another issue on its hands.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/palworld-ripoff-palland-on-nintendo-switch/">The Gamer</a>, a new title by the name of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/palland">Palland</a> is now available via the Switch eShop, and everything from its basic description to its screenshots indicate that it's a blatant rip-off of Palworld. Does that also make it a rip-off of <strong>Pokémon</strong>..? Well, Nintendo would probably say so, yes. We're not so sure about Pocketpair.</p>
<p>Developed by BoggySoft (lovely), Palland was released on <strong>31st July 2025</strong> yet has already been heavily discounted by 60% to a paltry <strong>£3.99 / $5.99</strong>. Just goes to show how much faith BoggySoft has in its product, huh?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lknjsw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We should also point out that the screenshots included on the eShop page (which you can view below) don't appear to be indicative of the actual experience. If you check out gameplay videos on YouTube from channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UebFsxkHwM">Nintendo Hall</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW4CCT5C7hQ">Game Buoy Games</a>, you can see that the visuals aren't even remotely comparable. Where's all the grass?! It's almost on par with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>, for goodness' sake (<em>joking</em> - gosh).</p>
<p>Anyway, it's interesting (and funny) that the game responsible for Nintendo's recent lawsuit against Pocketpair now has its own rip-off – on the Switch, no less! Guffaw.</p>

<p>We're fascinated to see whether Pocketpair takes any action against BoggySoft and Palland while it's still knee-deep in its own legal battle against Nintendo. Chances are it probably won't, but who knows.</p>
