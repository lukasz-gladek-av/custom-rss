<p>New features also get a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As we approach the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, The Pokémon Company has lifted the lid on a brand new expansion that will be arriving in the app next week.</p>
<p>The "Mega Rising' expansion bursts onto the scene one week today, on <strong>30th October</strong>, and, as the name suggests, it'll bring a Mega Evolution twist to proceedings. Mega Gyarados, Mega Blaziken and Mega Altaria take to the covers of this new set, and all users will receive one of each on launch day <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>That's to celebrate the app's one-year anniversary, for which TPC has announced new Special Missions, and reissued Special Drop and Wonder Pick events. The "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">New and Updated</a>" app features that were teased earlier this month will also arrive on 30th October, so keep an eye out for improved Wonder Picks, a new share feature, and an expanded number of tradable cards.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at some of the chase cards from the new expansion:</p>


<p>While this writer wishes the new releases would slow down a little, we can't imagine that it'll happen any time soon. The Pokémon Company today announced that the app has surpassed 150 million downloads in its first year, which is a <em>crazy</em> number when you think about it. Expect the new expansions to keep on rolling out, we guess.</p>

<p>Sneaky...</p>

<p>Nintendo and Ubisoft have finally confirmed the world's worst-kept secret: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is launching on the Switch 2 on 2nd December 2025. Darn, that is a <em>packed</em> first week of the last month of 2025, isn't it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Rumours have</a> been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-may-clash-with-metroid-prime-4">swirling about</a> this one for a few weeks now, but the announcement confirms a couple of rather lovely features. It'll cost <strong>USD</strong> <strong>$59.99</strong> and will be available on the eShop or as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>First up, cross-progression is available as long as you have an Ubisoft Connect account! So if you've been playing on another console up until now and want to swap to the hybrid system for the holiday season, you won't lose your progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, here's something we didn't expect: touchscreen support. All the in-game menus will allow you to use the touchscreen when playing in handheld mode. That includes the world map, too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">a blog post</a>, Ubisoft has also detailed Title Updates 10 and 11 for the game. Those updates will be available on the Switch 2 version from release, and these bring Corrupted Castles, parkour updates, new free story updates, and new environmental puzzles. Note that the Claws of Awaji expansion won't be available until early 2026.</p>
<p>For those who missed it earlier in the year, Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on other consoles on 20th March 2025. Taking the series to Feudal Japan, you play as both the shinobi Naoe or the samurai Yasuke, both of whom play very differently. Naoe feels like your more traditional series protagonist, focusing on stealthy gameplay, while Yasuke is much more direct in combat.</p>
<p>Our sister site Push Square were fans upon its original release, awarding the game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows">an 8/10</a>, concluding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Assassin's Creed Shadows is unlikely to win over those who struggled to push through Odyssey or Valhalla, this is still one of the strongest overall entries in the series — and arguably the best of the open world RPG bunch."</p>
</blockquote>
