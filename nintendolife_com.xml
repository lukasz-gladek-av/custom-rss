<p>"I won't look anymore!"</p>

<figure data-uuid="142703ed0cc7e"><a title="Miyamoto" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/142703ed0cc7e/miyamoto.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApUMBscKOc">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>It's no secret that Shigeru Miyamoto has taken a bit of a backseat when it comes to game development. The last Mario game he personally oversaw as director was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and after his most recent experience as general producer on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>, the creator has largely shifted over to the world of movies.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://casabrutus.com/magazines/issue/no308">Casa Brutus</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-going-to-be-fun-miyamoto-discusses-mario-galaxy-movie-and-the-future-of-mario-games/">VGC</a>), Miyamoto hints toward taking even further steps away from game development. He states that while Nintendo currently has other developers leading the charge on new Mario titles, he nevertheless endeavours to play them and deliver feedback on the overall interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nowadays, I have teammates who help maintain the world of Mario, so I entrust much of it to them. Even so, I always personally play through about the first 30 minutes of the game and check the interface thoroughly — to make sure it really feels like Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then – perhaps jokingly – hints that he may not even do this in the future and simply leave everything to his colleagues, before expressing his wish to remain healthy until Mario's inevitable 50th anniversary in ten years' time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Up through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, I feel we’ve done just about everything we could on the Switch. In the past, whenever a new console came out, we always released a new Mario game, so I do wonder how the current team will take on that challenge.</p>
<p>“But maybe I’ll say, ‘I won’t look anymore!’ (laughs) I just hope to stay healthy until Mario’s 50th anniversary!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussion also turns to the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, which Miyamoto states is in the "final stages of production" while expressing the opinion that "it’s going to be fun". Only time will tell, but the movie's introduction of Yoshi was recently revealed prematurely thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a product listing from none other than US baking firm Pillsbury</a>.</p>
<p>The movie officially launches on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, and it's said that a trailer will debut later this month and play before screenings for <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>.</p>

<p>Find out if the Switch game you want to play is compatible</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="05bd7684ae54f"><a title="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/05bd7684ae54f/super-smash-bros-ultimate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has released game upgrades, updates, and system firmware patches to make more games compatible with its new hybrid system.</p>
<p>It's not always been the easiest to keep track of every update, and to help make this process a little easier, a new website has now gone live.</p>
<p>It allows you to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Nintendo Switch 2. It's as simple as <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">typing a Switch game into the search bar</a>, and it will reveal if it's "supported" or not. Nintendo also notes how search results include both physical and digital versions of software.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iugwyt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>This search functionality extends to apps, and each search may or may not include additional information such as recent patches. Other searches will result in "incompatible" or "unsupported" as you can see in the screenshots below - with Nintendo even acknowledging specific issues.</p>
<p>So, instead of having to refer to the official PDFs or other search methods on Nintendo's website, you can now simply enter the game title in the search bar and find out if the software you want to play is compatible on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>When Nintendo initially revealed Switch game compatibility for the Switch 2, it mentioned at the time how not every game would be supported at launch, but explained how the work to make more games compatible was ongoing.</p>
<p>This new search page means you can now regularly check the status of games that may not yet be compatible with the Switch 2 and see if there are any updates.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ff15af76a3a5b"><a title="Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ff15af76a3a5b/mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> officially launches on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, and Nintendo will be keen to ensure its marketing is on top form for the upcoming sequel. This will no doubt include keeping certain characters under wraps until the opportune moment.</p>
<p>Well... sadly, it seems someone's let the cat out of the bag a little bit too soon... or should that be the Yoshi out of the bag?</p>
<p>Yes, over on the <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">Tops Markets</a> website, the US baking company Pillsbury has uploaded a new product that blatantly shows two images of Yoshi from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. One shows the character taking centre stage on the front of the package with Mario himself striking his best 'Galaxy pose' in the background.</p>
<p>The other is on the back, showing Mario atop Yoshi's back as they soar through space. We also get a glimpse at some of the potential planets from the movie along with what we're assuming is a loose take on Rosalina's Observatory. And is that... Bowser Jr..? Yes, yes it is.</p>
<p>You can check out the images in the embed below, or head on over to the Tops Market website for a look at the original uploads in more detail.</p>

<p>Of course, these new images also corroborate an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">earlier leak from 'Old Spice'</a>, which showcased a similar image of Yoshi alongside a separate product featuring Luigi. This was back in September just prior to the official teaser trailer from Nintendo itself.</p>
<p>It's also been claimed that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/a-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-will-debut-this-month-its-claimed">trailer for the new movie will be broadcast this month</a> ahead of <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>, with speculation pointing to a potential Direct presentation either on or before 21st November 2025.</p>
<p>If this is indeed the case, then we reckon it's a pretty safe bet to say that Yoshi will show up in some capacity.</p>
