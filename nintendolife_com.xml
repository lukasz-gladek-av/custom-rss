<figure data-uuid="e0fbf79984e66"><a title="Bellabel Park 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0fbf79984e66/bellabel-park-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> launched in 2023, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Finally, after a deluge of perfectly serviceable yet uninspiring ‘<strong>New</strong>’ entries, it felt like 2D Mario had gotten its mojo back. Fast-forward to 2026 and Wonder is making its grand return with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> on <strong>26th March</strong>, but after recently going hands-on with the multiplayer segment, I have to admit that it’s yet to conjure up any excitement within me.</p>
<p>I should caveat this immediately by clarifying that I’m not the biggest fan of multiplayer games in the first place. I’m at my happiest when I’m able to just block out the real world and get lost in a game with no outside distractions, so do keep that in mind when reading my thoughts. If you <em>are</em> partial to some multiplayer mayhem, then you may well feel that the ‘Meetup at Bellabel Park’ additions are worth it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2eb2168b1edbf"><a title="Bellabel Park 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2eb2168b1edbf/bellabel-park-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My session consisted of one co-op mode and three PvP modes (or 'attractions', as the game calls them). The first makes use of the Switch 2’s Mouse Mode, with two players directly controlling characters, and two more creating Donut Blocks on the fly to allow passage across wide gaps and directly manipulate the trajectory of enemy attacks. It was… fine. It kind of hints towards some of the potential for a <strong>Mario Maker</strong> game that utilises mouse controls, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>In practice, having two players create Donut Blocks at the same time makes for a pretty messy, confusing experience, since you’re constantly at odds with one another regarding where to actually place the blocks. In addition, if you accidentally move vertically when placing your blocks, you might find yourself completely blocking the way forward for your player-controlled companions. In this instance, you’ll need to make some more blocks in a random corner of the screen in order to cause your previous creations to eventually disappear. As I said, it's very messy.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e48af1b58e1e6"><a title="Bellabel Park 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e48af1b58e1e6/bellabel-park-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two of the three PvP modes were racers, with one seeing you speed through the air on a flying vehicle, and the other rolling everybody up into balls and subsequently using physics to bounce you across the map. They last for about a minute at a time, tops, and although there’s a brief thrill in witnessing a photo finish and seeing who comes out on top via the results page, it’s all pretty forgettable stuff. I struggle to imagine many people jumping into these modes more than a handful of times.</p>
<p>And finally, the last PvP mode I played was essentially a game of hide and seek. Three players jump into Lakitu Clouds and fly around. When you press ‘A’, you can make your character invisible, effectively blending your Lakitu Cloud with dozens of others dotted around the screen. The person who’s ‘it’ will then try to find you, shooting out puffs of magic to help reveal your location. If you’re caught, you become ‘it’ – simple. The aim of the game is to remain hidden until the time runs out, so there's a frantic rush within the last 20 seconds or so to stay out of reach.</p>
<p>It’s a laugh, but again, if I mentally take myself away from the highly curated environment in which I tested these modes out, am I really going to bother with these in the comfort of my own home? Honestly, probably not.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2f03af36c9c71"><a title="Bellabel Park 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f03af36c9c71/bellabel-park-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might think differently, but all of the modes felt like minigames you might play in a <strong>Mario Party</strong> title. Taken within that context, they could be a lot of fun, but as standalone games that you have to consciously choose from the Bellabel Park overworld, they lack substance and feel throwaway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task.</p>
<p>There's definitely more to the Switch 2 Edition, including challenges via the Toad Brigade, the return of The Koopalings, an Assist mode — something which should help with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work">an issue I encountered with my daughter</a> in the base game — and of course, playable Rosalina. Though whether these features warrant an upgrade remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also had a chance to briefly check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR4W3e-_3zs">Talking Flower</a>, uh... toy? Yeah, let's go with toy. It honestly wasn't the best environment in which to test it out; I really had to strain to hear what it was saying. Regardless, it's a fine little thing if you're after a charming little accessory for your office desk.</p>
<p>Sorry... what do you mean it's meant for kids? Don't be silly.</p>

<figure data-uuid="83238df4a3f5f"><a title="Kamiya Book 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83238df4a3f5f/kamiya-book-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hideki Kamiya, the legendary game developer behind titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a>, is getting his own book.</p>
<p>Titled <strong>'The World of Hideki Kamiya'</strong>, the book is currently only confirmed for release in Japan on <strong>2nd April 2026</strong>, but we'll be keeping a close eye on a potential western release. Naturally, it will cover Kamiya's career, with the creator providing his own thoughts on some of the games he's made over the years.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you can also expect to find over 100 examples of concept art from his games. Heck, even the front cover is an absolute banger, showcasing the likes of Dante from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry">Devil May Cry,</a> Leon and Claire from Resident Evil 2, and Amaterasu from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="53peCvnRDq8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt53peCvnRDq8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938a0nvgszp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Speaking of which, Kamiya is currently hard at work on the official sequel to Okami at his new studio Clovers in collaboration with Capcom. There's no word on when the game might release, but we're very excited to see more.</p>
<p>For now, here's a look at the front cover for The World of Hideki Kamiya:</p>

<p>Fellow game developer Yoko Taro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/hideki-kamiyas-block-happy-take-no-crappery-is-super-reassuring-says-yoko-taro">recently commented</a> on Kamiya's penchant for blocking users (or "insects", as Kamiya calls them) on social media. He noted that "it’s a net positive to instil that fear that there are some game creators who do have that edge", praising Kamiya for seemingly taking a stand.</p>
