<p>In a surprise announcement during its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rD0i4pOTk">TGS 2025 Online Program</a>, Capcom has announced a big free update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</a> on Switch (and other platforms) coming on <strong>19th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, fans are probably disappointed that it's not a brand new game, <em>but</em> this update does bring the trilogy up-to-snuff with other Ace Attorney compilations.</p>
<p>The biggest addition for some will be the addition of two new languages: Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Now more people than ever will be able to enjoy these classic games in their native language.</p>
<p>Other new features coming to the original trilogy include an art gallery, the ability to select any episode at any time from each game, a story mode that automatically solves puzzles for you, a music player, and a scene creator.</p>

<p>Some of these features are already available in other games like Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, so it's good to see Capcom going back and making tweaks.</p>
<p>If you somehow <em>still</em> haven't picked this up on Switch, then let us sway you <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">with our review</a>. Then you'll realise that you have a new franchise to be obsessed with and a lot of games to get through!</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Rejoice, Gods and Goddesses! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> launches on Switch and Switch 2 tomorrow, 25th September 2025. Gosh, can time slow down a little bit? There are <em>so many</em> games coming out at the moment.</p>
<p>You'll see reviews have gone live at a number of sites today and might be thinking "wait, where are NL's impressions?" Well, they're coming very soon! So keep an eye out in the coming days.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't quite wait, however, Felix has put together some early impressions of Supergiant Games' first-ever sequel. And, don't worry, if you've never dipped into the Early Access version of the game on Steam, there's no need to fear spoilers, as we're keeping things contained to the early hours.</p>
<p>We've also got some comparisons between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — longer load times and less-crisp visuals, and only 60fps in docked and handheld, while on Switch 2, docked performance is 120fps.</p>

<p>So if you're not sure whether to dive in tomorrow or just want to get a little bit more excited for Hades II, have a look at Felix's video up top. And then check back very soon for our full review.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget, Hades II is getting a full physical edition, and it will have the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions on the cart! If you can't wait, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/heres-when-hades-2-releases-in-your-time-zone">we've got a rundown of when the game drops in your region digitally</a>.</p>

<p>The Advance Collection, which includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_circle_of_the_moon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_harmony_of_dissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/castlevania_dracula_x">Castlevania: Dracula X / Vampire's Kiss</a>, contains four art cards, three maps, three soundtrack CDs, a special trading card and a full-colour instruction manual.</p>
<p>The maps are a particular highlight; they're hand-drawn and feature game data on the reverse side.</p>

<p>The Dominus Collection, which includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_dawn_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_portrait_of_ruin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_order_of_ecclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/haunted_castle_revisited">Haunted Castle Revisited</a>, contains three art cards, three maps, five (count 'em) soundtrack CDs, a special trading card and a full-colour instruction manual.</p>




<p>While it's possible to get these two collections in their standard physical format, these deluxe versions are really quite special, and I imagine most Castlevania fans will want them on their shelves.</p>
