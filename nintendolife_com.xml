<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/422efc4616565/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Oof</em>, well this has been <em>quite</em> the day for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> content, eh? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">spotlight Direct</a> was absolutely jam-packed with DK goodness, revealing some familiar faces, highlighting a bunch of gameplay mechanics and announcing enough collectibles to make even the most tentative completionist break out in a sweat. On top of all that, we've also got a new batch of screenshots — like we said, what a day!</p>
<p>The freshly-baked screens cover a lot of the same ground that you will have seen in the Direct, but it's a nice chance to stop for a minute and <em>really</em> soak up some of the details. Scrolling through them got us feeling sufficiently pumped for the game's <strong>17th July</strong> release date, and we thought it would be only fair to share them all with you lovely lot too.</p>
<p>So, let's check out some of these sweet snaps, shall we? Starting with the surprise reveal that started it all: Pauline!</p>

<p>And how about those vistas? Just imagine the punching potential...</p>



<p>Next, let's have a look at the three Bananza Transformations, which will see DK morph into a giant gorilla, a speedy zebra and a flying ostrich, each with its own special abilities:</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184091 @ 1750272303 -->
<p>We've got a handful of gameplay screenshots too, so you can see what exploration and Challenge Courses will look like when treated to some HUD magic:</p>


<p>And we haven't forgotten about you menu fans, either. We'll round things out with a closer look at the in-game map, the DK Art mode, and a handful of shop and Skill Point menus:</p>

<p>We're imagine we'll hear a little more from Donkey Kong Bananza before it swings its way to Switch 2 on 17th July, but for now, at least, you can consider us sufficiently hyped!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac54d4227a89c/dk-bananza-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, before the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> Direct</a>, I wasn't <em>massively</em> enthusiastic about Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 platformer.</p>
<p>I played about 20 minutes of it at one of the Switch 2 Experience events back in April, and although I was charmed by the aesthetics and the ability to smash up pieces of the environment, I couldn't help but wonder if there was something more - that Nintendo was holding back a little bit.</p>
<p>It turns out I was wrong. It held back a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>This Direct was simply magnificent and my excitement has gone from about 45/100 bananas all the way up to about 98. That's a lot of bananas! Where are the remaining two, you ask? Well, King K. Rool isn't there, but we can't have everything now, can we?</p>

<p>My concern around the playable demo was that the game would amount to little more than smashing through the terrain to find collectibles ('Banandium Gems'). Surely there was more to it, right? Well, yes.</p>
<p>For starters, let's just touch on the wonderful bait and switch regarding Odd Rock and Pauline. We kinda knew something like this was in the works following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">unfortunate leak</a>, but it's still an incredible move. I honestly couldn't click with Odd Rock from the earlier promotional material, so to learn that DK will instead spend his time with a young Pauline was an absolute delight.</p>
<p>You can keep your depressing father/daughter dynamic, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/last_of_us_part_i">The Last of Us</a> – this is much more up my street.</p>

<p>Pauline's not just there for show, either. With special Bananza Powers, she can burst into song and enable DK to transform into completely new forms. Kong Bananza looks absolutely awesome, but I'm sorry, Zebra Bananza? <em>Ostrich Bananza..?!</em> I'm gonna need plushies of those right now, thank you very much.</p>
<p>The transformations grant you extra strength, speed, and the ability to fly, and just these alone make the gameplay look infinitely more varied and compelling than what I saw in the early demo. I've a feeling there might be a few more transformations Nintendo hasn't revealed just yet too. How about Sloth Bananza? <em>Anyone..?</em></p>
<p>Quick glimpses of other gameplay features — including the Challenge Course Ruins, the skill tree, and collectible costumes — did a lot to boost my excitement too. Side-scrolling levels are back! Rambi is back! And I simply can't wait to experiment with the different clothing and colour options. Who knew that an ice-themed Donkey Kong would look so cool?</p>

<p>And of course, I have to give a shoutout to the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-channels-super-mario-64-energy-with-its-dk-artist-mode">DK Artist mode</a>. As someone who messed around with the 3D menu-screen Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> longer than I care to admit, being able to chip chunks off DK's face or Bowser's hair and create some truly terrifying monstrosities makes me more excited than DK gobbling up a Banandium Gem. It looks absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>all</em> for me, admittedly. Chances are I won't go into photo mode too much or jump into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-features-two-player-co-op-and-you-can-even-gameshare-to-switch-1">co-op multiplayer</a>, and there's not a hope in hell I'm buying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">another amiibo</a>, but I appreciate their inclusion regardless.</p>
<p>I've got to be honest, though: after the incredibly disappointing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong> Direct</a> in April, which basically just went over everything we already knew and did very little to move my excitement beyond about 70 blue shells out of 100, the DK Direct totally 180-ed me.</p>
<p>I was <em>mildly</em> excited before, but now it's my most anticipated game of the year. Bravo, Nintendo. Just don't tell Samus.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/shuhei-yoshida-says-sony-doesnt-really-consider-nintendo-as-competition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida is at it again, sharing thoughts and feelings about the gaming industry at large, including Nintendo. And this time, he's opened up on Sony's thoughts on Nintendo on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEdedQ9_zBQ&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to the duo (thanks, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/17/shuhei-yoshida-says-playstation-only-really-views-nintendo-as-competition-in-japan/">My Nintendo News</a>!), Yoshida — who shares that he got "so many inspirations from Nintendo's games — admits that Sony's "perception of the competition" is focused on Xbox. At least, that's the case internationally (from around <a href="https://youtu.be/fEdedQ9_zBQ?si=JlW2oj_Z3J1jsVHi&amp;t=509">08:28</a>).</p>
<p>Yoshida puts this down to the similarities in hardware and performance for Xbox and Sony, and Nintendo focusing on "family-friendly" stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Sony] see Microsoft being the competition because Xbox is very similar – performance, hardware. Like a high-end console, mature games and Nintendo is very, very different. Nintendo is family-friendly, games for everyone, and not about technology, it’s more about having fun with friends and family and always have multiple controllers, bundled with the hardware.</p>
<p>Inside Sony, even when they do a business analysis, Nintendo doesn't show up, so there's a competition market share between PlayStation and Xbox, and they don't include Nintendo. Not that they're ignoring Nintendo, but that they do not necessarily feel Nintendo is competition because Nintendo is covering a different audience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yoshida is full of praise for the Kyoto-based company throughout the podcast, saying that "we all think it's great to have Nintendo continue to be successful so that we can continue to grow the industry together".</p>
<p>But there is one market where, unsurprisingly, Sony <em>does</em> consider Nintendo as fierce competition: Japan. You've seen it on the weekly Japanese Charts where Nintendo Switch games (and now Switch 2 games) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/japanese-charts-capcom-fighting-collection-2-brawls-its-way-to-the-top">regularly</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/japanese-charts-fantasy-life-i-caps-off-the-switch-1-with-a-big-win">dominate</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">sales numbers</a>, so we're not surprised to hear the now-retired SIE Worldwide Studios president say this.</p>
<p>Yoshida-san talks about the perception in a bit more detail here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Japan Nintendo is hugely strong, and Xbox almost doesn’t exist... I should be careful I may get hate messages! It's very hard to see where Xbox is, even though PC gaming is becoming a bit more popular in Japan.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But it’s all about Nintendo versus Sony. So PlayStation people working in Japan see Nintendo clearly as competition, but outside Japan, PlayStation people clearly see Xbox as a primary competition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's nothing <em>too</em> surprising going on here — Nintendo is doing its own thing, absolutely dominating in Japan, while Sony is doing well elsewhere and competing with Xbox for the big powerhouse market share worldwide.</p>
<p>But the Switch 2 seems to be doing pretty darn well in its early days, so maybe Sony will need to reconsider? The new console has sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units in just four days worldwide</a>, and nearly a million of those are from Japan — at least <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">according to Famitsu's figures</a>.</p>
<p><em>You can watch the full interview up top, but let us know what you think of Yoshida's comments down below.</em></p>
