<p>Patch 1.2 offers up a healthy batch of fixes and improvements, including gameplay tweaks, visual updates, and quality-of-life additions such as a separate save slot for quick saves. It's all very welcome, and should go toward making an already-excellent game even better.</p>
<p>We gave System Shock 2 a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">9/10 in our recent review</a>, highlighting the amazing story and explorative elements, but noting that the combat could feel slightly dated at times.</p><div><figure data-videoid="gbGX-nnXc-E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d3c45rqozig&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbGX-nnXc-E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 / Vita" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/210b61a9a6315/switch-2-vita.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite Sony's PS5 being on the market for nearly five years at this point, it still somehow feels <em>way</em> too soon to be talking about the inevitable PS6 – who even wants or needs one yet? Alas, here we are.</p>
<p>The latest rumour from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/rumour-ps6-handheld-device-can-be-docked-like-nintendo-switch-2">Push Square</a>) is particularly significant, because it seems to hint that Sony is planning to launch a variant of the PS6 that will not only be handheld, but can be docked – just like the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Codenamed 'Canis', the handheld is supposedly one of three SKUs planned for the PS6. The main one will be the 'Orion', which will be your bog-standard 'flagship' console with <em>all the specs</em>. The second is the 'Canis' handheld, and the third is the 'Canis' console, or the 'PS6 S'.</p>
<p>The latter two will share similar specs and will likely lean closer to what Sony is currently offering with the PS5/PS5 Pro, albeit with a few minor upgrades here and there.</p>
<p>So essentially, rather than focusing on sheer power – because if it ain't obvious by now, we're very much in the era of diminishing returns – Sony is seemingly looking to capture both the console and handheld market. Hopefully this might also mean that it's is able to offer slightly cheaper options, because if the so-called 'Orion' is going to retail at a similar price to the PS5 Pro ($749.99 / £699.99), Sony's going to have a real hard time shifting many of them.</p>
<p>Still, it's early days yet. It's best to take these rumours with a grain of salt for now until Sony officially reveals its plans.</p>
<p>Tell you what though, we know we said it's still way too early for a PS6, but a proper, native handheld PlayStation sounds awfully tempting...</p>
