<p>On the surface, this looks like a bartop arcade cabinet, but in reality, it's a cradle for your Switch console that allows you to use authentic arcade-style controls with games that benefit from digital input – such as old-school titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-shmups">shmups</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-fighting-games">fighting games</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ntgoyi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro doesn't come preassembled, but putting it together (and taking it apart) is a straightforward process. Two caddy sections are included, one for the original Switch / Switch OLED, and one for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Ensuring compatibility with both generations is a nice touch, but this really feels like it was designed for the newer variant; the cut-out for the screen is designed with Switch 2's larger display in mind, so the original Switch ends up looking like a toddler in a teenager's clothing.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Mini Arcade Pro's arcade-style controls are excellent regardless of which system you own. The clicky stick and buttons are smaller than you'd find on your typical bartop arcade cabinet, but they're a joy to use; within moments of booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, I was pulling off special moves with the minimum of effort.</p>
<p>Shmups also benefit massively from this accessory — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> is a particular joy to play — and I also enjoyed romping my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a85ebc9a58b26"><a title="Review: iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a85ebc9a58b26/review-imp-gaming-mini-arcade-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>There's space on the rear of the unit for 12 Switch Game Cards and 12(!) MicroSD cards — <em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The central panel has all of the usual inputs (including a Home button which wakes your console from its sleep mode), as well as a switch which allows you to toggle the functionality of the stick – you can choose between the D-pad, left analogue stick, and right analogue stick. There's a 'C' button to bring up GameChat, but no 'Capture' button, oddly.</p>
<p>Spin it around, and there's space for you to clip in 12 Switch game cards and 12 MicroSD cards – a nice touch if you want to keep your software close at hand. My only reservation with this system is that the Game Card slots don't seem to grip all that well, and it doesn't take much to knock them out of the slots by accident.</p>
<p>My other major issue with the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro is the artwork that has been printed onto the marquee, side panels, and the main control panel. The lettering is a <em>little</em> too childish for my liking, and while I'm not entirely sure, I think I detect the use of Generative AI to create the art itself. This obviously has no impact on the controller's performance, but it makes it look a little cheap, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The Switch's recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-is-your-third-party-switch-2-dock-still-working-after-this-weeks-system-update">firmware update</a> actually broke the Mini Arcade Pro's ability to wake the console via the Home button and the functionality of the 'C' button, but, in a move which hopefully shows how committed the manufacturer is to making this device a success, it has <a href="https://impgaming.uk/v21/">received a firmware update</a> to fix the problem.</p>
<p>While I think the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro's cheap-looking artwork counts against it, I can't fault the controller when it comes to delivering that old-school arcade experience. At £45, it's not likely to break the bank, either (although it's $90 in the US).</p>

Square Enix has announced that its music and merchandising arm is teaming up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> (yep, <em>the</em> Undertale) on a special line of merch to celebrate the latter's 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>Details are pretty slim on what this collaboration will entail for the time being, but the Square Enix statement shared to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/square-enix-games.com/post/3m65gk7kzj22i">Bluesky</a> promises "Music, apparel... things a little strange, but somehow wonderful, are starting to take shape".</p>
<p>We also know that the collaboration will be available <em>worldwide</em>, so you'll be able to get your hands on the merch (whatever it turns out to be) wherever you are.</p><div><figure data-videoid="cx2Jhoc0rgQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cx2Jhoc0rgQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytcx2Jhoc0rgQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cx2Jhoc0rgQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cx2Jhoc0rgQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38ea9fgxmtyn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the full announcement statement, followed by the post itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huh?! UNDERTALE X SQUARE ENIX?!<br>
...Yeah, you read that right.<br>
To celebrate UNDERTALE's 10th anniversary, a special collaboration with SQEX Music &amp; Merchandising is happening!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The specifics on the merch will have to wait for another day — the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/UNDERTALE/en/">Square Enix website</a> is currently awash with "Coming Soon" messages on the 'Goods' front — but we do know that a chilled soundtrack titled '<a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/undertale_-chitei-de-chill">Undertale: Chitei de Chill</a>' will be released early next year.</p>
<p>This one is now available to pre-order from the <a href="https://gb.store.square-enix-games.com/undertale_-chitei-de-chill">Square Enix Store</a> for <strong>$39.99 / £29.99</strong>, and features renditions of 20 Undertale tracks in beautifully chilled arrangements. You'll find the sweet new cover art, by painter NOVOL, and the official CD blurb text below:</p>
