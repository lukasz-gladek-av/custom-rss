<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is now available. If you are wondering how the Switch 2 version holds up, the <a href="https://youtu.be/V5Ai1Zg4jGU?t=21">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has released a side-by-side graphics and performance comparison, showing it alongside the original Switch release.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition runs at 4K at 60fps docked, and there's also a 120fps option - lowering the game's resolution to 1080p. As for the handheld mode, players can expect a bump from 720p on Switch to 1080p on the Switch 2, with the game running at 120fps. You can see it all in motion in the video above.</p>
<p>The game's frame rate on the Switch 2 is mostly consistent when it comes to reaching its target frames, even on the higher 120fps setting. As we've already noted, this is a free upgrade if you already own the Switch version of the title. You can access this download from the eShop.</p>
<p>And if you don't own Hollow Knight on either of these platforms, it will set you back $15.00 / £10.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/chrono-trigger-xenogears-writer-is-releasing-a-brand-new-rpg-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1427554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment during today's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>, you may have caught a glimpse at a cute-looking RPG called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/another-eden-begins">Another Eden Begins</a>. Coming to Switch 2 and Switch 1 this <strong>summer</strong>, it features time travel, turn-based combat, ten different endings, and New Game+.</p>
<p>What if we also told you that the creator was none other than Masato Kato, one of the writers of acclaimed '90s Squaresoft RPGs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/xenogears">Xenogears</a>, as well as the director of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross</a>? And that the game's music is composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who <em>also</em> worked on all three of those games? The pieces are starting to fall into place now.</p>
<p>Yep, while it may have been a footnote during the Direct, this sounds like a big one for classic RPG fans. Plus, while it's not immediately clear from the trailer, this is almost-definitely a reworking of Kato's free-to-play mobile RPG <strong><a href="https://en.another-eden.jp/">Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space</a></strong>, which came out in 2017 and is still ongoing.</p>

<p>Fans online seem to think so, highlighting that Begins appears to only cover the first "arc" of the mobile game, while highlighting some of the differences, including a few character redesigns.</p>
<p>Taking place across multiple timelines, Aldo's younger sister is kidnapped by the Beast King. Forced to pursue them, the young hero finds himself falling through spacetime, where he awakens 800 years in the future.</p>
<p>As Aldo, you'll gather 18 different companions, including an android, a feisty hunter, and a noble frog samurai. Look, <em>you're</em> thinking it, not us (Okay, maybe us too) to help traverse the timelines and save the world. Blend in some strategic turn-based combat and you have a JRPG that feels ripped right out of the SNES and PSOne era.</p>

<p>So, this seems to be following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> formula of reworking a mobile favourite to remove the gacha elements <em>and</em> make it fit on home consoles. We'll have to wait for more details, but for now, this looks promising.</p>

<p>Arisen for a new console</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The <strong>Tales of</strong> series is on a bit of a roll at the moment, and Switch 2 owners have something to celebrate, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tales-of-arise-beyond-the-dawn-edition">Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn Edition</a> is coming to the console on <strong>22nd May 2026</strong>. it's getting both a physical and digital release.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tales_of_arise">Tales of Arise</a> is the most-recent entry in Bandai Namco's action RPG series; it came out on other platforms back in 2021, with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tales_of_arise_beyond_the_dawn">Beyond the Dawn</a> expansion following in 2023. The Switch 2 release will include the expansion as-standard.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is the first Tales of game to get a native Switch 2 version — even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a>, which comes out at the end of the month, is only on Switch 1. But Tales of Arise also isn't part of the recent slate of remasters, making this a straight port of the critically-acclaimed game.</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are some more details on the game courtesy of Bandai Namco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tales of ARISE</strong> immerses players into a conflict between two worlds. For 300 years, <strong>Rena</strong> has ruled over <strong>Dahna</strong>, pillaging the planet’s resources and stripping its people of dignity and freedom.</p>
<p>The story begins with two individuals, born in different worlds, each looking to change their fate and create a new future. Featuring a diverse cast of characters, an intuitive and rewarding combat system, and a captivating story set in a lush world, <strong>Tales of ARISE</strong> delivers a first-class <strong>JRPG</strong> experience.</p>
<p>Players will follow <strong>Alphen</strong>, a masked amnesic man who can’t feel pain as he encounters <strong>Shionne</strong>, the cursed woman that inflicts agony upon everything she touches. They will both get to know each other and meet a varied cast of allies to take on the Renan Lords, powerful foes, in order to free <strong>Dahna</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We've had four Tales games on Switch 1 and Switch 2 between the start of 2025 and 2026, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a>, and the aforementioned Tales of Berseria Remastered and Tales of Arise. Where will the series take us next on Nintendo's hybrid console? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
