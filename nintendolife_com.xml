<p>September is built for LEGO games it seems</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_voyagers">LEGO Voyagers</a> — the two-player co-op adventure from Light Box Studios, the developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_builders_journey">LEGO Builder’s Journey</a> — is coming to Switch on <strong>15th September 2025</strong> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/lego-voyagers-official-release-date-trailer">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Originally announced at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/lego-party-gets-the-party-started-on-switch-this-september-physical-release-confirmed">Summer Game Fest Opening Night Live</a>, Voyagers joins the LEGO Party as the second Lego game to launch in September (technically first as it launches before the Mario Party-like).</p>
<p>Unlike Party, however, Voyagers is a co-op physics platformer where you and a buddy, who can play locally, online, or via a Friend’s Pass (like Hazelight's It Takes Two or Split Fiction, only one person needs a copy of the game), team up to discover what it's like to be a Lego brick,</p>
<p>And the game looks <em>just</em> like an actual collection of Lego bricks, but with an added dose of cute. Who knew Lego bricks could look this adorable?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what to expect from the game from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/">Steam page:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the makers of LEGO® Builder's Journey comes a new 2-player co-op adventure about friendship and play. When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<p>- Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</p>
<p>- Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
<p>- Cooperatively solve the game's many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</p>
<p>- Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friend’s Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</p>

<p>Hint: it's the same as Japan!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Clear River Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> will launch on Switch in the West on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. That's the same date as Japan!</p>
<p>Developed by City Connection Co. Ltd, the game will receive a physical edition in addition to the usual digital release on Switch, a whopping 27 years after its original release on the PlayStation in 1998.</p>
<p>R-Type Delta will run at 60fps on the Switch and you'll also have the option to swap between the new HD visuals and the original presentation. A newly arranged soundtrack is also available, while players can tinker around with the game's multiple difficulty settings for the optimum experience.</p>
<p>If you want a taster before launch and happen to be attending either GamesCom or PAX West this year, R-Type Delta: HD Boosted will be available to try out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the year 2163, having triumphed over the Bydo Empire, the R9 was recovered and stored within a space fortress orbiting Earth. Humanity breathed a collective sigh of relief, but this was short-lived when in 2164 unidentified objects fell from the sky, followed electronic weapons systems running amok, and culminating in an ‘annihilation unit’ stored alongside the R9 suddenly going berserk, descending to Earth and beginning a wave of destruction. To bring the situation under control, the prototype test unit “R9 Delta” is deployed—marking the beginning of a new battle against the Bydo."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll keep you up to date on any fresh announcements regarding R-Type Delta as soon as we hear more.</p>
