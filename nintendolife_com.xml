<p>"I would say it looks better than the PS4 version"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="FF7 Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/194501ab62791/ff7-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> was playable on Switch 2 last week at Gamescom, and it seems that most who managed to go hands-on with the game came away feeling pretty positive about it.</p>
<p>Now, in a new post from Digital Foundry advertising its latest DF Weekly episode, John Linneman has come out and said that FF7R is "the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2". High praise, indeed! Now, this is only from a short clip posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdkjeb6sj3aqwwtwnbuusybk/post/3lx6fxspghc2r">Bluesky</a>, so we might be missing a little bit of extra context here, but the overall sentiment is that this is a really solid Switch 2 port from Square Enix.</p>
<p>Here's what Linneman had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm gonna say right now, this is the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2. Seeing that game running at a stable 30fps, with that excellent motion blur especially, it looked fantastic. It was completely stable, it looked on par – actually I would say it looks better than the PS4 version, at a glance.</p>
<p>"If I had to guess – and I haven't been able to compare because we don't have footage – it's gonna fall somewhere between the PS4 and PS5 versions. So we'll see if that holds true for the final game, but that's the sensation I got while playing it. The image quality was absolutely superb, like it looked really great, it matched the 1080p screen. I was really, really happy about that. So that's a good one."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no firm release date for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade just yet, but it's supposedly still on track to launch later this year.</p>
<p>Square Enix is adopting a new approach with its games, striving to make as many of them available on all major platforms where possible. It recently detailed its efforts to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/square-enix-details-plan-to-reboot-and-awaken-its-business">'reboot and revive'</a> its business in the midst of challenging financial results.</p>

<p>Gee, ya think?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Raidou - GKC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c99fcacdec82f/raidou-gkc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japan's <a href="https://www.ndl.go.jp/en/">National Diet Library</a> (or 'NDL', for short) is one of the biggest libraries in the world and, from the year 2000, began to obtain video game CDs and cartridges for preservation purposes.</p>
<p>According to an article from <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/48598">Famitsu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-not-eligible-for-preservation-by-japans-national-diet-library-officials-say/">Automaton</a>), however, the library does not consider the Switch 2's Game-Key Cards as 'proper' physical media and therefore will not be accepting them into its 9,600-strong catalogue of game titles.</p>
<p>It shouldn't <em>really</em> come as a surprise when you consider what Game-Key Cards are. As discussed at length since the Switch 2's reveal back in April, Game-Key Cards don't hold any data beyond a license to download a game title from the eShop.</p>
<p>Not only does this present potential issues regarding storage and the near-mandatory need to purchase SD Express cards, but it's also a huge risk to preservation efforts should the eShop ever suspend its functionality.</p>
<p>So yeah, no one's going to preserve a piece of plastic that has no meaningful data on it, right? But to be super clear, the NDL stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since a key card, on its own, does not qualify as content, it falls outside of our scope for collection and preservation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems about as clear-cut as you can get. Nintendo has recently been attempting to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-sends-out-second-game-key-card-and-physical-game-survey">gauge interest in Game-Key Cards via customer surveys</a>, but at the time of writing has not made any moves to introduce more options for third-party publishers and customers alike.</p>
<p>Only a handful of third-party Switch 2 games have received a proper physical release, and according to a recent online listing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a> can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/yooka-replaylee-appears-to-be-getting-a-proper-physical-release-for-switch-2">potentially be counted amongst the elite few</a>. An official announcement seems to be just around the corner, so we'll be sure to provide an update as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>Let's test it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> would be making its way to the Switch 2 in <strong>2026</strong> came as a <em>very</em> pleasant surprise during the recent Gamescom festivities.</p>
<p>Whether you've played through the game before or simply seen the odd trailer here and there, we can probably all agree that The Great Circle looks pretty spectacular – particularly in its environmental design. So just how will a game like this run on the Switch 2?</p>
<p>Well, that's what our lovely video producer Alex is looking to find out. Using the Xbox Series S as a rough guide, he presents a hypothetical vision of what The Great Circle might look like on Nintendo's new system. He doesn't stop there though – oh no. He also checks out the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/doom_the_dark_ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As Alex notes in the video, these are not outright predictions about which games will likely come to the Switch (beyond Indy, of course), but merely hypothetical glimpses into how they <em>might</em> run with the Switch 2's specs. It's not an exact science, but it should give you a flavour, at least.</p>

<p>Though it's hardly the best quality</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Following on from our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/first-footage-of-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2-appears-online">first glimpse</a> at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> running on Switch 2 via docked mode, new footage has been posted online to showcase how the game is holding up in handheld mode.</p>
<p>General sentiments from hands-on sessions – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/first-footage-of-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2-appears-online">including our own</a> – is that Elden Ring struggles somewhat in handheld mode, with frame rate being a particularly disappointing factor. The new footage, posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtCATdtUK1c">@NGamz</a> on YouTube, does very little to either confirm or deny the initial feedback from early players, thanks in large part to the overall quality (or lack thereof – hello, 720p) of the footage itself.</p>
<p>Still, you can get a general sense of how things are holding up, and it looks... <em>okay</em>..? Again, judging frame rate from an over-the-shoulder perspective isn't ideal, so it's tough to really gauge whether there are any jitters or hiccups affecting the gameplay.</p>
<p>The footage showcases the initial area of Limgrave, with the player navigating toward Stormgate and Stormhill while slaying a bunch of enemies along the way. The video above is just one of three posted on NGamz channel, so feel free to check out the others if you want to see more; truth be told, though, it's just more of the same.</p>
<p>There's still no release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition at the time of writing, but the debut trailer reveal indicated that it would launch later this year. Unless initial feedback has spooked FromSoftware into pouring more time into the game, there's nothing to indicate that it might slip into the new year.</p>

<p>"I’m hoping it’s going to work out"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During PlayStation's State of Play presentation earlier this year, Grasshopper Manufacture announced <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a> from Suda51 and Ren Yamazaki, and it sounds like Switch 2 owners <em>may</em> be getting in on the action when the game launches in 2026.</p>
<p>According to an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6gNvAdHnfs">GameXplain</a>, Suda51 stated that the development team is currently "in the middle of doing a bunch of tests and stuff basically to see if we can put it on Switch 2". By no means is this a definitive confirmation that the game is heading to Nintendo's latest hybrid system, but it's a promising development that gives us hope.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what Suda51 said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Right at this moment, we’re in the middle of doing a bunch of tests and stuff basically to see if we can put it on Switch 2. I personally would love to get it on the Switch 2. I’m hoping it’s going to work out. It just depends on the results of this testing we’re doing. If Epic ends up working out for us – it’s made with Unreal Engine – and if it works out on Switch 2, then we’re going to do what we can to put it on Switch 2.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romeo is a Dead Man is described as an 'ultra-violent science fiction' game depicting third-person melee combat – not entirely unlike the <strong>No More Heroes</strong> series, then! It's looking like the kind of experience that could only come from the mind of Suda51, so we've got our fingers crossed that we'll be playing it on Switch 2 alongside the other target platforms.</p>
