<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64b5e14804dbd/joy-con-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A few days back, the online repair community iFixit <a href="https://x.com/iFixit/status/1930781813770727437">posted a brief teardown</a> of the new Switch 2 Joy-Con and confirmed that the sticks are nearly identical to the Switch 1 in terms of how they've been built.</p>
<p>Naturally, then, this has caused a bit of kerfuffle with fans; many of which are understandably concerned that Joy-Con drift will continue to be a major issue for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So much so, in fact, that GuliKit – a company that specialises in the production of hall effect and TMR joysticks – has confirmed it is hard at work on producing replacement sticks for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Stick drift had plagued the original Switch during its (ongoing) lifespan, with Nintendo facing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/switch-joy-con-drift-class-action-lawsuit-dismissed-after-five-years">numerous lawsuits over the issue</a>. Here at Nintendo Life, we've had staff members burn through several Joy-Con controllers thanks to drifting, so it's definitely a pretty widespread issue.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2 still in its infancy, it's hard to know at this stage whether Joy-Con drift will continue to be a major problem, but it's one we'll be keeping a close eye on in the coming months and years.</p>
