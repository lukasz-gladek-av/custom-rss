<hr>
<p>Okay, so, look, I wasn't <em>trying</em> to do a heist. This is all a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p>See, the Louvre is mostly known for its paintings, statues, stealing art from other countries, and being hard to pronounce for anyone who doesn't have a French tongue. (<em>Loov. Looooov-ruh. Loovuhrrr. Loovurhrh.</em> Never mind.) Also, that one really famous, wildly underwhelming picture of the lady with the mystic smile.</p>
<p>But that's not what I care about when it comes to the Louvre. The Parisian pyramid is the only museum in the world that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/12/hands_on_nintendo_3ds_guide_louvre">used 3DSes as their audio guides</a>, and I've never had the chance to try them! And then, tragically, when the museum <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/louvre-says-au-revoir-to-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides">discontinued them earlier this year</a>, I thought to myself, 'Well, what are they going to do with all those 3DSes? Put them into the archive, like all the rejected paintings that don't draw a big enough crowd? I won't stand for it.'</p>
<figure data-uuid="e729831c85fd3"><a title="Louvre Guide on 3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e729831c85fd3/louvre-guide-on-3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I was going to nab a copy of the game, too — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, I went to visit the museum. Just a normal visit, you understand! And yes, I went in through a first-floor window via a ladder, but that wasn't because I was planning to steal things! I just wanted to beat the crowds. And avoid the entry cost. I mean, €25 to walk very slowly through a crowd taking selfies with the Mona Lisa? That's the real robbery here.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It was fully my intention to walk over to the information desk, politely ask about the 3DSes, and whether a caring patron of the arts such as myself could make a donation to the museum in order to take one home, and then once they'd handed me a big box of 3DSes, I would leave down my special museum ladder.</p>
<p>But once I was in, well, the crown jewels were just <em>sitting there</em>. I thought to myself, 'You can buy a <em>lot</em> of 3DSes with crown jewels money. Maybe you could even afford a single secondhand copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver</a> from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/playing-the-cex-retro-lottery">CeX</a>!'</p>
<p>Besides, I had a very capacious tote bag with me.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was slowly trundling down the ladder back to the streets of Paris that I even realised that I'd done a heist, or that no sane person on eBay is going to buy <em>obviously stolen</em> crown jewels.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with no 3DSes and too many crown jewels, and people keep writing articles about how cool I am, despite the fact that crown jewels can't play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a>.</p>
<p>Look, I wrote up a comparison:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>3DS</th>
<th>Crown Jewels</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>✅ Comes in many colours</td>
<td>❌ Comes in factory colours only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Take it anywhere</td>
<td>❌ Can only be taken to state occasions or maybe a fancy party</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Customisable home menu themes</td>
<td>❌ No home menu themes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ StreetPass!</td>
<td>❌ No StreetPass</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Playable in 2D and 3D</td>
<td>❌ No 2D option</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Can play cult classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</a></td>
<td>❌ Cannot play cult classic Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the obvious winner is the 3DS. It's not even close. And sure, the Crown Jewels make for some very nice hats, but I don't even <em>want</em> hats. I want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/pullblox">Pullblox</a>, on a commuter train, with the option to make my eyes feel like they're being peeled from the inside!</p>
<p>Crown Jewels don't even have expandable SD card storage, so even if I <em>wanted</em> to take them to fancy parties or state occasions, I'd have to bring a separate external hard drive with me for all my games. Who wants to bring an external hard drive to a masquerade ball, or the coronation of the new monarch? Not me. It's very unfashionable.</p>

<p>But all is not lost. I have, in fact, started to melt down a couple of the pieces, because I have an amazing idea. I may not have a Louvre 3DS, but I do have a <em>normal</em> 3DS, and it's one of the 'New' ones with swappable faceplates. I've had mine protected by an understated Triforce-pattern plate for a long, long time, so I think I've earned a little glitz and glamour, haven't I?</p>
<p>It turns out that gluing 10-carat emeralds to a bit of plastic is a <em>little</em> difficult, but it's worth it. I feel like a queen, if queens knew what autostereoscopic handheld video game consoles were. It does make the thing bloody heavy, though.</p>
<p>Oh, and hopefully it goes without saying, but please don't tell anyone that I did the heist, okay? I really, really don't want to go to French prison. Or any kind of prison, really. I don't think they let you keep your 3DSes when you're incarcerated. Thanks.</p>

<p>"It’s a given that Super Mario will constantly evolve"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="885a84dfd21f9"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/885a84dfd21f9/super-mario-bros-wonder.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's incredible to think how much <strong>Super Mario</strong> has evolved since those early days back in the '80s.</p>
<p>Starting as a simple, albeit incredibly intuitive 2D platformer, Mario has since developed the ability to fly, shoot water from F.L.U.D.D, traverse the literal depths of space, and transform into completely different characters via an anthropomorphic hat known as 'Cappy'.</p>
<p>But of course, if Mario is to reach his 100th anniversary, he'll need to evolve even more. And that's exactly what his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, believes he'll do.</p>
<p>Speaking via an interview in a special Nintendo Museum book to celebrate Super Mario's 40th anniversary (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hell-constantly-evolve-nintendo-creators-discuss-if-mario-can-reach-100-years/">VGC</a>), Miyamoto, alongside Takashi Tezuka, Koji Kondo, and Toshihiko Nakago, says that Mario "will constantly evolve by incorporating new digital technology" in an effort to reach that lofty 100th anniversary. Furthermore, despite branching out into new mediums, Miyamoto believes Mario's true appeal lies in the interactivity that games provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now we’re working in visual fields like movies, but I want to make sure we keep it interactive and digital. As long as we don’t forget Mario’s prime point – running and jumping – as we add new things, I think Mario will be with us for a long time to come.</p>
<p>“Nintendo takes on unique challenges, and if a new technology is interesting, I believe that by incorporating that technology, we can make that fun expand and grow-like rolling up snow for a snowman. So I hope that you will continue to stick with us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tezuka expands on this by stressing the need to keep players from getting bored while playing Mario games, stating that he's "always thinking of how to keep it so that something like that doesn’t happen so that people keep playing".</p>
<p>And just in case you needed a bit of reassurance, Tezuka finishes by stating "We’ll continue to make Mario games for a long time", so that's good to know.</p>
