<figure data-uuid="5f8d219631ef7"><a title="Rockbeasts / Demon Tides" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f8d219631ef7/rockbeasts-demon-tides.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've already rounded up all of the Switch announcements from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">The Game Awards 2025</a>, but that wasn't the only showcase that Mr Keighley served up this holiday season.</p>
<p>As ever, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY">Day of the Devs</a> was on hand to highlight a bunch of upcoming indies that we can look forward to in the next year or two. It was a slightly slimmer showing on the Switch front than we have seen in previous years (at least, as far as <em>confirmed</em> Switch releases go), but there were still two titles that have already announced a Switch (2) launch.</p>
<p>First up, we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rockbeasts">Rockbeasts</a>, a '90s "rock-and-roll management RPG", that sees you put in charge of a grunge rock band comprised of anthropomorphised wilderbeast... and a fish. It sounds like a lot, and it looks like it, too. The gameplay has a bit of everything — rhythm games, management sims, visual novels — and the whole thing has a visual style that looks like it's just stumbled out of a <strong>Bojack Horseman</strong> episode.</p>
<p>In short, we're <em>very</em> interested to find out more. Rockbeasts doesn't have a firm release date at the time of writing, but the devs <em>did</em> confirm that it will be launching on Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Rock on, dude!</p>

<p>The second Switch game showcased in the latest Day of the Devs was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demon_tides">Demon Tides</a>. You might remember this one from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-day-of-the-devs-the-game-awards-edition-2024-every-announcement-confirmed-switch-games#demon-tides-2025-switch-unconfirmed">last year's DotD event</a>, and yes, it still looks awesome. This is the next 3D platformer from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a> dev Fabraz, combining super slick-looking movement with the most toe-tapping of hip-hop scores.</p>
<p>Once again, there's no Switch release date for this one just yet, though Fabraz has confirmed that Fangamer will be handling a <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1998833988883107978">physical release</a>, so that's something to look forward to!</p>

<p>Naturally, there's every chance that we will see a fair few of the other games from the latest Day of the Devs showcase pop up on Switch at some point down the line. Switch 2 is still very much the new kid in town, so we'd be surprised if indie devs don't want to capitalise on its relative hotness and bring their titles over.</p>
<p>We've added the full Day of the Devs: The Game Awards 2025 Edition showcase below, so you can take a look at all the games revealed and make your own predictions about whether they will be heading to Switch or not.</p>

<p>Shipping Spring 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've had mixed opinions on the CRKD Nitro Deck for the Switch, but now the company has come out swinging with a brand new iteration – and it's compatible with both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nitro Deck 2</strong> starts shipping in <strong>Spring 2026</strong> and looks to be a significant upgrade over the previous model. It seems the company has the Switch 2 in mind with this new product, but those still on the original Switch can still get in on the action. You'll just need to utilise the additional centrepiece to make up for the height difference, while turning the dial on the back to decrease the length of the chassis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Deck 2 has offset analogue sticks which, for the first time, aren't situation directly above and below the d-pad and face buttons. They utilise capacitor-based technology are said to be free from potential drifting issues. It also features additional back buttons, adjustable deadzones, turbo mode, and more.</p>
<p>The d-pad design and stick tops can also be swapped out, but be mindful that these additional parts are sold separately.</p>

<p>Pricing is confirmed at <strong>£89.99</strong> for the Nitro Deck 2 itself, while any addition d-pad/stick packs are <strong>£19.99</strong> each. Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2">CRKD website</a>.</p>

<p>Currently confirmed for "PC and Consoles"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><strong>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</strong> was one of the most surprising reveals at this year's The Game Awards, marking a huge return to the RPG series that put Bioware on the map.</p>
<p>The original developer is nowhere to be seen, however, with this new title now in the hands of Arcanaut Studios, founded in July 2025. Its CEO, Casey Hudson, is heading up development for Fate of the Old Republic (FOTOR..?), having previously directed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> and the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big deal, then. It's clear that the new game is early in development given how recent the studio itself was formed, and as such, no specific platforms have been confirmed beyond a rather vague "PC and Consoles". So we have no idea if this thing is heading to the Switch 2 or not, but we reckon it's a little too early to make the call either way.</p>
<p>The trailer itself gives us next to nothing, as you'd expect. It shows what is likely to be the main protagonist landing on a planet with two companions before making her way into a derelict crash site. There, she encounters a mysterious creature and ignites her lightsaber. That's it!</p>
<p>Lots of questions, then. Is this game even considered canon at this point? Our knowledge is a <em>little</em> rusty these days, admittedly, but our understanding is that the canon equivalent of the 'Old Republic' is now the 'High Republic'. All of that 'pre-Disney' stuff is now part of the 'Legends' continuity.</p>
<p>Still, it looks cool, and we'll be keeping a close eye on it in the months (and years) to come.</p>

<p>Yes, alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Nintendo picking up a couple of awards</a>, there were also a bunch of "World Premieres" and updates for titles we can expect to play on our beloved hybrids at some point down the line.

<p>The following titles weren't graced with a Switch 2 logo at the end of their reveal trailers, but we think there's a pretty good chance of several them coming our way at some point down the line — either because the dev has sent their games to Switch in the past, or because the series has history with Nintendo consoles.</p>

<p>Cosmic conundrums</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Keplar Interactive and Japanese indie dev Shapefarm have announced that their brand new intergalactic puzzle adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a>, is coming exclusively to Switch 2 <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">The Game Awards</a>, which we shouldn't hold against it, Orbitals sees two players take on asymmetrical co-op tasks to stop cosmic storms from ruining their space station. Sounds quite tense. Set in a brand-new retro anime galaxy, the game is a debut effort from Shapefarm, and it's been built "from the ground up" for cooperative play, so we're looking forward to being treated to some smart puzzles, thanks.</p>
<p>You and your partner will set about utilising unique space tools, piloting a ship through meteor fields, or even just hanging out to revel in a retro anime vibe that's based off 1970s manga. So that's why the trailer, which you can see up top, looks so very cool.</p>
<p>Indeed, the devs have gone to the trouble of partnering up with Studio Massket, a storied Japanese animation house, to create a fully original anime world complete with hand-crafted cutscenes. Oh, and it's got full English and Japanese dubs (and you can check out the Japanese version of the trailer at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>It's nice, too, to see a game that's aiming to utilise all the new tech capabilities we've got on Switch 2, with GameShare, GameChat, and all that caper used to further enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Here's some more info and some official screens to further whet your appetite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orbitals captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm.</p>
<p>Developed in Unreal Engine 5, Orbitals takes full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware to deliver an unforgettable co-operative experience regardless of your preferred way of connecting together.</p>
<p>Either by teaming up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Nintendo Switch 2 device for split-screen local co-op, using the system’s GameShare feature to share Orbitals with another local player on a compatible Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch device, or by matchmaking online with their friends and taking advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat for crystal-clear communications, players around the world can team up and save the day together as one inseparable team.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Launching 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> might want to pay attention, because another co-op adventure is heading to the Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/out-of-words">Out Of Words</a> launches in <strong>2026</strong> and is a stop motion co-op adventure from developers Kong Orange, Wired Fly, and Morten Søndergaard, with publishing duties from Epic Games. You'll explore the "wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis" as Kurt and Karla, two mouthless individuals who must work together to overcome the odds.</p>
<p>The game got its public debut at Summer Game Fest in 2025 and received plenty of critical acclaim from those who went hands-on with the demo. It's lovely, then, that it's now been confirmed for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
