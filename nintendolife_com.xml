<p>"They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware."</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We're almost three months on from the Nintendo Switch 2's release, and while we have plenty of third-party games to come on the newer hybrid console, many developers say that they're still having issues getting hold of dev kits.</p>
<p>This comes from the folks at Digital Foundry in response to a question from a listener during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=500s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">this week's DF Direct</a> (timestamped, 8:20). Part of the question focuses on Switch 2 kits, particularly pointing out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, which runs at 30fps on the newer console (though it doesn't have a specific Switch 2 version either): "Do you think Nintendo are regretting not sharing the dev kits wider, sooner?"</p>
<p>Host John Linneman, who was at Gamescom 2025, spoke to multiple developers on the show floor where "so many of them said the same thing," and that "It's really difficult right now" to even get hold of a dev kit.</p>
<p>It sounds like the enthusiasm is there — "They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware." — but the ability to get the hardware teams need to make Switch 2 games is tough. Some were apparently told "they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility."</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Switch 2 PS5 comparsion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f4e4d5b6dfae/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2-ps5-comparsion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>DF is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">full of praise for Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2</a> so far — <em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=500s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Co-host Oliver Mackenzie also weighed in, saying "I don't really understand the strategy" Nintendo is implementing in handing out dev kits.</p>
<p>The team reports "hearing things through the grapevine and talking to people" on some "weird exclusions" and "weird inclusions" , highlighting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a> as one of the latter games: "...Some big developers, on the other hand, who developed AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</p>
<p>Of course, the only people who know what's actually going on with these dev kits are at Nintendo; Mouse Work, a game specifically designed to be played in Mouse Mode, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit">can't release on Switch 2 <em>until</em> the devs get a kit</a>. Nintendo is reportedly focusing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">on indie developers and smaller studios</a>, but that still leaves a lot of teams out.</p>
<p>When you get reports about some third-party games running better on Switch 2 than others; for example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">impressed</a> at Gamescom while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">did not</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f795e741d72b/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new dawn of Castlevania started 20 years ago, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_dawn_of_sorrow">Dawn of Sorrow</a> first launched on the Nintendo DS in Japan on 25th August 2025.</p>
<p>Following on directly from the final Castlevania GBA title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Aria of Sorrow</a>, Dawn of Sorrow had big shoes to fill; a shift in art direction and the implementation of the touch screen meant that it's wasn't as well loved as its predecessor, but the game ultimately kick-started another handheld trio that, arguably, is the finest era for the series.</p>
<p>Besides the Magic Seal system — where you had to memorise and draw a seal after beating a boss to defeat them — this is all very familiar Castlevania stuff. The Tactical Soul system from Aria makes its return here, but the real draw is the ability to show the castle map on the top screen so you can track your progress as you go.</p>

<p>Taking place in the year 2036, Soma Cruz returns as the protagonist, and once again he attempts to stop the resurrection of Dracula. Now, if you've played Aria, you know the big twist, so we'll keep that under wraps.</p>
<p>But this is otherwise more solid Castlevania RPG action, with a variety of weapons and enemies to tackle. Oh, and some excellent sprite work. Soul and item drop rates are absolutely busted though... oh well!</p>
<p>The game was included in last year's excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a>, which also brings <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_portrait_of_ruin">Portrait of Ruin</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_order_of_ecclesia">Order of Ecclesia</a>, and a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/haunted_castle">Haunted Castle</a> (alongside the original arcade release). That version also mostly fixes the Magic Seal system — as in, you can use button prompts or just rewind if you mess up. We <em>totally</em> didn't do the latter. Nope.</p>

<p>Anyway, come celebrate the Dawn of Sorrow (the game, not the <em>actual</em> dawn of sorrow... we hope you're all happy) in the comments, and share your memories with the game down below. Is it your favourite DS entry? Tell us!</p>

<figure><a title="Demonschool" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c80459b665ebc/demonschool.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ysbryd Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-08-25T18:51:28+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Mon 25th Aug 2025, 7:51pm</time>]:</strong></p><p>Developer Necrosoft Games has followed up with a brief statement on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Clarifying the reason for the long delay, Necrosoft <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lxak6xi3622r">confirmed that it's more than just Silksong influencing the two month slip</a>, citing Silent Hill f, Final Fantasy Tactics, and the absolutely wild release schedule for October.</p>
<p>"This was not our choice but we understand why the choice was made," the studio states. "We're sorry this is happening."</p>
<hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> can't catch a break, can it? The upcoming tactical RPG, inspired by classic Persona, SMT, and Italian cinema, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tactical-rpg-demonschool-finally-gets-a-launch-date-and-its-real-soon">was due to release on 3rd September 2025</a>, but today, publisher Ysbryd Games has announced that it's pushing Necrosoft Games' release back to <strong>19th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? One <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which is launching <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">the day after Demonschool's previous release date</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release, Ysbryd Games' Brian Kwek says "after much anguished consideration on our part, we’ve made the decision to move the game’s release."</p>
<p>"With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."</p>
<p>The publisher says that "gaining visibility" is the main goal for the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/tactical-rpg-demonschool-has-been-delayed-yet-again">which has been delayed multiple times</a> since its reveal a few years ago — "If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lwx26vg5cc2r">official Demonschool Bluesky</a> shared this lovely photo of the game on a CRT in response to Silksong's release date, and in retrospect, it's a little amusing:</p>

<p>While the delay will be disappointing to many, Ysbryd Games has revealed that this will allow the developers to include more endings and minigames that they were "originally planned to patch in post-release.</p>
<p>Demonschool isn't the only game to delay itself to avoid Silksong's release window: <strong>CloverPit</strong>, a slot machine roguelike, and <strong>Aeterna Lucis</strong>, the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/aeterna_noctis">Aeterna Noctis</a>, have both been delayed in response to Team Cherry's hand-drawn Metroidvania release.</p>
<p>September is already jam-packed, so we hope the delay gives Demonschool the breathing room the game deserves.</p>
