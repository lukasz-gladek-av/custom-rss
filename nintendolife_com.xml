<figure><a title="Metroid Dread" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a9fba4d700ec/metroid-dread.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well hello there. Welcome. It's the weekend, and that means you're keen to see what we're going to be playing over the next couple of days while divulging your own plans. Before you do so, however, let's just recap the last handful of days.</p>
<p>First up, Nintendo announced that it would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-gba-library-with-two-more-titles">expanding its GBA app</a> with two new titles on NSO next week, so that's pretty cool. The company also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-showcases-every-switch-and-switch-2-direct-game-in-new-infographic">reiterated its recent Direct announcements</a> with the usual handy infographic. Lots of cool stuff coming out, y'all.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/it-was-a-bit-of-a-perplexing-experience-hideki-kamiya-on-the-fan-reaction-to-bayonetta-3">voiced his thoughts</a> around the reception to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>, ensuring to apply his learnings to the development of the <strong>Okami Sequel</strong>. Plus, we were treated to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2-gets-a-seven-minute-overview-trailer">pretty extensive overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on the Switch, and it's looking very tasty.</p>
<p>Finally, we provided our final thoughts on both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> DLC, so be sure to check those out if you're on the fence.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I am going to wrap myself up in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> on Switch 2 as much as I can. I'm on my own for the next few days, you see, so it's gonna be 24/7 rage-quitting online matches and looking up soccer rules in disbelief for me, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Oh, and I can't stop playing Silksong. But I don't imagine I'm particularly unique in that just now. Have a nice weekend, and should we cross paths on the FC 26 early access field of battle over the next 48hrs or thereabouts, well, honestly, I hope you get a proper stuffing, mate.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I could say "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> plus X and Y" as I have the past few weeks, but really it's just going to be Hollow Knight. I just found the double-jump and the downward-smash in quick succession, and I'm eager to crack on and make proper progress towards the endgame. <em>Newsflash!</em> It's good. It's not blowing my mind, but it feels great (man, I wish I had that Switch 2 Pro Controller, though!) and, more to the point, I'm still playing it after 20 hours. It's doing something right.</p>
<p>But yeah, I'm eager to finish. GOTY will be here before you know it.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm getting very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, folks. So I've gone back to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> one more time before Retro's latest drops in December. It's like comfort food for me, it's just too good.</p>
<p>I'd like to say I'm playing something else, but that's pretty much it! Truth be told, I'm eager to dive into <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> next week on PS5, so I'm holding off on playing anything too substantial in the meantime.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was a very lucky boy and got both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> for my birthday this week, two short little games that I could probably breeze through in a weekend (hahaha… <strong><em>gulp</em></strong>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both have sat on the sideline since I pulled them from their brightly coloured wrapping paper because Silksong is eating up <em>all of my free time.</em></p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I’m in a post-Silksong slump. I’m actually fighting back the urge to do a second playthrough or a Steel Soul run right now. But no, I have to get ready for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>’s 1.0 launch, so naturally, it’s time to start afresh in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> and see how much recent muscle-memory will screw me over.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I still have a ton of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> games to check out, but I cannot put Magic Garden down. I’m so close to getting the cherry and all achievements on it, and it’s so fun and moreish. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This is a big weekend for me! After nearly a decade of saying “This is the year I’m going to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>” it’s finally happening. I’m currently hunting down the last few Chozo Artifacts (which have been a huge pain in the morphball to find) and thankfully <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-remastered-all-artifact-locations">Ollie’s guide</a> here on Nintendo Life is keeping me sane!</p>
<p>I’ll probably wrap this up over the weekend, but there’s also the off chance that I play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> all weekend as you can now pilot the Power Rangers Megazord from now until October 3rd! I just unlocked the Green Ranger skin from the battle pass too! Young Zion is freaking out right now. I want to savour this moment for as long as I can, but honestly I wish these Fortnite events didn’t have an end date. Why can’t they run year round, as maybe a separate game mode?</p>

<p>This follows the physical edition release last month. You can find out more about this in our previous story. We originally gave this title 7 out of 10 stars, calling it a fun and appproachable 'Hades-like', best played with pals.</p>

<p>Here's what the critics had to say</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6fe86fde20c08/sonic-racing-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is out next week on multiple platforms and the first lot of reviews have now gone live.</p>
<p>If you are curious to know how this new experience generally holds up, this round up should help. When we hear more about the Switch version, we'll let you know. The Switch 2 version is also scheduled to arrive at a later date and will be available as a paid upgrade for the existing Switch release.</p>
<p>So, here are the impressions of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/sonic-racingcrossworlds/">VGC - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"CrossWorlds is a brilliant karting game with satisfying handling, a fun portal mechanic and useful customisation options. Its weapons aren't as punchy as we'd like and it's unclear how it's going to keep players' attention long-term but it's a genuine, more traditional alternative to Mario Kart now that Nintendo's pointed its series in new direction."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ygnviw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/">GamesRadar+ - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a slick, ambitious racer with loads of tracks, primed and ready for future, licensed crossovers. At first too slow and then suddenly extremely fast, the racing lacks finesse, but it gets better as you play. A strong offering that's compulsively playable, but a bit grindy in single-player and not quite S-tier on the track."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">IGN - 9/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review-an-arcade-kart-racer-for-gearheads/1900-6418408/">GameSpot - 7/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Altogether, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a solid package. The single-player modes, meta-goals like collecting gear and vehicle parts, and wealth of customization options to experiment with different play styles, make it easy to recommend for players who like their kart racing with a little more mechanical complexity. Even with slightly underwhelming online offerings, it's easy to see how Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has plenty of road ahead of it."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/a-new-dimension-of-kart-racing">Game Informer - 8.5/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds offers some exciting twists on the tried-and-true kart-racing formula, making for a streamlined experience that wastes no time getting you into the action. Though there’s substantially less content and replayability than its primary contemporary, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is concise and effective in its mission, offering the most well-rounded kart racer of the year."</p>

<p>A free DLC is "coming soon"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Rune Factory Story of Seasons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59cdc253d16c1/rune-factory-story-of-seasons.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> got off to a solid start, with Marvelous revealing the RPG spin-off had already shipped more than 500,000 copies as of August.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, a special collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> has been announced. This will be a free DLC and is "coming soon", so expect "more details" soon.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar was released on the Switch and Switch 2 in August, and we called it the farming series' best remake yet. Guardians of Azuma arrived on both of these platforms in June and we thought the experience was "near-perfect" on the new Nintendo system.</p>

<p>Just breathtaking</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It looks like Square Enix is still celebrating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>'s 30th anniversary — and why shouldn't it? This is one of the most-beloved RPGs of all time.</p>
<p>And today, as a tasty little treat, the company's Japanese YouTube channel has shared a video showcasing close-ups of some of the game's character art and promotional artwork. (thanks to modder and video producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohpoorpup.bsky.social/post/3lz7edbj5mc2f">Christa Lee for highlighting</a>!)</p>
<p>The video appears to be a behind-the-scenes look at Square Enix's reproductions of the late, great Akira Toriyama's artwork. Individual characters, the campfire scene, and the battle scene that graces the game's North American box art are among the works shown off.</p>
<p>As for the reason? Well, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/novacrystallis.com/post/3lz5zz4bwxc2s">according to Nova Crystallis</a>, this is all for a social media campaign that Square Enix is holding. If you follow the company's <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1968885383627948195">Japanese account on X</a> (formerly Twitter) and respond with your favourite character along with the appropriate hashtag, you'll be in with a chance of winning a piece of art.</p>

<p>It looks like the competition itself is exclusive to Japan, but honestly, the video itself is also a great way of seeing these pieces of iconic art in 2160p, 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The colour and the linework is absolutely beautiful, and we're honestly jonesing to get a piece of that art for our offices...</p>

<p>Earlier today, Square Enix also announced the 'CHRONO TRIGGER Piano Soundscape Arrangement' album, which launches in Japan on 26th November 2025 for 3,300 yen (plus tax). With 12 newly-arranged songs, largely focusing on character themes, this is a must for fans of the iconic score, we think.</p>
<p>Let's hope even more Chrono Trigger celebrations are on the way.</p>
