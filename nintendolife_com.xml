<figure><a title="Xenoblade / Days of our Lives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0dcf8f1da785/xenoblade-days-of-our-lives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The long-running American soap opera <strong>Days of Our Lives</strong> has made headlines recently after one of its regular characters name-dropped <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong>, of all things.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407">Nintendeal</a> on X (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-cant-believe-a-days-of-our-lives-character-just-name-dropped-a-mid-tier-rpg-franchise-while-flirting">IGN</a>), the moment occurred when Aaron Greene attempted to invite Arianna Horton into his room by asking if she wants to "come play Xenoblade on my Switch". Looking like she just couldn't let the poor guy down, Arianna actually agreed and said "wow, uh, yeah, yeah sure".</p>

<p>It's not the first time a Nintendo franchise has been name-dropped in a TV show, and nor will it be the last, but usually it's the likes of Mario or Zelda that are the go-to franchises for something like this.</p>
<p>Here, however, the fact that Xenoblade is name-dropped indicates that the writer of this particular scene may be a fan; or at the very least is aware of the RPG series from developer Monolith Soft.</p>
<p>It's gone down well with fans, regardless, with user <a href="https://x.com/ZhenghuaYang">Zhenghua Yang</a> stating "This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned. Top tier marketing."</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67642939e169b/mario-kart-world-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that Europe will soon be treated to its very first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> online event, as it lifted the lid on the '<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/September/Take-part-in-the-first-ever-Mario-Kart-World-European-online-event--2914655.html">European September Circuit</a>'.</p>
<p>This online competition will get off the start line on <strong>27th September</strong>, running from <strong>5pm BST - 7pm BST (6pm CET - 8pm CET)</strong>. It'll see participants speeding through a series of 150cc VS Races, all in the hopes of keeping their Versus Ranking as high as possible. Each player will start with a Versus Ranking of 3,000 points, which will go up or down depending on race outcomes, and one the two hours are up, that ranking is locked in.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like a bit of you, you can take part by following the instructions below. A Switch 2, Mario Kart World and active Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required to participate, but you lovely lot knew that already, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the Mario Kart World main menu and select 'Online Play'</li>
<li>Hit '-' to search for an event and enter the Event ID <strong>1023</strong></li>
<li>Once the confirmation has gone through, you're in!</li>
</ul>
<p>One week after the event wraps up, Nintendo will publish a leaderboard of the 100 highest-ranked players from the European September Circuit. There's no <em>prize</em> for the winner, as such, but the bragging rights speak for themselves.</p>
<p>A similar event cropped up in Japan last month, with the '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mario-kart-world-announces-summer-vacation-skill-test-event">Summer Vacation Skill Test</a>' similarly putting drivers through their paces. Let's hope we see more friendly competition in the future.</p>
