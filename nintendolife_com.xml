<p>Following its release on Switch and Switch 2 last December</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="15948a6745072"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15948a6745072/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There was some shock earlier this week when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/heres-a-look-at-the-best-selling-switch-and-switch-2-games-so-far">Nintendo's financials</a> seemingly confirmed that neither the Switch or Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> had cracked one million sales. So, how about the combined figures?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File journalist Stephen Totilo</a> has now reached out to Nintendo and got an official confirmation from a representative that the "combined sales" of the two titles have surpassed the one million mark. Here's the message relayed on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following some consternation yesterday about neither the Switch nor Switch 2 versions of Metroid Prime 4 (Dec. 4) making Nintendo's million-seller list for the period ending Dec 31, a Nintendo rep confirmed to me today that the combined sales of those 2 versions have in fact passed a million copies"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceoqhusm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Nintendo hasn't released the exact sales figures for either version, or the combined figures in this case, but this latest update likely puts these sales more in line with the typical performance of the Prime series, even if the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-sales-have-got-off-to-a-slow-start">individual releases got off to a slow start</a>.</p>
<p>The side-scroller entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, which released on the Switch in 2021, is currently the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> series' best-selling game, with over three million sales. As for how Beyond stacks up against <em>other</em> Prime releases, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> game remains the most successful entry, and the more recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Remaster</a> on the Switch was able to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230509_4e.pdf">surpass the million mark</a> in a matter of months.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not known if Beyond has actually met Nintendo's sales expectations at this early stage, and there are many other factors to consider, including the title's lengthy development cycle, its cross-generation release, and a launch window in one of the busiest years on record for Nintendo - with the Switch 2 just getting started.</p>

<p>The Heavy, Max and the rest of the gang are back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Here's a blast from the past! Developer Skunkape Games (the team founded by former Telltale employees who revived the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sam_and_max_the_complete_trilogy">Sam &amp; Max</a> series) has today announced the return of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/poker_night_at_the_inventory">Poker Night at the Inventory</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This poker title featuring an all-star cast of video game characters (Max - Sam &amp; Max, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/strong_bad_episode_1_homestar_ruiner">Strong Bad</a> - Homestar Runner, Tycho - Penny Arcade and The Heavy - <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong>) was originally developed by Telltale Games for Steam in 2010 and was delisted in 2019.</p>
<p>The new version has been "lovingly remastered" and will be reopening its doors for Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>. Players can expect overhauled graphics and lighting, along with gameplay fixes to improve the overall poker simulation.</p>
<p>There are also new unlockables (including the return of TF2 items on Steam) and quality-of-life features - with the game updated using the "same engine as the team's recent remasters of the Sam &amp; Max trilogy". Here's some additional information via the Steam listing, and you can check out the official trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently reopened following a seismic retrofit, the Inventory is once again the hottest gathering place for video game characters to unwind after a long day on the job. Drop in to play No Limit Texas Hold’em with four familiar faces: Max, Strong Bad, Tycho, and The Heavy.</p>
<p>From the archives of Telltale Games, this jokey poker game pits iconic characters against the Player (that’s you!) in a high-stakes battle of cards, bets, and trash talk.</p>
<p>Each tournament you win brings you closer to unlocking a new hidden table design or custom card deck, each with new art unique to one of your opponent’s home franchises. Some of the decks and table felts have hidden properties that change the look of a character at the table, or the game itself. Keep an eye out for new unlocks created just for this release.</p>
<p>The Inventory and its guests look better than ever, with a top-to-bottom visual refresh, featuring higher resolution models, a more detailed environment, crisper animation, and new lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to tuning how much table talk you want to hear, you can now change the starting buy-in amount to literally raise or lower the stakes. There are also some new graphics features to up the filmic ambiance, like optional cinematic motion blur and film grain (they're off by default).</p>
<p>The team stripped Poker Night’s original poker code down to parts, scraped the gunk away, and rebuilt it better than new. Poker Night at the Inventory now plays a far more accurate game of poker, and your opponents will make more informed decisions that better fit their play style and personality.</p>
