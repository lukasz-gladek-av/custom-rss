<figure data-uuid="2f35e20433ff4"><a title="Switch OLED" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f35e20433ff4/switch-oled.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-10-07T14:45:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 7th Oct 2025, 3:45pm</time>]:</strong> If you cast your mind back to last November, you might recall Nintendo of America was on track to pick up another lawsuit win after accused Switch "pirate" James 'Archbox' Williams failed to plead or defend himself when called to do so in court. The case 'entered default', granting NOA the right to take the full requested amount in damages as a result, though we didn't know what the final sum would be. Until now, that is (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3m2f3jyovbe2a">@OatmealDome</a>).</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">updated court document</a> dated 24th October 2025, Nintendo concludes that it is seeking $4,500,000 (roughly £3,355,000) in damages from Williams and a permanent injunction to prevent the defendant from piracy again.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sjzowr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>One section of the document reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOA has been, and continues to be, damaged as a direct and proximate result of Williams’ conduct. NOA has reason to believe that Williams has engaged in the infringing and unlawful reproduction and distribution of hundreds or thousands of copyrighted Nintendo Switch Games, and that through the various Pirate Shops, he has distributed or facilitated the distribution of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of unauthorized copies of such Nintendo Switch Games. NOA also has expended and continues to expend significant resources to halt or stem video game piracy, including through developing, implementing, and updating its TPMs and policing and investigating reports of piracy such as Williams’.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the document, Williams has remained silent on the matter. NOA states that it was contacted by a lawyer claiming to represent the defendant back in January 2025 with a message that read “Mr. Williams understands that Nintendo may have a right to obtain documents in support of its motion for default judgment”, though there has been no further communication in the months since.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Williams will pay up to Nintendo's demands, but the Big N is showing no signs of backing down any time soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/nintendo-files-two-new-lawsuits-in-continued-clamp-down-on-switch-piracy">dished out a handful of lawsuits</a> in its continued clampdown on Switch piracy. Four months on, one of these legal claims has come back as another win for Nintendo after the defendant failed to plead or otherwise respond within the court's given time.</p>
<p>The case in question was against James 'Archbox' Williams, the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit, who Nintendo accused of offering "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games" via several "pirate shops".</p>
<p>According to the initial case, Williams was a self-confessed "pirate" who had previously publicly stated that he "[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game”. The lawsuit (as shared by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-archbox.pdf">TorrentFreak</a>) saw Nintendo request "actual or maximum statutory damages" for several violations should he be found guilty.</p>
<p>However, no such ruling has had to take place. In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.18.0.pdf">new court document</a> filed by the Superior Court of the state of Washington on 8th November, it was revealed that the case has now 'entered default' after Williams "failed to plead or otherwise defend within the time prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil<br>
Procedure".</p>
<p>A default judgment can be reached early on in legal proceedings if the defendant fails to take the required actions. In this instance, the claim can be passed without a court hearing, usually granting the claimant the full requested amount plus interest and costs.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.15.0.pdf">accompanying more detailed document</a> from Washington's District Court explains that Williams responded to a Nintendo cease and desist letter in March 2024 stating that he would "'comply and cooperate with any demands or requests . . . within [his] control' but denying any infringement of Nintendo’s intellectual property".</p>
<p>Nintendo then sent a court order to the same address (and another possible abode that the document describes as the "Surprise Address"), to which Williams did not reply within the prescribed time. And so we arrive at the default judgement.</p>
<p>The court can set aside this decision if it transpires that Williams <em>did</em> reply to the proceedings or if it rules that Williams has a strong enough defence. But, for the time being, at least, this looks like another line in the 'win' column for Nintendo.</p>
<p>A Nintendo lawsuit submitted around the same time as the Williams case was against <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/pour-one-out-for-the-modchip-seller-facing-nintendo-in-court-alone">modchip seller Modded Hardware</a>. This claim is now progressing to the next stage, with the alleged owner of the store, Ryan Daly, standing self-represented in court.</p>

With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-missions-and-rewards-october-2025-dk-bananza-dlc-mario-galaxy-mario-party-3-marios-super-picross">Nintendo Switch Online Missions &amp; Rewards Program</a>, you can nab some rather unique icons for your Switch profile.</p>
<p>Now, you <em>could</em> grab some icons for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party_3">Mario Party 3</a> — and they're quite nice, too — but have you seen those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a> icons? No? Well just look at them! (Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/IconsNSO/status/1975373237623418889">NSO Icon Alerts</a> for highlighting them!)</p>
<p>These icons, shown below, are part of the monthly Play &amp; Redeem scheme for NSO members. All you have to do is boot up Mario's Super Picross on the SNES app and then you can purchase those icon elements using Platinum Points.</p>
<p>It doesn't even take 10 seconds if you have the SNES app downloaded already, so if you like 'em and you have the points... What's stopping you?</p>
<figure data-uuid="4311ccd07c8f1"><a title="Mario's Super Picross NSO Icons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4311ccd07c8f1/marios-super-picross-nso-icons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario's Super Picross was added to the Nintendo Classics service (formerly Nintendo Switch Online) back in 2020. Acting as a direct sequel to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/marios_picross">Game Boy original</a>, this one is largely the same, except once you beat the first level, you'll have access to Wario's version of the game, where you have additional rules to consider.</p>
<p>The game only launched in Japan on the Super Famicom, though it did launch on the PAL Wii and Wii U Virtual Console stores in 2007 and 2013 respectively.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Switch Online release is available to everyone. Plus, If you have a Switch 2 (or a USB mouse) you can actually play it with mouse controls, too!</p>

<p>But what could it mean?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a surprise new short film called '<strong>Close To You</strong>' and it's... not what we expected from the House of Mario.</p>
<p>Initially shared on the Nintendo Today! app before cropping up on YouTube and socials, the short follows a baby that learns to take its first steps via the magic of a sentient dummy (or pacifier, if you'd rather).</p>
<p>It feels very Toy Story, and the animation style has big Pixar energy to boot, but the strangest part of it all is how it feels very... un-Nintendo. There's no Mario to seen, the baby doesn't stumble past some Joy-Con at any point, there's not even a Pikmin cameo.</p>
<p>Or is there? It feels to us like there's something missing in this short. Don't you get the impression that we <em>should</em> be seeing something carrying the dummy or pushing the blocks? Do we spy something moving under the bed in the background <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsufGY5I8jA&amp;t=99s">around 1:38</a>? Doesn't the music sound a little <em>too</em> Pikmin-coded?</p>

<figure data-uuid="d1d7a901a905b"><a title="Nintendo Close To You Zoom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d1d7a901a905b/nintendo-close-to-you-zoom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The whole thing has a whiff of an invisible Pikmin scheme to us, but hey, that's just a theory. Whether this turns out to be something bigger, well, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>
