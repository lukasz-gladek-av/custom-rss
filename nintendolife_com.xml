            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It feels like just yesterday that Revolution Software's classic point-and-click adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars</a>, was 'reforged' on Switch 1. It was, in fact, a year ago (almost to the day), but that hasn't stopped the studio's reforging efforts. The reforged has been reforged, you could say, as Shadow of the Templars has today arrived back on the eShop as a fancy new Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>The catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> popped up on the eShop this morning, where it is now available to pick up for <strong>€29.99/$29.99/£24.99</strong> as standard, or as a <strong>€4.99/$4.99/£4.99</strong> upgrade pack for all those with the Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>As you might expect from a point-and-click, the big addition this time around is Mouse Mode. Yes, the Joy-Con 2 can be flipped sideways and used to add an element of precision to your pointing and clicking. The resolution has also been boosted up to 4K in Docked Mode, and 1080p in Handheld, so you can soak up all the gorgeous 'reforged' art.</p>
<p>"Using the mouse feature is arguably the way that [the game] was always intended," Revolution's co-founder, Charles Cecil, told us recently when we sat down to talk all things Broken Sword on Switch 2, "a lot of the criticisms that were made quite rightly on release last year have since been addressed and obviously go into the Switch 2 as the native version".</p>
<p>It's all a case of bringing the team's vision of the original '90s release to life, as Charles told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What we wanted to do is be absolutely true to the original intent, because we promised fans that this was going be the same game, but enhanced. So what we really focused on was what existed at the time.</p><p>

For the sprites, we went back to the original character sheets that were drawn back in 1996, interpreted them and then brought those across to the low-resolution sprites that had been upscaled and redrew them all.</p><p>

We looked back at Tin Tin characters, and went, 'yeah, that's the kind of thing that we want' because in an adventure game, you want very expressive characters, you want the gameplay to flow through how the characters behave and how they look, so that the puzzles become logical.</p><p>

As far as the backgrounds are concerned, we pretty quickly went back to the original line art, which I had scanned in a very high resolution, and our digital artists then painted over that. But everything was intended to be in 4K. That's what we painted it to be.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>And just in case this will be your first run-in with Shadow of the Templars, here's a brief rundown of what you can expect, courtesy of Revolution Software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Step out onto the streets of Paris as American tourist George Stobbart finds himself embroiled in a mysterious journey of intrigue and jeopardy.<br>
- Enjoy a globe-spanning adventure, exploring exotic locations, solving ancient mysteries, and thwarting a dark conspiracy to reveal the secret truths of the Knights Templar.<br>
- Voyage through the game's iconic locations illustrated in beautiful 4K on Nintendo platforms for the first time.<br>
- Listen to enhanced audio as Revolution delivers the finest, most stunning version of George and Nico's original adventure to date.<br>
- Switch between the original 1996 version of the game and the new reforged visuals at the click of a button.<br>
- Play the game the way that you want to - choose between a ‘traditional mode' for people who enjoy adventures the way they used to be, and a ‘story mode' for those who want subtle hints to ensure they never get frustrated.<br>
- Switch between Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, touchscreen, and controller play styles whenever you choose..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll be sharing more of our discussion with Charles in the coming days, so keep an eye out for details on all things Broken Sword on Switch 2.</p>

<figure data-uuid="31542b1164f6d"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Details" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31542b1164f6d/mario-galaxy-movie-details.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has revealed our first proper look at <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong>, with a trailer that lasts all of 2:25. Nope, that's not very long, but there are a lot of details crammed in there.</p>
<p>To make sure you caught all of the little touches, we've assembled the following rundown of every neat detail, reference, and callback we spotted in the first 'Mario Movie 2' trailer. So, get your fine-tooth combs at the ready, and let's tackle this sucker frame by frame...</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, here's the trailer in all its glory if you want to catch up on the whole thing:</p>

<p>All good? Let's crack out the 'caps...</p>
<h2 id="everything-you-missed-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">Everything You Missed In The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer</h2>
<p>We'll work through the trailer chronologically, starting with sweet little Bowser in his sweet little castle...</p>
<h3 id="mario-x-the-scream">Mario X The Scream</h3>
<figure data-uuid="488024737cdac"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/488024737cdac/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A funny little one to start. It seems that Bowser is a bit of a proto-expressionism fan, as his painting of a particularly bony Mario bears an uncanny resemblance to Edvard Munch's '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream">The Scream</a>'.</p>
<p>It also has a similar appearance to the 'shocked Mario' pose in the first movie's plumbing commercial, but we prefer to think that Bowser is a fan of the classics.</p>
<h3 id="koopa-clown-car">Koopa Clown Car</h3>

<p>We might not get a look at the movie rendition, but one of Bowser's background paintings reveals that Bowser Jr's iconic Koopa Clown Car <em>is</em> a thing in the Mario Movie universe. Just look at how happy the little guy is in his flying machine!</p>
<h3 id="launch-stars">Launch Stars</h3>
<figure data-uuid="db7ad5c3ef939"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db7ad5c3ef939/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the trailer, we see Peach and Toad head off into space via a Launch Star — the mode of transport that anyone who has played either of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy</a> games will be very familiar with.</p>
<p>"Onward and upwards," right? Oops, wrong game!</p>
<h3 id="drip-drop-galaxy">Drip Drop Galaxy</h3>
<figure data-uuid="dbf7fe3e7e2d7"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbf7fe3e7e2d7/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, we can't be 100% sure on this, but the Blooper-filled underwater world that we see Peach and Toad travel past looks mighty similar to the 'Drip Drop Galaxy' from Mario's first intergalactic Wii adventure. There appears to be an extra floating palm tree island on the water's surface, but the sandy core and spherical shape immediately brought the 'Giant Eel Outbreak' mission to mind.</p>
<p>There's also a doughnut-shaped planet in the background that vaguely resembles one of the platforms in 'Gusty Garden Galaxy', though we're less sure about that one.</p>
<h3 id="tostarena-sticker">Tostarena Sticker</h3>

<p>It's not just locales from the Galaxy games that will be cropping up in the movie, mind you. We also get a glimpse at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a>'s Tostarena, complete with its upside-down pyramids and sand dunes.</p>
<p>If you really pay attention in one shot, you'll even see that Luigi's bike is sporting a Tostarena sticker, similar to the one you can pick up from the planet's Crazy Cap store.</p>
<h3 id="ninjis-back">Ninji's Back</h3>
<figure data-uuid="28b9afa767f29"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/28b9afa767f29/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ninji has had a bit of a moment in recent years, after appearing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and it looks like the cameos will keep on coming in the Galaxy movie.</p>
<p>Here, we see a bunch of Ninjis getting their buttons kicked in by Princess Peach, which is... more violent-sounding than we intended it to be.</p>
<h3 id="a-giant-casino">A Giant Casino</h3>
<figure data-uuid="8cfcae47eee0b"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8cfcae47eee0b/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That very Ninji fight takes place in what appears to be a giant casino cube, complete with dozens of slot machines lining the walls and a giant roulette wheel on the floor.</p>
<p>Whether it's a callback to the Luigi's Casino minigames in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/super_mario_64_ds">Super Mario 64 DS</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a>, or the Casino Delfino from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, it looks like a cool setpiece.</p>
<h3 id="wonder-bowser-jr">Wonder Bowser Jr.</h3>

<p>Bowser Jr. arrives on the scene and instantly adopts a similar appearance to his Wonder form from Mario Wonder. This appears to stem from a magical paintbrush à la Mario Sunshine (note how it's embossed with Bowser Jr's face this time, not E. Gadd's) rather than a Wonder Flower, but there's no denying that purple skin, green hair and neon face mask fit the bill.</p>
<h3 id="roaslinas-ice-world">Roaslina's Ice World</h3>

<p>We're not entirely sure where Rosalina is holed up at the end of the first trailer, but those buildings in the background look distinctly like the ones found in the 'Rosalina's Ice World' track from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_kart_7">Mario Kart 7</a>, or, at a push, 'Starview Peak' from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The ground doesn't look snowy enough to suggest Illumination has gone whole-hog on this inspiration, but at least the central tower with its magical floating rings appears to have made the cut.</p>
<h3 id="megaleg">Megaleg</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7edf6e52b29a9"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7edf6e52b29a9/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just in case the giant robot seen facing off against Rosalina didn't ring any bells, that's Megaleg, a robotic boss from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, the boss is under the command of Bowser Jr., and based on the soft <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far#mario-movie-2-cast">Safdie</a> tones emanating from it in the trailer, we'd say that same is true of the movie version.</p>
<h3 id="baby-luma">Baby Luma</h3>
<figure data-uuid="536d4a65d8d7a"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/536d4a65d8d7a/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're jumping ahead to the extra little slice of footage from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8">full movie Direct</a> here, but take a look at that tiny Baby Luma listening to Rosalina's story! It has a little dummy!</p>
<p>Gosh, those plushies are going to sell like crazy...</p>
<h3 id="paper-mario-storybook">Paper Mario Storybook</h3>
<figure data-uuid="e0e1ea3ba4e80"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0e1ea3ba4e80/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rosalinas-storybook-from-super-mario-galaxy-goes-on-sale-this-november">Rosalina's storybook</a> itself. Unlike the storybook from the Galaxy games, the visuals here have a certain papery charm. It's almost as if some animators at Illumination have played a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> game or two, no?</p>
<p>Oh, <em>ohhhh</em>, what if the storybook sections of the film are animated like stop-motion papercraft! Perhaps a bit too ambitious, but we can dream.</p>
