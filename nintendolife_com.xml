<p>You may have already played Bad Viking's first game in the 'Strange' series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, a gothically-tinged tale of running a plant shop, but with more than a touch of Lovecraftian business lurking in the shadows. As someone who's a little bored of the more toothless cosy games on the market, I'm always delighted to find something with sinister undercurrents and supernatural goings-on. Also, ritual murder! Not enough cosy games feature ritual murder.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xuvoji&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Strange Antiquities might be more of the same after Horticulture, but it's a great formula. People come in, they tell you their woes, and you use your logical and deductive skills to locate the object on your shelves that will solve their problems.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6842ca14e81eb"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6842ca14e81eb/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The clever thing is that your shelves are filled with a ton of objects that could, potentially, fit the vague description in the book, and it takes careful reading and attention to clues to pick the right one. If you're looking for something made of gold, should you pick the necklace, or the totem? If you need something that represents a lunar goddess, should you pick an item made in her image, or in the shape of the moon? For detective game sickos like me (and you, I bet) who love having to decipher cryptic clues like you're trying to ask Rumpelstiltskin for directions, this is basically catnip.</p>
<p>Strange Antiques also has that rare quality of making the player feel masterful, which is hard to achieve, because the player usually has absolutely <em>zero</em> experience doing whatever it is the game's about. I love <strong>Ace Attorney</strong>, but I know diddly squat about the law, and although I technically have grown vegetables in my real-life garden, my harvest has never been as bountiful or marketable as those I grow in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've never been a semi-magical purveyor of arcane goods who occasionally explores graveyards and ruins to find more (although if you see a job posting for that, please send it to me), but Strange Antiquities – with all its reference tomes and maps – makes me feel incredibly competent at the task. A customer comes in, says something unhelpfully ambiguous about their ailment, and waits patiently as I comb through my books, cross-reference them with items, and finally settle on an object to give them.</p>
<figure data-uuid="43c04ae1d9981"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43c04ae1d9981/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're not giving out curios and knicknacks, you're exploring, through Strange Antiquities' concise and clever daily riddles. Some of these riddles are presented as text – "An escaped prisoner ran north-west. He hid me in the first building he came to" – which require you to find a location on a map that corresponds to its clues. In that example, you have to find a prison, trace a line northwest, and find the first building on that line. That one's easy, because it's the first one, but it still has that fulfilling sense of reading between the lines that all good detective games cultivate.</p>
<p>Other riddles are more opaque, providing you with nothing but a shape, and hoping that you'll have studied your maps enough to recognise that it's the outline of a house, or a tombstone, or a room. These puzzles need you to notice subtle details, read between the lines, and cultivate an internal spatial understanding of each area, in order to solve the riddle. Asking players to engage with the world on such an intimate level is genius – it creates a sense of player-directed immersion that adds to that feeling of mastery and ownership.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that, in a year dominated by detective-y puzzle-y games, most of which are not on the Switch (boo), I feel like Strange Antiquities has flown a little under the radar. The much-lauded clique of <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong>The Roottrees are Dead</strong>, <strong>The Drifter</strong>, <strong>The Seance of Blake Manor</strong>, <strong>Type Help</strong>, and the various <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rise_of_the_golden_idol">Golden Idol</a> add-ons deserve their praise, but Strange Antiquities deserves to be up there on the puzzle podium with them. It's tough when the competition is so stiff!</p>
<p>So, if you're reading this and you enjoy clues and riddles and all that business, give Strange Antiquities a go (plus Strange Horticulture, if you haven't already played it). And then add it to your Game of The Year list, because it's certainly earned a place on mine. And it's not just because a strange shopkeeper gave me a <em>Purified Amulet Of GOTY</em>. I don't think, anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Hopefully, many of you are enjoying an end-of-year break over the holidays, but even if you're back at the coalface before the new year arrives, we recommend making time to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJvpRGibFhg">this fascinating new overview documentary</a> of the NES' US launch from Frank Cifaldi and the folks over at the Video Game History Foundation.</p>
<p>Building on his years of research, and following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA">the excellent panel</a> at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo back in October (featuring NOA veterans Gail Tilden, Lance Barr, and Bruce Lowry - we'll embed the archived video at the bottom of the page), this new 45-minute video went live on Christmas Day and explores the ins and outs of the Famicom's journey to the US, its transformation into the Nintendo Entertainment System, and how its New York test market launch set the system up for monster success in the second half of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Cifaldi presents a condensed timeline of events, bringing together materials from the VGHF's archive with other sources for a brilliant, fresh look at a story you may think you know well. Starting when an initial deal with Atari fell through, which led to Minoru Arakawa and his Nintendo of America team wondering if they themselves had the means and wherewithal to bring the system to the US, Cifaldi highlights discouraging feedback from various rounds of focus group testing and advice, which NOA thankfully ignored.</p>
<p>Nintendo fans may believe there's nothing new to say about this much-told story, but the VGHF team does a great job of working in new tidbits and putting the record straight on points you <em>think</em> you know.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d2cf678c1256a"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2cf678c1256a/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, yes, Lance Barr headed the industrial design for the Westernised Famicom hardware (using Bang &amp; Olufsen's sleek hi-fi gear as inspiration for the shell), but did you know that the thick 'brick' we all know and love — well, we all know it, at least — was actually the work of NCL's engineers riffing on Barr's efforts?</p>
<p>The team at Nintendo's Japanese parent company, worried about dust getting into the slot of a top-loading console, took Barr's sexier, B&amp;O-inspired design (known as the AVS before it became the NES) and bulked it out massively to include the front-loading cart mechanism. Barr himself was disappointed with the resulting 'lunchbox' when it appeared.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>did</em> know that already, you're guaranteed to find new info in the essay. The 45 minutes fly by, it ties up the opening Atari thread beautifully at the end, and we highly recommend settling down with it between now and the new year.</p>
<p>And if you're so inclined, head over to <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">gamehistory.org/donate</a> to find the VGHF's Winter Fundraiser and support Frank and the team's excellent work.</p>

<p>It's time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Well, not really. The massively popular Switch will live on in a way few other Nintendo consoles have done thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility</a>, a host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free upgrades to existing games</a>, and a Switch 2 form factor that keeps everything about the previous console.

<p>However, assuming the games play as advertised and the upscaling doesn't bork 720p games on Switch 2's 1080p screen, then a great many of us will be retiring our trusty console - or donating it to someone else.</p>
<p>After eight long years, it's an emotional time, so we thought we'd take a look back at the system — or <em>systems</em> (the replacements, the Lites, the OLEDs we've added to the family) — that kept us going since 2017, though good and bad, sickness and health, 'til Switch 2 us part.</p>
<p>Let's take one last look at the Switches Nintendo Lifers will be packing away very soon...</p>
<h2>A life Switch-up (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4c77861eeb56e"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c77861eeb56e/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My floor isn't always this messy... — <em><span></span> Image: Alana Hagues / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's weird to think that I almost didn't get a Switch straight away. I felt burned by the Wii U's launch, so I was tentative about picking up another launch-day console. Then I got home from work on 3rd March 2017 and there was my mum, with a shiny new boxed Nintendo Switch and a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. The Switch was my very first 'adult' console — as in, it was the first new console I owned as an adult. And in the eight years since, I've had two OG models, a Lite, and three different OLEDs.</p>
<p>Those Switches have been my rock. I took my OG to two separate E3s. It was my companion for many plane and train rides. The Switch was there through a break-up, buying my first apartment, through the-year-we-don't-talk-about, waiting for me post-therapy. Importantly, my OLED was there for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_party_superstars">Mario Party</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> sessions during my long-distance relationship, and it's here now after my move to America to live with my partner.</p>
<p>We have two OLEDs between us, so while one will probably be tucked away, the other will stay out for now. I can't quite say goodbye to the console just yet. I may reserve a lot of love for older systems, but the Switch is one of my favourites. I'm not sure I would be doing what I do now at Nintendo Life without the Switch. So, thank you, you lovely little tablet, you.</p>
<h2>Man's second-best friend (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6354d090c70ca"><a title="TEDDY" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6354d090c70ca/teddy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"What you doing, Dad?" — <em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think I've gone through quite as many milestones in life as I have during the Switch's lifespan. Okay, granted, not many console generations have lasted as long as the Switch, but whatever.</p>
<p>Soon after March 2017, I moved into my first house with my then-girlfriend, who became my wife a few years later. We got a dog (Teddy, who some of you will have met in a few Nintendo Direct liveblogs), created a brand-new human, moved into a bigger home, and I started working my dream job here at Nintendo Life. Honestly, I owe the Switch a great deal.</p>
<figure data-uuid="036c05beb3449"><a title="Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/036c05beb3449/switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the 3DS, which wooed me with its excellent custom designs, I've stuck to owning just one of each Switch variant: the OG, the Lite, and the OLED. The original has, until now, festered in the garage after I haphazardly threw it in a box whilst moving house, and unfortunately it no longer charges. A regrettable action on my part.</p>
<p>My Lite has pretty much already gone to my daughter, and while she's still not quite old enough to understand how it all works, it'll be there for her in the coming months and years. As for the OLED, I dunno... I suspect I'll keep it as a kind of backup; something to potentially test out GameShare features in the future, or something. I'm hesitant to let it go.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is... thank you, Switch. Nostalgia keeps the GameCube pretty high up on my list of favourite consoles, but there's no denying that the Switch is probably Nintendo's greatest achievement.</p>
<h2>So long, partner (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9880cdf03ad8f"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9880cdf03ad8f/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yes, that's how shocked I am that it's almost over — <em><span></span> Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It comes as a shock to almost everyone that I tell, but I didn't get my first Switch until Christmas 2017. I was in my first year of uni at the time and, unsurprisingly, I didn't have a lot of spare money lying around to be splashing on the latest Zelda machine. And so, I patiently waited until ol' Saint Nick came a-calling, while the lineup grew and grew.</p>
<p>Over the next three years of studying, the console brought some of my happiest memories: Wrapping up Breath of the Wild in my gross student bedroom rather than dwelling on homesickness; pulling an all-nighter with my housemates to finish a collaborative runthrough of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shaq-fu_a_legend_reborn">Shaq-Fu</a> (of all the games); sweating buckets with pals after a post-exams <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2021">Just Dance</a> party. The Wii was all about giving <em>everyone</em> the chance to play, and the Switch felt like it did it all over again.</p>
<p>That OG model, with its drifting Joy-Con and mysterious scratch on the back, got cashed in shortly after I started here at Nintendo Life and thought it only right to pick up a shiny new OLED to mark the occasion. I've kept this replacement in tip-top condition since, naturally, and will continue to do so long after my Switch 2 arrives.</p>
<p>It's only the threat of recency bias that keeps this wonderful hybrid from the top of my all-time favourite console list (where the DS currently sits), but I can see it sitting in pole position a few years down the line. So long, partner. You've been fantastic.</p>
<h2>An on, off, then fully-back-on-for-the-long-haul relationship (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f73b9ff24354c"><a title="OG Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f73b9ff24354c/og-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, my old mucker, which I haven't cleaned the dust off here for maximum effect. An ancient relic, this piece of early human history is actually my first Nintendo Switch (flanked by its siblings) and it still works. Probably. I'm not going to try it, just in case I release a curse and we have to get Brendan Fraser in (he's expensive since the Oscar).</p>
<p>Back in 2017, my mate got himself a Nintendo Switch and, for one of the first times ever, I decided to hold off a little on a new console launch, playing Breath of the Wild on my trusty Wii U, before finally realising I couldn't deal with the FOMO and capitulating. I then got very bored, very quickly. I'm not quite sure why — hard to remember anything that happened before COVID, innit — but I felt like the Switch wasn't going to be able to pull me away from shinier games on more powerful hardware. What a fool.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bunch of years and Switch, besides having given me a route — through freelance reviews — into my current full-time job at this lovely place, has easily become my favourite console of all time. So many great games, so many cherished family memories (my sons have grown up on Mario Kart 8 and Zelda, which I think we can all agree is the best start in life), it's been the final proof needed for me, as a (pro) gamer, that graphics, raw horsepower, and all that fancy stuff isn't what makes this medium really tick.</p>
<p>So, having said all of those very nice things, you'd think I'd <em>at least</em> be nice enough to dust it, after everything it's done for me. Why am I such a pig? A question for another time, perhaps.</p>
<h2>Gone with the drift (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c5b492959b006"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5b492959b006/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not sure where the biro across the Capture button on that blue Joy-Con came from — <em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've gone through three Switches in eight years. The first, a launch-day department store pickup, was donated to another family member when the better-battery version came out and I couldn't resist the tiniest of upgrades.</p>
<p>Then, when the OLED launched, I ended up swapping the better-battery one for my <em>original</em> launch-day Switch — the one I'd broken in with BOTW across four glorious weekend coach journeys throughout March '17 — which I've still got in the drawer. It's seen better days, and the rails don't hold the Joy-Con very well anymore (the same goes for my OLED), but it's still going.</p>
<p>I can't say what the future holds for them. It would be a shame for that OLED screen to go unused, but until my kids are older, these will probably stay in the drawer. One thing I <em>won't</em> be sad to see the back of is my drifting Joy-Con. I love the multicoloured lineup, but only two of the six pictured above function properly. Hmph.</p>
<p>But let's not let dodgy Joy-Con colour the memory of a little console that's become a part of the family. As with all family members, there's some crunchy with the smooth, but you wouldn't be without them. Goodnight, sweet Switch.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And there we are. We salute these Switches as we commit their tablets to the cupboard.</em></p>
<p><em>Will you be hanging up your S1 Joy-Con completely in a few days? Are you getting a little emotional about bidding this console farewell and getting involved with the new, shiny model? We'd love to hear your journeys with your personal Switches below.</em></p>
