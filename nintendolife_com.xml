            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>This week marks the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> on the Switch 2, and it's packed with a <em>huge</em> cast of characters.</p>
<p>As part of the Zelda Musou's recent launch, the voice actors of many of the characters have now been officially revealed. Fan site <a href="https://x.com/ZeldaUniverse/status/1986445762134155524">Zelda Universe</a> notes how there are a total of 34 English voice actors in this new entry.</p>
<p>This includes the return of Patricia Summersett as Zelda, and talent such as Matt Mercer (known for his role as Ganondorf). You may also recognise other voices like Joe Zieja, who also voiced Claude in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full credits list, and below this are as many announcement messages as we could find on social media. These attach the name (and voice) to each character in the game.</p>

<h3>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Voice Actors:</h3>





















<p>If you're still not sure whether to check out this game, be sure to take a look at our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</em></p>

<p>This is a wild one, folks</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="0a54ee38e4828"><a title="Dragon Power - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0a54ee38e4828/dragon-power-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we checked out the wonderful Animal Crossing: Wild World for the DS and, as expected, the western design won the day with a whopping 84%. Good effort Japan, but this one just ain't it.</p>
<p>This time, we're looking at <strong>Dragon Power</strong> for the NES. Released in 1988, this was a top-down adventure game not entirely unlike Zelda II, in which you would explore environments before shifting to a side-scrolling viewpoint when facing off against enemies. It's said to be based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West in which a kung-fu protagonist is on a quest to recover the Crystal Balls.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11flqirjw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>We've got North America, Europe, and Japan all vying for the prize today, so let's get cracking!</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d388c84d7aea5"><a title="Dragon Power US" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d388c84d7aea5/dragon-power-us.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so this is very typical of those early NES box art designs, right? We've got the protagonist in the bottom left sporting a pretty large foot with teeny, tiny twinkle toes, while the background is mostly covered by a menacing green dragon. Doesn't it look a little familiar, though...?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="765dbbe637db7"><a title="Dragon Ball JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/765dbbe637db7/dragon-ball-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hahaaa, <em>yes</em>! Some of you might have already known, but Dragon Power in the US is actually a Dragon Ball game. Released in Japan as <strong>Dragon Ball: Shenlong no Nazo</strong> and in Europe as <strong>Dragon Ball: Le Secret du Dragon</strong>, the American design basically got rid of all references to the hit manga/anime series.</p>
<p>This cover art features the iconic Goku in the foreground with Bulma and Yamcha in the background, presumably either levitating or running atop the back of the dragon Shenron.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="80009f6568181"><a title="Dragon Ball EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80009f6568181/dragon-ball-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169272-dragon-power">Bandai / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so Europe's design basically features the same artwork as Japan, but we've also got some character portraits in the bottom left, with everything surrounded by a pretty basic blue background. Japan and Europe also share the same art style for the title, and dare we say that North America's approach with this might be a tad better..?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Global Test Ride is currently taking place this weekend, and it looks like the game engine it's running on might have been uncovered.</p>
<p>It's Bandai Namco's new in-house engine SOL-AVES. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1or8w63/kirby_air_riders_appears_to_run_on_the_solaves/">some detective work</a>, the engine's logo has been spotted in the game demo's Intellectual Property Notices. We've taken a look ourselves and can confirm it's listed. The <a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/sol-aves-79369433">trademark for this engine</a> was filed in "late 2024", but it's apparently been in the making since around 2019, and was <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-is-still-working-on-new-in-house-game-engine-update-reveals/">initially revealed in 2022</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytWA6pqBIEskk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Recruitment and training for the engine is supposedly ongoing, and its first major public test appears to be this new title by legendary game director Masahiro Sakurai. Below you can see new engineers testing it out. This new game engine has also previously <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.snar.jp/jobboard/detail.aspx?id=bew5uZn3nmm_5RVLIxMdPg">shown up on Bandai Namco's official website</a> in job listings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco Studios develops its own in-house game engine. As part of their training, new engineers had the opportunity to try out our in-house developed game engine! During the training, after learning the basic operations, the participants created a simple game. The ease of use of the in-house game engine has been very well received."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, Bandai Namco has made use of video game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine for major releases.</p>

<p>Classic building and resource management gets cosy</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're a fan of cosy-style games and don't mind some classic building and resource management sim action, you might be interested in the upcoming Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_rocket_lab">Little Rocket Lab</a>. This game originally made its <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/09/little-rocket-lab-is-a-timed-xbox-exclusive-coming-to-game-pass-this-october?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">console debut in October on the Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>After being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-every-game-from-wholesome-snack-2024-coming-to-nintendo-switch">announced during the 'Wholesome Snack 2024' presentation</a> last December, it seems it might finally have a release date. According to the official store page on Nintendo's website and eShop, it will launch next month on <strong>10th December 2025</strong> for $19.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>This game is compatible with the Switch 2 and will apparently take up 1.8 GB on both Switch systems. Here's the official description, and you can see the original announcement trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You play as Morgan, an aspiring engineer headed home to complete your family's dream project - a rocket ship! Finding home not quite how she left it, Morgan will need to research and build clever contraptions and sprawling factories to help the locals. From simple drills and furnaces to complex assemblers, cranes and miles of conveyor belts, you'll convert local resources into useful materials and bring industry back to sleepy St. Ambroise.</p>
<p>- Build clever contraptions and sprawling factories to solve puzzles and help the town<br>
- Get to know the locals, make lifelong friendships and become the heart of the community<br>
- Research and invent new machines, energy sources and mechanical friends<br>
- Discover a heartwarming story as Morgan, an aspiring engineer with high hopes for town!<br>
- Finally build your family's rocket ship!</p>
<p>Outside of smashing together crazy contraptions, you'll need to mine out resources, explore coasts, railyards, quarries and underground areas - each part of town has its own materials to inspire you! You'll need to complete challenges, incorporate electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, crafting, automate through robotics, and loads more to ensure St. Ambroise returns to its former glory. Are you ready to roll up your sleeves?</p>
<p><em>"Little Rocket Lab is a classic building and resource management sim, set in a cozy village filled with NPCs who want to help... and sometimes hinder. With friendships to rekindle, puzzles to solve and a huge world to explore, everything is in place to make this experience a blast from start to finish."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over on Steam, this title has received "Very Positive" user reviews, so if you're into this kind of game, it might be worth keeping tabs on. It was also released in October for PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>Is Crash finally back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="56093ff1da2ad"><a title="Crash Team Racing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56093ff1da2ad/crash-team-racing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Crash Bandicoot hasn't been sighted for a while now, but Crash fans think they might have spotted something that could be tied to a new game project or at least a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>This development comes from the <a href="https://x.com/BeenoxTeam">official Beenox social media account</a>. Beenox, in case you need a refresher, is the same team that worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> and has also helped out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/1op4zhp/beenox_changed_his_banner_and_crash_appears_twice/">uploaded a banner featuring Crash in a kart</a> and then removed it shortly after. What's interesting about this is it appears to be based on Crash's character model from the fourth outing - a title that was released well after the most recent racing game.</p>

<p>So, that's it for now, but if there are any other significant updates or developments here, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this happens to follow a rumour in October about Crash Bandicoot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-sonic-prime-studio-reportedly-working-on-crash-bandicoot-animation-for-netflix">potentially getting his own animation on Netflix</a>. If you missed it, it's claimed WildBrain Studios - the same team behind Sonic Prime (and also helping out with the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> animated series on Netflix) is behind it. 2026 will also mark Crash's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>For now, the current stories circulating about Crash Bandicoot are just rumours - so nothing has been officially confirmed or announced, and there's no guarantee this discovery will necessarily lead to a new project, reveal or update.</p>
