<figure><a title="Kirby / Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3fe9717829e88/kirby-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Masahiro Sakurai has taken to <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1943507920794325484">social media</a> to provide a small, but welcome update on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> while also paying tribute to Satoru Iwata, the former president of Nintendo who passed away on 11th July 2015.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/masahiro-sakurai-commemorates-kirby-air-rides-22nd-anniversary-and-10-years-since-satoru-iwatas-passing/">Automaton</a>, Sakurai states that Kirby Air Riders is "shaping up to be something great" as he celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> on GameCube. While it's hardly the most detailed update imaginable, it will still no doubt fuel excitement for those looking forward to Air Riders' upcoming release.</p>
<p>Sakurai also recognised the 10th anniversary of Iwata's death, and pondered on how he would soon be the same age as Iwata at the time of his passing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today was the release date of the GameCube's Kirby Air Ride. 22nd anniversary!!</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also the anniversary of Iwata-san's passing. 2015.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed since then…<br>
Iwata-san and I were about ten years apart in age and when we joined the company, and soon I'll be catching up to his age, won't I?</p>
<p>Right now, I'm pouring my heart into making Kirby Air Riders.<br>
It's shaping up to be something great!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirby Air Riders was announced as part of the Switch 2 Direct back in April this year. No further information has been shared, but it's scheduled to launch at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>In what would be one of his final YouTube videos, Sakurai also paid tribute to Iwata in a 'Grab Bag' special, during which he recounted several memories of the legendary Nintendo executive.</p>

<p>No ROMs for you!</p>

<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53beccc0d116e/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A major Switch ROM site – 'nsw2u' – has been seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, nsw2u was one of the better-known repositories of Switch ROMS, which allowed users with hacked Switch consoles to download first and third-party games at will; often before their official release dates. In other words, then, it's a website that Nintendo was probably keen to vaporise quicker than Thanos snapping his fingers.</p>
<p>The full message reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with a seizure warrant issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2323 issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia as part of a law enforcement operation and action by: Federal Bureau of Investigation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo has been very strict in recent years over piracy related to Switch software, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-has-seemingly-taken-possession-of-the-ryujinx-switch-emulator-website">taking possession of the Ryujinx emulator site</a> in 2024 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-is-handed-another-lawsuit-win-after-accused-switch-pirate-fails-to-plead">winning a legal case against the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit</a>.</p>
<p>It's not clear at this stage what might happen with nsw2u in the long run, but we'd wager that the site probably won't be coming back online anytime soon.</p>

<p>Regarding the Switch 2, it became clear soon after launch that those utilising MiG carts would be banned from online services on the console. This <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">drew the attention of Brazil's consumer rights watchdog</a>, who filed a complaint with Nintendo arguing that the latter's policy violates users' rights to access the services that they've paid for.</p>
