<figure><a title="Dark Deity 2 / Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecee49c4a1fc8/dark-deity-2-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Finally receiving a firm release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is one thing, but to hear that it'll be launching in <em>less than two weeks</em> is something else entirely. Yes, after years of speculation, Silksong has finally been confirmed to launch on the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Its mere presence is causing other developers and publishers to run scared, with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/">Aeterna Lucis</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">CloverPit</a> all shifting their release dates to avoid Team Cherry's upcoming behemoth. Demonschool itself had experienced numerous delays during its development, so to see it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">pushed back yet again</a> will no doubt come as a disappointment to prospective players.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lzsvwj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>One developer, however, has pledged to stand firm in the face of Silksong, and that's Sword &amp; Axe. Its upcoming sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a>, is due to launch on the exact same day as Silksong, but in a recent post on X, the developer states that while the Silksong news was "not as fun for me as I had hoped", there are no plans to delay Dark Deity 2.</p>

<p>And y'know what, fair play. It's a risky move, but fan feedback from the post indicates that many have either already pre-ordered the game or will simply purchase it alongside Silksong on the 4th.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">Dark Deity</a> wound up being a pretty solid homage to <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>, earning a respectable 7/10 in our review back in 2022. We said that "the central loop of battling, chatting and levelling up is as compelling as you could ever want it to be, with an interesting story told well and a meaty 20 hours or so of no-frills tactics".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158234/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Though Shantae has become well-established today as a recognisable indie gaming icon, there was once a time when the purple-haired half-genie hero struggled to find an audience. The original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/shantae">Shantae</a> released for the GBC in 2002 and suffered poor sales, which led to publishers being unwilling to pick up the tab for funding the sequel Wayforward had planned for the GBA called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>. Though development had progressed quite a bit, this title was ultimately shelved and interestingly <em>wasn’t</em> revisited when the studio eventually got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/dsiware/shantae_riskys_revenge">Shantae: Risky’s Revenge</a> published for the DSi as the official second game in the series.</p>
<p>Some concepts and mechanics from Risky Revolution were repurposed for later entries, but it wasn’t until 2023 that WayForward revealed it had resumed development on their mascot's lost sophomore outing. And after an initial exclusivity period earlier this year in which the game was only available on an actual GBA cart, WayForward has now brought this interesting piece of Shantae history to modern platforms. After having put it through its paces, I’m happy to report that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Risky Revolution</a> offers up an enjoyable glimpse into Shantae’s past that largely still holds up after all these years.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158239/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Risky Revolution picks up shortly after the end of the first game, with the evil pirate Risky Boots back at it again with another dastardly plan to rule Sequin Land. This time, Risky has obtained technology that allows her to manipulate the tectonic plates beneath the Earth’s surface, plunging Sequin Land into chaos as various towns and locales are suddenly switched into different locations and climates. Aided by longtime allies such as Bolo, Rottytops, and Uncle Mimic, Shantae sets out to round up some of Uncle Mimic’s old colleagues and put a stop to Risky’s antics.</p>
<p>The lighthearted and airy nature of the narrative feels right on brand for the series, showcasing all the wit and humour you’d expect. Whether you’re dealing with wolves obsessed with collecting bad video games or celibate maidens who believe Risky’s mayhem is a punishment for their horniness, there’s a thoroughly unserious theme to the writing here that keeps things moving forward at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Beyond this, Risky Revolution also expertly dances around the lore implications of being the <em>newest</em> entry in the long-running franchise despite chronologically being the second game—there are some aspects here that feel like they don’t <em>quite</em> fit with the broader narrative, but then Shantae canon has always been a little loose.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158238/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay follows the expected Metroidvania blueprint of (most) Shantae games, with you visiting various towns, exploring wide-linear levels packed with baddies to battle and treasures to find, and puzzling your way through Zelda-like dungeons that grant you access to new animal transformations which expand Shantae’s moveset. The main gimmick this time around is Risky’s 'Tremor Engine', which allows you to step on a switch in certain areas of levels that will cause either the background or foreground to cycle and open up new pathways.</p>
<p>This world-cycling mechanic feels like an interesting ‘missing link’ evolutionary step that bridges the gameplay of the original Shantae and Risky’s Revenge, which also played around with having Shantae jump between two different layers of the game world. And while finding exactly what changed about the level and how to access the new pathways can feel a bit confusing at times, this ultimately feels like a clever take on the ‘dark world’ mechanic that a lot of platformers and action games utilise. At the very least, it also helps to set Risky Revolution apart from the other games in the series.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158222/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the Tremor Engine, this is nothing more or less than another enjoyable Shantae adventure that plays exactly how you’d expect it to. Exploration, particularly in the dungeons, is quite rewarding and fuels a rapidly ascending power curve that sees Shantae quickly amassing a host of mobility and offensive abilities that make both combat and navigation a delight. Meanwhile, the combat and platforming are challenging without being too punishing, though the early game can be a <em>little</em> rough given that you have more limited tools and a lot less health to cover your mistakes.</p>
<p>Risky Revolution can also claim to be the first Shantae game to feature a competitive multiplayer feature, which is a fun extra. I was reminded a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/towerfall">TowerFall</a> with this mode, which pits up to four players against each other in an arena and tasks them with knocking each other into spikes. Every now and then, the square arena you’re in will rotate 90 degrees, creating new platforms and opportunities to knock your foes into traps. It’s a little thin on content and obviously is far from the main draw, but battle mode is a fun novelty and helps to round out the overall package a bit.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158237/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a lot of ways, Risky Revolution is a cool time capsule from a different era in gaming, but there are some aspects that haven’t exactly aged the best.</p>
<p>The biggest misstep on the gameplay side of things is the complete lack of a map, which can make navigation and backtracking quite a headache. Though this isn’t what I’d call a <em>huge</em> game world to navigate, it is large and intricate enough that you can easily forget where exactly you saw that out-of-reach collectible, and this issue is compounded by the sections featuring the swappable world. I wouldn’t say that the missing map is a dealbreaker, but it’s certainly an annoyance that keeps this game from ranking among the series’ best.</p>
<p>Beyond this, Risky Revolution also has a tendency to be overly wordy in its character exchanges, which can make some cutscenes overstay their welcome. A personal preference, admittedly, but many of the character interactions have you pressing ‘A’ a <em>lot</em> as you comb through joke after joke without the scene moving forward. Given the already short runtime of this adventure, this doesn’t prove <em>too</em> invasive, but some of the dialogue could’ve been trimmed for an overall tighter script that wouldn’t lose the goofy charm.</p>
<figure><a title="Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158241/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for its graphics, this looks most like Shantae: Risky’s Revenge and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_and_the_pirates_curse">Shantae and the Pirates Curse</a>, characterised by expressive 32-bit pixel art. You also have the option of either playing in Story Mode featuring modern UI elements and HD character portraits, or the more retro Classic Mode, which features the as-is GBA release that came out earlier this year. Both modes look great, though Classic feels a <em>bit</em> more authentic given that its visual elements are consistent with each other.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is an interesting ‘new’ entry in the beloved indie franchise, a curious fusion of old and new design philosophies. Its creative world-cycling gameplay mechanic, sharp 32-bit visuals, densely packed overworld, and charming narrative all come together to make for a worthwhile experience, even if some more outdated elements like the lack of a map hold it back.</p>
<p>I’d recommend this both to series veterans and to newcomers—even if this isn’t Shantae at her greatest, Risky Revolution is a solid adventure.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Hitman 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6e22fe7852fe/hitman-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: IO Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p>IO Interactive has launched a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The key improvement here is the game's frame rate, which at launch failed to maintain its 60fps target at frequent intervals. The patch adds in a 'Frame Rate' option to stabilise the performance, and this will be turned on by default, which perhaps just goes to show how terrible it was before.</p>
<p>There are a few other notable improvements regarding performance and lighting, alongside a particularly concerning issue in which the game would sometimes crash when loading auto saves.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3vrouyk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So let's check out the <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/patch-notes/2025/hitman-woa-nintendo-switch-2-patch-notes-august-26th-2025">full patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patch 3.230.1 – Nintendo Switch 2 (26/08/2025)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Safe to Save -</strong> We fixed the issue causing title crashes when loading auto saves.</p>
<p><strong>Dimmed for Stealth -</strong> Resolved overly bright lighting in dark locations.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror, Mirror (Not So Smooth) -</strong> Fixed an issue where framerate drops could occur when Agent 47 moved while facing large mirrors in bathrooms at 4K resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Blinding Ads -</strong> Fixed an issue where every second ad on display screens in Teller Hall, New York, appeared excessively bright.</p>
<p><strong>Too Bright to Bargain -</strong> Corrected an issue where the Freelancer supplier shop screens would appear overly bright in specific well-lit mission locations.</p>
<p><strong>Trust Your Instincts -</strong> Addressed issues where Instinct would not reliably highlight items, set pieces, or guard silhouettes.</p>
<p><strong>Steady Aim -</strong>Added a “Frame Rate” option to help maintain stable performance. By default, this option is switched on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hitman's performance woes at launch meant that it only managed to score <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">7/10 in our review</a>, despite showcasing the franchise's excellent open-ended gameplay and stunning level design.</p>
<p>IO Interactive is also hard at work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, a brand-new James Bond title confirmed for launch on the Switch 2 in 2026. Meanwhile, Hitman fans can also look forward to a release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> on Switch later this year, with a Switch 2 release to follow in 2026.</p>
