<p>Many of the titles scheduled to appear have yet to receive firm release dates, but Prime 4, Hades II, and Elden Ring are, at the very least, supposedly due to launch at some point this year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xgzirs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In your sights</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>One of the many new features of the Switch 2 is the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode ability. It's already been showcased within the launch window with new and old titles, and later this year, it will be available in Samus' first-person adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>If you are eager to warm up your FPS skills beforehand, it's been confirmed the new Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> this week has added mouse controls. Gyro controls are also apparently supported. Some players have already shared their thoughts about these control options – with <a href="https://x.com/TheEpicManWorld/status/1952956457181139286">some individuals pointing out</a> how you can swap between these controls on the fly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TheEpicMan: "What impressed me is that you can change from normal controls to mouse mode instantaneously! No need to go to the menu to turn it on or off!" (via social media)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from this, Apex Legends seems to have been well-received so far, although you'll need to make some space if you want to play it, as the title is over 78 GB on the Switch 2, according to the official eShop listing.</p>
<p>You can download Apex Legends for free on the Switch 2 (and Switch) and try out mouse mode right now. We've also got a Nintendo Life review for this game on the way, so be on the lookout for that. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> was also recently added to the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' service, and it also includes mouse support.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, there's apparently going to be a "playable" public demo of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>. It will be available next week at the <a href="https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us">Pokémon World Championships 2025</a> – taking place in Anaheim, California between <strong>15th - 17th August, 2025</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsvtigh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Additionally, the same demo will be available to play at Gamescom a week later – between <strong>20th - 24th August 2025</strong>. We don't know the specifics about this demo just yet, or if there's any chance of a demo being made available on the eShop in the future, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Again, if there are interesting details or findings within this demo, we'll let you know. And if there are other demo locations announced, we'll give you the heads up. This follows the release of a new trailer for Pokémon Legends Z-A during the July Pokémon Presents, which gave fans a look at Mega Dragonite and much more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also released kiosks alongside the Switch 2 that feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-demo-spotted-in-the-wild">playable demos of games</a> like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Dead aim</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>I don’t think I’ve ever messed around with a game’s settings menu as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a>. And, unfortunately, try as I might, I could never get the game to feel 'good'. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">its predecessor</a> on the Switch, Forever Entertainment’s latest arcade revamp is limited to just two control schemes: analogue stick and gyro. Neither is an ideal way to play.</p>
<p>But let’s start with the positives. This is a remarkably faithful remake of the 1998 original, maintaining everything that makes the experience so memorable — including wacky boss battles and god-awful voice acting — while providing an extensive overhaul of the visuals. It’s a blast watching zombies’ limbs and guts go flying with each successful shot, and the way the enemy design has been revamped feels both fresh and respectful at the same time.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to get stuck into, including two versions of the campaign — original and arcade — a boss mode, and a training mode that throws you into a variety of challenges. These might entail protecting human NPCs or destroying barrels within a time limit, but it’s all useful in letting you get to grips with how the game plays on Switch.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, back to the control schemes. The gyro aiming, in theory, should be the way to go, but like the first remake, it’s way too erratic. Even when turning the sensitivity down in the settings, I could never hit that sweet spot. Either the reticle would fly off in random directions upon pressing the fire button, or it would inexplicably drift over to one side, requiring you to constantly recalibrate by moving it to the edge before recentring it.</p>
<p>Standard analogue controls feel more accurate, but again, it’s a monotonous exercise in tinkering with the sensitivity to find the setting that feels right. Spoiler: it never felt quite right. Even after landing on a setting that felt reasonably comfortable, the very nature of using an analogue cursor in a light gun game feels incredibly unintuitive. The fact that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/house_of_the_dead_2and3_return">2008 port for the Wii</a> feels better is quite saddening, to say the least.</p>
<p>I should note that the game isn’t horrifically unplayable or anything like that. It’s perfectly serviceable, but a light gun shooter should be instantly playable and fun, and having to constantly fiddle around with the settings to achieve something close to satisfying is definitely frustrating. It's something that developer MegaPixel Studio really should have rectified from the first Switch remake.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I <em>am</em> glad The House of the Dead 2: Remake exists. Control woes aside, I suspect many players will eventually find some enjoyment from the game, provided you're willing to spend considerable time in the settings menu beforehand. It's a fascinating blast from the past, warts 'n' all, and a real showcase of some truly terrible voice acting from the '90s. Just make sure you toggle the 'Mute "Reload!" Scream' option – good lord.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake]]></content:encoded>
