<p>Deep(wood) respect</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We first noticed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/under_the_island">Under The Island</a> almost two years ago, when its debut trailer brought all kinds of happy memories from the glory days of GBA Zelda flooding back. This weekend, Top Hat Studios and Slime King Games showcased even more of their upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">Minish Cap</a>-like, and announced that it'll arrive on Switch on <strong>17th February</strong>.</p>
<p>As you'll see in the above release date trailer (narrated by none other than our good friend Jon Cartwright, we might add), the GBA charm is strong with this one — that opening dungeon looks more than a little like Deepwood Shrine, no? But that's not to say that it's without interesting mechanics of its own.</p>
<p>The top-down adventure game sees you play as Nia, an intrepid explorer who sets out to save Seashell Island from its sinking fate. It's got the usual block sliding and button pressing puzzles that we'd expect to see from a Zelda-like, but we're also particularly interested in the 'Treat Bag' item that we spotted in the above trailer, which lets you befriend or otherwise utilise wild animals' abilities to solve problems. Come on, who doesn't like a smiling pixel art dog?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/UNDER-THE-ISLAND-3017958.html">eShop listing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DISCOVER THE LEGEND OF WHAT'S UNDER THE ISLAND!<br>
Uncover a sinking mystery and step into the role of Nia, a newcomer to Seashell Island - and join forces with local girl Avocado to investigate an ominous fate - the island's destined to sink beneath the ocean! Explore colorful regions, battle strange creatures, and uncover the ancient mysteries that could threaten your new home.</p>
<p>CLASSIC TOP-DOWN ADVENTURE<br>
Journey across a lush island, brought to life with vibrant pixel art and timeless top-down exploration. Delve into hidden corners, uncover secrets, and face dangerous foes across diverse, interconnected biomes.</p>
<p>SIX DISTINCT REGIONS TO EXPLORE<br>

<p>STRANGE ENEMIES &amp; UNUSUAL TACTICS<br>
Face off against vomiting eggplants, tunnelling wolves, and other bizarre creatures. Use artefacts, loot, and new abilities you discover to turn the tide of battle. Befriend animals and see if they can help you on your adventure - particularly if you give them treats!</p>

<p>And it's riding high on Metacritic</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, we can't reach them all as they drop, that's for sure. With so many games releasing at any given time, sometimes things that should and do appeal to our Nintendo sensibilities get lost in the mix. And so has been the case — until now! — with Sleepy Castle Studios and Wing It! Creative's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a>.</p>
<p>This colourful turn-based RPG launched on Switch back on 23rd January, and it's inspired by none other than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> games. Hold on a minute. Mario? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-super-mario-games-of-all-time">We know that guy!</a></p>
<p>Of course, this is far from the first RPG to attempt to emulate the glorious good times of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-paper-mario-games-of-all-time">the best one</a>), but it does seem, judging by the reception so far at least, that this might be a bit of a belter.</p>
<p>Assuming the role of Flynt Buckler, players here are charged with setting off for the HQ (that's a big imposing castle made out to look like corporate offices) of arch nemesis, Tinder. Now that's a scary big baddie name, innit. Here's some more from the game's official blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that storybooks are an untapped market ripe with valuable resources, cheap labor, and profit to be had—so naturally, real-world conglomerate Ever After Inc.™ found a way to intervene! With Tinder’s Castle as their new corporate headquarters, Ever After Inc. is hellbent on taking over every storybook they can. With no choice but to get a job, Flynt Buckler must team up with his former nemesis Tinder in order to climb the corporate ladder and take down Ever After Inc. from the inside!</p>
<p>Fight in a fun, fast-paced battle system that rewards experimentation and strategy</p>
<p>Build and customize your party—every character has unique skills that can be equipped and upgraded throughout your journey</p>
<p>Engage in office banter, help your storybook coworkers, and decorate your office as you climb the corporate ladder</p>
<p>Explore vast storybook worlds brimming with sidequests, treasures, and secret</p>
<p>Stories within stories: experience a charming and lively narrative where the rules are constantly changing</p>
<p>A jazzy, big-band soundtrack that keeps the energy pumping throughout</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judging by the trailer up top, this looks like it nails the graphical style of the Paper Mario games just about right, and then proceeds to do its own thing (thankfully) with plenty of silly references to modern corporate life and other fun to boot.</p>
<p>It's currently sitting on an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/escape-from-ever-after/">82 on Metacritic</a>, and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996390/Escape_from_Ever_After/">"Overwhelmingly Positive" response on Steam</a> with over 500 user reviews at the time of writing. Colour us very interested, indeed!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> has dropped rather substantially from its second-place debut, and now finds itself way down at 17th — just one place behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which has made a surprise rebound this week, we might add.</p>
<p>Of course, this opens things up at the top of the pile, and the usual suspects have slotted in to fill the gap. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> retains the top spot, followed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. No surprises there, then.</p>
<p>Here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>
