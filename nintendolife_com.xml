<p>Better late than never</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>More than five years after its initial console release, the retro FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ion_fury">Ion Fury</a> is finally getting its DLC expansion later this month.</p>
<p>Titled <strong>Ion Fury: Aftershock</strong>, the expansion was originally launched in October 2023 for PC, so it's been pretty much two whole years of waiting for console owners to receive the same treatment. Heck, a full sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phantom_fury">Phantom Fury</a>, has even launched in the interim.</p>

<p>Better late than never though, right? Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Uncharted Territories, Higher Stakes:</strong> Ignite the Fury with a gripping new campaign. Traverse 15 freshly-designed levels teeming with lurking adversaries.<br>
<strong><br>
Fresh Faces of Evil:</strong> Heskel’s been busy. Meet his new lineup of augmented monstrosities itching for a fight.<br>
<strong><br>
Packing More Heat:</strong> Enhance your firepower with new weapons and tools.<br>
<strong><br>
Push Your Limits:</strong> Challenge your skills with the grueling new Angel of Death difficulty level.<br>
<strong><br>
Ride On:</strong> Find out what a rotorcycle is and engage in white-knuckle vehicular combat.<br>
<strong><br>
Old, Yet New:</strong> Immerse yourself in Arrange mode for a fresh new take on all 28 levels from the original 2019 campaign, featuring new areas, new enemy encounters, and more.<br>
<strong><br>
Packed With Content:</strong> Engage in a total of 43 additional levels of sheer mayhem. See Ion Fury through a whole new lens.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Our review for Ion Fury back in 2020 described it as the "time-travelling love letter from the past you’ve been waiting for", praising its challenging combat and intricately designed levels, but noting that the boss battles were uninspired, ultimately awarding it a score of 7/10.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-touryst-deluxe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-the-touryst-deluxe-switch-2-an-upgrade-to-first-class-for-the-return-trip.1318405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like absolutely ages ago that I first reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> on Switch, and returning to it so far down the line, and on the Switch 2 no less, I've been excited to see just how it's held up in the six years since I last took a vacation. Seriously, though.</p>
<p>I was bowled over back in the day, giving Shin'en's adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/touryst">a whopping great 9/10</a>. I loved its voxel graphics and oh-so-lovely controls, its clever puzzles and breezy, beautiful vibes. It's all about the tiny details in this one and, in much the same way as the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a> — also 2019 — the devs (as usual with Shin'en) have got another real looker out of Nintendo's console, with each of the islands you visit presented as gorgeous bespoke miniatures of the likes of Ibiza, with its beach parties, or an idyllic Greek island replete with rooftops to clamber across. Half the fun here really is in just gawping at everything.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:94016 @ 1759842540 -->
<p>There's barely any story to speak of, which perhaps is the game's one drawback (although I'm all for the "let's get down to business" approach sometimes). Each island contains a secret TOWA tower you'll need to uncover and unlock, before heading inside to complete a conundrum or two and obtain a magic core. Collect all cores and deliver them to win the day. As you go, you're entertained by minigames and silly side missions. The Touryst delivers all the good things, without laborious cutscenes or unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>All of this is presented not just in a wonderfully stylish way but in an eminently playable one, too. Your tourist avatar is a capable fellow, despite appearances, with a steady stream of new moves to unlock from the hub island's surf shop. He feels perfect to control as he wobbles carefully and/or speed boosts around locations, and each of the dinky dungeons is so painstakingly crafted that you can't help but be drawn in. Yes, I'm enjoying it all over again.</p>
<p>For this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">Deluxe</a> Switch 2 update, you get an excellent new island to mess on (no spoilers from moi), so more side missions and a whole new tower to explore. It also can't be underestimated how much nicer it looks and plays. No jaggy edges, pristine performance and resolution, and they've added ambient occlusion, improved rain effects, global illumination, and all that fancy stuff. More exciting, though, is the new Fast Zero arcade machine in the game's arcade (a little tribute to Shin'en's excellent anti-grav racers), which you're gonna love.</p>
<p>So, The Touryst: Deluxe gives us Shin'en's excellent 2019 adventure, plus a new island, fun new minigames and missions, and a new arcade game that may well be worth the price of entry alone. With snazzy Switch 2 graphical effects and super smooth performance, it's perfect if you've yet to play it. And with a reduced price point for seasoned travellers — returning players are presented with a 75% discount on the eShop — this is a return trip that's very hard to knock.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-touryst-deluxe]]></content:encoded>
