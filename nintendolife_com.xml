<p>But current memory prices are not an immediate concern</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8e1e52e2c736d"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8e1e52e2c736d/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been the subject of much debate since its launch last year, with many speculating that the current economy might necessitate a price increase for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a>, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa has remained coy on any potential product price increases, simply stating "I cannot comment on hypotheticals". Seems like a pretty understandable statement to make; Furukawa won't want to cause any panic by insinuating that prices may indeed go up.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Kyoto Shinbun article is locked behind a paid subscription model, so the kind folks at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w2yyporceaqxdbzfupn5lcbt/post/3mc5ut4rnmk2f">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> have highlighted some of the key points from the interview. In addition to Furukawa's comment on price rises, he also noted that the current memory prices – which are on the rise thanks to the huge requirement needed for AI chips – will have "no immediate impact on [Nintendo's] financial performance", but he will nevertheless monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>In slightly lighter news, Furukawa confirmed that Nintendo is working on both established franchises and completely new content, which probably won't come a a massive surprise. He also reaffirms Nintendo's desire to expand its work in the movie space, while noting that a potential venture into anime isn't completely ruled out.</p>
<p>We're not surprised to see such vague answers from Furukawa, since getting any sort of comment from Nintendo is like getting blood from a stone. Regardless, it's nice to get at least a <em>bit</em> of context as we head into the new year.</p>

<p>As revealed by the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonJP" tabindex="-1">@SplatoonJP</a> Twitter account, the update is currently planned for a <strong>29th January</strong> arrival, with "balance changes to battles and changes to some battle-related systems" (translated via Google) being the main attraction this time.</p>

<p>We still don't know exactly what 2026 will hold for Splatoon 3. 2024's 'Grand Festival' brought regular updates and Splatfests to an end, though the game stayed alive and kicking throughout 2025 with continuing seasonal events and the surprise release of a free Switch 2 update.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the game received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">PEGI rating for a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, though Nintendo has yet to confirm anything just yet.</p>

<p>Final stream was a speedrun of Pokémon Emerald</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The <strong>Awesome Games Done Quick 2026</strong> event has now closed with a total of <strong>$2.443.554</strong> raised for the <a href="https://preventcancer.org/">Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The week-long fundraiser ended with a speedrun for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Pokémon Emerald</a> by streamer adef, who managed to beat it in 3 hours and 13 minutes. Other highlights from the event include a 70-Star, 70-Player relay for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> and an any% speedrun for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> from streamer Ceen, who stormed through the game to beat the final boss in 54 minutes and 55 seconds.</p>
<p>The next major event, Summer Games Done Quick 2026, will take place later this year from <strong>5th - 11th July</strong>, with donations going to <a href="https://www.msf.org/">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> (Doctors Without Borders).</p>
<p>The charity events have not been without controversy, with the 2022 Summer Games Done Quick fundraiser seeing the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/sgdq-fake">complete ban of speedrunner Mekarazium</a> for faking a run of the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/metal_gear_rising_revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a> DLC. The player had shown a segmented, pre-recorded video of the run rather than playing it live, later admitting to this and receiving a ban from future GDQ events.</p>

<p>While CEO Ryan Rohen eyes up $35 billion pay packet</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7b93f790bb70d"><a title="GameStop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b93f790bb70d/gamestop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The coming of the new year is a good time to take stock and look at the 12 months ahead with a sense of optimism. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/">Polygon</a>, however, GameStop has instead decided to kick off 2026 by shutting hundreds of its stores in the US.</p>
<p>News of such closures apparently came as quite the shock to employees, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/gamestop_really_put_a_trade_coupon_on_my_local/">signs being hastily pasted to storefronts confirming the news</a>. To add insult to injury, the same signs offered up an extra 20% on trade-ins if customers head to alternative GameStop locations.</p>
<p>Many customers have reportedly noted that some store closures have left them with few alternatives, with one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q4vm6i/comment/ny0n4bi/">Reddit commenter</a> stating that their nearest store is now "1.5 hours away".</p>

<p>It's estimated that <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/2025/12/january-2026-reported-closings.html">up to 296 stores closed in the first week of 2026</a>, with even well-performing locations being given the chop. It seems likely that such drastic action is somewhat linked to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm">recent announcement</a> that CEO Ryan Cohen could bag a pay packet worth an astonishing $35 billion, but only if the retailer is able to reach a market cap of $100 billion.</p>
<p>This is roughly ten times its current value at $9.3 billion, so it's a pretty wild target. The announcement clarifies that Cohen "receives no guaranteed pay—no salary, no cash bonuses, and no stock that vests simply over time", with the compensation being entirely "at-risk".</p>
<p>It's not a case of "all or nothing", mind you, with Cohen's compensation available in nine tranches (or 'portions'). The first is available if GameStop achieves a market cap of $20 million, with each subsequent tranche requiring an addition $10 billion in value all the way up to £100 billion. So even if GameStop only manages to reach £20 million, Cohen will still earn billions in shares.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores">RNZ</a>, GameStop is also considering ending its EB Games business in New Zealand, which would mean the closure of 38 stores in the region. According to the notice sent to employees, the proposal is "not final, and no decision will be made until we have completed a full consultation process in good faith with affected team members."</p>
