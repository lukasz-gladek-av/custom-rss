<p>I know, the 'precog' machine in that particular movie wasn't really a 3D printer, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2n7SXUM9m0">Tom's wee red balls</a> seemed to be made of some sort of weird wood rather than filament, but it was the same sort of magic inside my simple mind, and the first time I'd considered a machine that could create a fully 3D object in this way. So the two are forever connected, I'm afraid.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ntroqh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that I am the owner of a 3D printer, now that we live in the actual future, and not that far off from where Tom Cruise and his wee red balls (and that really angry dude with the blonde hair) exist, I have to say, it feels rather mind-blowing to be able to create so many <em>things</em> so very readily.</p>
<p>I'm excited, is what I'm trying to say, and as a very excited gamer, you can bet your bottom Rupee that the first thing I've done with my precious new printer is dive headlong into a whole new world of knocking out my own accessories and smart little bits and bobs for my beloved Nintendo consoles. Oh yes, my sweet babies, daddy is going to take care of you now, you better believe it.</p>

<p>Sorry. Yes. I've been busy pumping rolls of filament into a big noisy machine that's currently located in my sitting room (*cries in wife*), browsing all of the sites and taking all of the notes on the best unofficial docks, grips, cartridge holders (and lots more) that are currently out there for 3D-printing fiends.</p>
<p>So, without any more nonsense, let's get on with taking a look at some of the best I've found and printed thus far, shall we?</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="a-quick-lesson-in-3d-printing-jargon">A quick lesson in 3D printing jargon</h2>
<p>To be as helpful as possible to anyone who might be browsing for something to 3D-print, I'll be dropping the time it takes to print off each of the objects I've made, as well as how much filament I've used to create each one. So, let's talk about a few simple things first.</p>
<p>There are different types of 3D printer out there. You could go with a resin one, which I have heard does <em>slightly</em> better fine details on models, or, like me, roll with a filament machine. This was an easy choice in my case as I have a busy house and some companies, such as Bambu Labs (other brands are available, but it's <a href="https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?srsltid=AfmBOor04U7NzjPojHuBAs55yckzd5ur_qvEiSJKtOYVuLfRRA9SpSYS&amp;id=578772891943051270">Bambu Labs' P1S with AMS</a> that I'm using here) have got a sort of Apple design aspect going on that makes it so you can have a printer in your house and it almost looks nice, and without any unreasonably bad mess or fuss. Well, it's a bit noisy sometimes, but not so much that it keeps me awake on a night print.</p>
<figure data-uuid="68c258caaa1d0"><a title="3D Printing Guide" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68c258caaa1d0/3d-printing-guide.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Filament is bought in rolls of colour ranging from bog-standard to fancy with reflective textures, wood effect, glow in the dark, holographic - basically anything you can think of. There are also different types, grades and levels of filament for different jobs. Oh, and you can change out your printing plate for different textured finishes on your plastic creations, too. So maybe you'll want a brick-grid one for Mario walls, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>For the models below, I'm keeping everything as cheap as possible, using basic PLA filament from a generic brand, but you could also grab PLA+ and onwards and upwards into tough and hard-wearing varieties, or go in other directions for the appropriate material to build, for example, a light and flexible insole for your shoe.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-find-the-designs-to-print">Where to find the designs to print</h2>
<p>All of the designs I've used can be found at <a href="https://makerworld.com/en">Makerworld.com</a>, or you can also grab them off the Bambu Handy app, if you've already got that installed on a device, and I'll drop links to the creations as we go through them as well!</p>

<h2 id="all-the-best-stuff-ive-3d-printed-so-far">All the best stuff I've 3D-printed so far</h2>
<h3 id="mario-warp-pipe-controller-stand-with-storage-for-7-game-carts">Mario Warp Pipe Controller Stand (with storage for 7 game carts)</h3>

<p>This was my first Switch-related print, and it's a belter!</p>
<p>A nice, easy first print to get started, with no complications such as adding supports or any of that nonsense. This controller holder includes the warp pipe itself along with a smart little insert which can manage a grand total of seven of your precious Switch carts.</p>
<p>I had no green filament left when I printed this off, so I've gone with an orange one, but I will be painting it gold very shortly with some acrylic paint! Yessir. SPECIAL PIPE.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 1 hour 48 minutes<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 64g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1502329-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-stand-warp-pipe#profileId-1571705">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Stand Warp by @Dave_D_W -</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-snap-lock-grip">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Snap Lock Grip</h3>

<p>I actually wanted one of these, and so instead of stumping up a wad of cash-cash-money, I've quickly knocked out this very impressive alternative.</p>
<p>There's not much that can go wrong with this sort of design, except perhaps the smaller attachments that keep the Joy-Con in place, but there were zero issues and it's a great fit. In terms of toughness and look/feel, it's also just as good as anything I'd likely find in a store.</p>
<p>To use, you hook on the left and right locking grip, by attaching to the top and bottom of your Joy-Con, then insert the controller into the main body of the grip to push the lock in there permanently. You can now easily click your Joy-Con in and out. Also, it's really light grip, so bonus points for comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> Main Body takes 1.2 hours, whilst the left and right locking grips are 10 minutes each<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 25g for the main body, and 10g per grip lock, for a total of 35g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1514088-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-snap-lock-grip?from=search#profileId-1586658">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con Snap Lock Grip By Manabun Lab</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-game-display-storage-10-slot-version">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game Display Storage - 10 Slot Version</h3>

<p>This very useful display storage is well worth printing out for any serious (and very professional) Switch gamer, such as myself, as not only can it hold lots of lovely game cases and some carts at the front (with gaps so you can see their stickers!), it can also be added to a clever wall-mounted system - for which you print off a few extra parts.</p>
<p>Also, the size can be adjusted from a 4-case holder all the way up to a big 18 model. So there's lots of choice here, and you can add to the storage over time. I've gone with the 10 slot version for this print, and I'll be honest, I should have gone with the 4 because I'm a <em>very</em> futuristic man who is almost 100% digital on the Switch game front these days. Physical media is Dickensian in my eyes. That's right, take your 'cartridges' out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 2hrs 50mins<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 92g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/931008-nintendo-switch-1-2-game-display-storage?from=search#profileId-1077875">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game Display Storage By AkiPrint</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-zelda-royal-crest-dock-cover">Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda 'Royal Crest' Dock Cover</h3>

<p>Why waste time printing off an entire dock when you can just make a faceplate to hide the unrelenting grim blackness (looks dark grey to me, to be honest) of Nintendo's vanilla offering? This is my biggest print thus far, clocking in at 6.5 hours and costing 204g of tasty filament, but the result, especially if you choose a snazzy filament or paint the result, is well worth it!</p>
<p>There are tons of cool Nintendo-themed plates and docks to choose from out there, and you could go crazy with fancy filaments such as gun metal and realistically shiny gold to really make this Zelda one pop off. Also, the design I've printed off here, which I've linked to below, has a whole bunch of other covers to choose from once you click into its printing screen.</p>
<p>As you can see, I've been a right bore and gone with the classic option, but you can be damn sure I'll be firing up 'Auld Betsy' later to print myself off a Yiga Clan one.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 6hrs 30mins<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 204g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1496627-nintendo-switch-2-zelda-cover?from=search#profileId-1618423">Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda Dock Cover By Nana.Printland</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-mini-game-cases">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Mini Game Cases</h3>

<p>What's better than having a whole bunch of Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves? I'll tell you what, having a whole bunch of <em>mini</em> Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves. Mate, that's what.</p>
<p>These may, at first glance, seem as though they are meant to be more for fun than anything else. However, they do also provide some much-needed protection. In fact, they are actually a great space-saving idea if you usually cart your cases around when going mobile.</p>
<p>One thing with these: the basic PLA I used seemed a little brittle at first, but the edges do soften up when you bend them, then you're free to add any covers you want to print off and add.</p>
<p>As you can see, I ran out of time on decorating this one, but jump to the link below to see how amazing a printed cover makes them look. Oh, and that all-important click as you snap the cat into place is reassuringly present.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 19 minutes per case<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 8g per case<br>

<h3 id="switchrest-car-headrest-mount-for-switch-2">SwitchRest Car Headrest Mount For Switch 2</h3>

<p>When I'm out and about and being driven around by either my wife or children, I like to recline fully in the back seat and make full use of my time by playing my beloved video games whilst yodelling loudly. No talking when daddy is playing his games and yodelling, please. Not unless you're offering me a snack. Thanks.</p>
<p>So, given my life preferences, it seems obvious that I might want an in-car Switch console holder. Of course I do. And this one is nice and quick and very straightforward to print, too!</p>
<p>There are lots of designs for car holders out there, and some of them get very fancy with retro NES looks and so on. However, the way this one hooks on is, perhaps, one of the better designs. It's very solid and secure as it hooks onto the fully extended kickstand, holding the console firmly in place. Oh, and it just happens to take way less time and materials than most of the rest.</p>
<p>Now I can combat boredom as my wife drives me to the local sweet shop by indulging in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/race_with_ryan_road_trip_deluxe_edition">Race With Ryan</a> in the car. Hey, it feels like I'm really driving!</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 51 minutes<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 31g<br>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-multi-game-case-mario-mushroom-edition">Nintendo Switch Multi-Game Case (Mario Mushroom Edition)</h3>

<p>These delightful little containers hold four game carts and are absolutely fantastic quality when you see them finished off. The twisting mechanism on the top here actually surprised me with how robust and smooth it is. These will 100% properly protect and take care of your carts.</p>
<p>What's more, as with anything else you 3D print, you can change the size, so you could have a giant version, a 50% scaled-up version or whatever you fancy. There is also, of course, the opportunity to go wild with colours, matching all in-game types and maybe doing some weird trippy ones while you're at it. Hey, they are mushrooms, amirite? Hello? Mario?</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 3 hours per mushroom<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 38g<br>

<h3 id="articulated-ancient-guardian">Articulated Ancient Guardian</h3>

<p>Okay, so I cracked and decided to do some less useful items, one of which is an articulated Guardian that, I'm not gonna lie, I might actually be fully in love with.</p>
<p>Articulated figures such as this, I want to point out, are one of the best things to print for instant fun I've found, as some of them really go to town with giving you loads of posing options.</p>
<p>So whether it's this big guy (which you could scale up to make even larger) or any of the many other characters out there, get stuck into articulated stuff. Put the word 'articulated' into every search. Change your name to Articulated. It's your life!</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 3hrs 20mins<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 41g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/34080-ancient-guardian-articulated-from-zelda?from=search#profileId-31209">Ancient Guardian Articulated From Zelda, By Crafty Sven</a></p>
<h3 id="kirby-mouse-mode-joy-con-2-adapter">Kirby Mouse Mode Joy-Con 2 Adapter</h3>

<p>Oh Kirby, you quietly violent little blob. How I adore your ways. So much so, in fact, that I just had to choose a Kirby design for my first Mouse Mode controller adapter. I mean, just look at him!</p>
<p>I didn't, as it turns out, have any pink filament to go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_classics_kirbys_adventure">classic Kirby</a> colours here, but all that means is I got to experiment with something a little different instead. Remember with this print, if you choose to go with it, that you'll need a total of 6 hours and 20 minutes for both left and right adapters, so you might need to plan a little in advance, and this one uses lots of colours by default</p>
<p>So, if you want the classic Kirby look for a primo finish, make sure to stock up on pink, blue, black, white, and red PLA.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 3 hours 10 minutes per adapter<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 84g per adapter<br>

<h3 id="its-a-mario">It's-A-Mario!</h3>

<p>I couldn't finish up without adding this chap, could I? Oh, and in searching for this model, I discovered you can put pretty much <em>any character you can think of</em> into a search and something will turn up to print off!</p>

But there's <em>plenty</em> to come over the next 11 months, including many likely surprises for Nintendo's newest console.</p>
<p>Amidst big anniversaries for <strong>Zelda</strong> and <strong>Metroid</strong>, we already have a pretty solid suite of games coming out over the next few months for the Switch 2, from the Big N itself to third-parties like Capcom and Square Enix, who have gone all-in on the hybrid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> may have kicked things off all nice and familiar, a there are a lot of unknowns still, but with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> serving up an ace soon, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious</a> Book keeping us cosy with the kids, things are looking bright — and a little bit different. A brand new <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>, a <strong>Splatoon</strong> spin-off, a new <strong>Resident Evil</strong> day-and-date, and a long-awaited indie Zelda-like from the creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a>. All that and more should make the Switch 2 the place to play games in 2026.</p>
<p>So, there's a lot go get excited about — but what are <em>you</em> most looking forward to in 2026, dear reader? Yes, we want you to tell us about the games you're excited to play on Switch 2 for the rest of the year. Only confirmed games, of course; no speculation allowed here! (well, <em>maybe</em> a little).</p>
<p>So we've listed out a handful of big Nintendo Switch 2 titles coming out this year in the poll below, but you can also add your own suggestions using the search bar at the top. If you're looking for some suggestions, then you can use our list of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/35-upcoming-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-to-look-forward-to-in-2026">most-anticipated games for the year</a> or our library of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?sort=date&amp;status=soon&amp;system=nintendo-switch-2">all the upcoming Switch 2 games</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:181925 @ 1769885621 -->
<p>Oh, and for this poll, we're looking for Switch 2 titles only, for now at least. We're sure you're all as jazzed as us (read: this writer) to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, but that's a Switch 1 game.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, pick up to five games you're really looking forward too; get voting, now!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">ACNH</a> done got me again. It's like a transporter incident has sent me back to 2020 and I'm once again finding solace in New Horizons' custom design tool, slowly crafting Star Trek-related patterns for my own amusement, watching hours zoom by as I move a single 'pixel' one square to the left and check the result. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dartmonkey.bsky.social/post/3mdntjiik6k2h">It's a happy place.</a></p>
<p>I'm steadily turning my upstairs room into Ten Forward, although I'm painfully aware that in the game somewhere, there must be better furniture to customise and more accurate green drinks to craft, which I just haven't found yet. I've even taken to working through the dreary DLC, hoping to access more cool items. Send help.</p>

<p>I've been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a> for what feels like one hundred years, and I've JUST seen my first real indication that Uchikoshi is up to his usual nonsense. I knew he was, that crafty devil! It's so good, although I will say that A) it must have been a nightmare to review, and B) you can really tell where the frosting gets a bit thin. They've definitely shaved the plot almost to nothing in some places just to achieve the illusion of overall fullness. But, eh, I don't mind! The bits that aren't thin are pretty darn great, and there's more writing in this than I've probably read in a year.</p>
<p>Other than that, I bought a few cheapy games in the Steam Sale — <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862670/Shelldiver/">Shelldiver</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3069810/Rocket_Rats/">Rocket Rats</a>, most notably, from the same developer. They're well-polished little incremental games, and they very much give me the feeling that this developer has what amounts to a well-oiled factory machine for making incremental games in his head. I bet he can crank these out as soon as he has the inkling of a new idea. Honestly, I have such a huge respect for developers that can do that! Making games in a particular genre is like working out a muscle — it sucks and hurts and takes forever at first, but then it becomes second nature. Having the basic frameworks already built helps a lot, too!</p>
<p>Oh, god, I just read that the developer is only 25. Gonna go lie down and have an existential crisis. Gagonfe, if you're reading this, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I reckon it's pretty predictable what my games will be this week! After rolling credits on Dispatch, I know I'll be diving back in this weekend in an attempt to change up my ending and explore more of the what-ifs from my original playthrough. Knowing me, I'll likely rummage the eShop for some Telltale Games I may have missed out. Other than that, it's likely another weekend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> or finally starting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on my trusty 2DS when it arrives!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Made my way to chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, loving it! But being a confused antisocial military bad boy who somehow is the love interest of three brilliant non-existent women is not the only fun way to spend the weekend: I have picked up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/283160/House_of_the_Dying_Sun/">House of the Dying Sun</a> on PC, and it is brilliant! I always loved the <strong>Starblade</strong> / <strong>Star Fox</strong> untextured polygon aesthetic, and this game takes it to the absolute extreme with combined fleet micro management. <strong>Rumble Roses XX</strong> is proving to be a rather solid wrestling title, but a bit too much of a grind for my tastes. It will take me forever to unlock the playable roster, but it does help that I was a fan of the PS2 original. It remains better than the current Switch 2 offerings.</p>
<p>My game of the week is GRID Legends: Gold Edition. I will finally fully recover my investment on the GameCube controller for Switch 2 because no way I will ever play this without the analogue triggers. I was oblivious that the story mode for this uses old-school full-motion video and actors, which gives it a bit of nostalgic charm. I will be spending the next few weeks quite entertained in the virtual tarmac.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Last week was good timing for picking up a copy of Tomodachi Life, eh? Yes, I've been diving back into the 3DS original over the last few days, and I had forgotten how much I love this silly little game! I've scanned in all of the celebs (obviously), and have been dropping in every day to see what's happening with Reggie, Shaq, Christina Aguilera, Miyamoto and... Zendaya? I caught Aonuma rolling around his apartment floor the other day. GOTY stuff, right there.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>While a chunk of my time has been spent playing a game for review (more on that next week), Animal Crossing has taken up most of my Switch 2 gaming. We've been snowed in basically all week here in central Ohio, so not much good trying to go out and have a social life.</p>
<p>But I've mainly been catching up on an RPG white whale, which I'm shocked isn't on Switch: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/valkyrie_profile">Valkyrie Profile</a>. What a weird, cool game — triAce esoterica aside, I love the tone and combat here. It's perfect for handheld play. Thank goodness for the PlayStation Portal... I'm eyeing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, but February is looking stacked. So we'll see. Keep warm, folks!</p>

<figure data-uuid="5cc6f40c0e93e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cc6f40c0e93e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>We heard recently from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi how the follow up games to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">Switch 2 would have "exactly the same" gameplay</a> as other platforms, so when exactly can we expect the next title?</p>
<p>Speaking to Polygon recently, Hamaguchi mentioned how a status update on the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will hopefully be shared in the "very near future". So far, this version of the game has been built, and the team is now working hard to optimise and polish it. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Polygon:</strong> "Hamaguchi’s next challenge is bringing <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> to Switch 2. Though <em>Remake</em> runs great on the console, <em>Rebirth</em> is a significantly larger game, complete with small but intricately detailed open-world zones. Hamaguchi says that the engineering team is handling that tall task well so far, to the point where the port is already far along in development."</p>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> “At this point, we have gotten the game built. Our engineers are working hard to optimize and to provide the final polish on the build. I’m hoping that we’ll be able to provide more information on <em>Rebirth</em> in the very near future. Compared to the first title, the world map is a lot larger, so there is no doubt that it’s a more challenging production process. But our engineers are very passionate about the work that they’re doing, so I’m confident that we’ll be able to deliver.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebirth was released on the PlayStation 5 in 2024. At the time, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> gave the title eight out of ten stars calling it a great sequel that retained all of the Remake's most important strengths while building on an already brilliant combat system, which excelled at showcasing the iconic RPG setting.</p>
<p>This update about the Switch 2 version of Rebirth follows the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade earlier this month on Nintendo's new hybrid system. A demo is also available on the Switch 2, if you want to test it out first.</p>
