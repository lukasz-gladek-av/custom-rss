<p>Gee, ya think?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Raidou - GKC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c99fcacdec82f/raidou-gkc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japan's <a href="https://www.ndl.go.jp/en/">National Diet Library</a> (or 'NDL', for short) is one of the biggest libraries in the world and, from the year 2000, began to obtain video game CDs and cartridges for preservation purposes.</p>
<p>According to an article from <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/48598">Famitsu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-not-eligible-for-preservation-by-japans-national-diet-library-officials-say/">Automaton</a>), however, the library does not consider the Switch 2's Game-Key Cards as 'proper' physical media and therefore will not be accepting them into its 9,600-strong catalogue of game titles.</p>
<p>It shouldn't <em>really</em> come as a surprise when you consider what Game-Key Cards are. As discussed at length since the Switch 2's reveal back in April, Game-Key Cards don't hold any data beyond a license to download a game title from the eShop.</p>
<p>Not only does this present potential issues regarding storage and the near-mandatory need to purchase SD Express cards, but it's also a huge risk to preservation efforts should the eShop ever suspend its functionality.</p>
<p>So yeah, no one's going to preserve a piece of plastic that has no meaningful data on it, right? But to be super clear, the NDL stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since a key card, on its own, does not qualify as content, it falls outside of our scope for collection and preservation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems about as clear-cut as you can get. Nintendo has recently been attempting to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-sends-out-second-game-key-card-and-physical-game-survey">gauge interest in Game-Key Cards via customer surveys</a>, but at the time of writing has not made any moves to introduce more options for third-party publishers and customers alike.</p>
<p>Only a handful of third-party Switch 2 games have received a proper physical release, and according to a recent online listing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a> can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/yooka-replaylee-appears-to-be-getting-a-proper-physical-release-for-switch-2">potentially be counted amongst the elite few</a>. An official announcement seems to be just around the corner, so we'll be sure to provide an update as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>Let's test it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> would be making its way to the Switch 2 in <strong>2026</strong> came as a <em>very</em> pleasant surprise during the recent Gamescom festivities.</p>
<p>Whether you've played through the game before or simply seen the odd trailer here and there, we can probably all agree that The Great Circle looks pretty spectacular – particularly in its environmental design. So just how will a game like this run on the Switch 2?</p>
<p>Well, that's what our lovely video producer Alex is looking to find out. Using the Xbox Series S as a rough guide, he presents a hypothetical vision of what The Great Circle might look like on Nintendo's new system. He doesn't stop there though – oh no. He also checks out the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/doom_the_dark_ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As Alex notes in the video, these are not outright predictions about which games will likely come to the Switch (beyond Indy, of course), but merely hypothetical glimpses into how they <em>might</em> run with the Switch 2's specs. It's not an exact science, but it should give you a flavour, at least.</p>

<p>Though it's hardly the best quality</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Following on from our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/first-footage-of-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2-appears-online">first glimpse</a> at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> running on Switch 2 via docked mode, new footage has been posted online to showcase how the game is holding up in handheld mode.</p>
<p>General sentiments from hands-on sessions – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/first-footage-of-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2-appears-online">including our own</a> – is that Elden Ring struggles somewhat in handheld mode, with frame rate being a particularly disappointing factor. The new footage, posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtCATdtUK1c">@NGamz</a> on YouTube, does very little to either confirm or deny the initial feedback from early players, thanks in large part to the overall quality (or lack thereof – hello, 720p) of the footage itself.</p>
<p>Still, you can get a general sense of how things are holding up, and it looks... <em>okay</em>..? Again, judging frame rate from an over-the-shoulder perspective isn't ideal, so it's tough to really gauge whether there are any jitters or hiccups affecting the gameplay.</p>
<p>The footage showcases the initial area of Limgrave, with the player navigating toward Stormgate and Stormhill while slaying a bunch of enemies along the way. The video above is just one of three posted on NGamz channel, so feel free to check out the others if you want to see more; truth be told, though, it's just more of the same.</p>
<p>There's still no release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition at the time of writing, but the debut trailer reveal indicated that it would launch later this year. Unless initial feedback has spooked FromSoftware into pouring more time into the game, there's nothing to indicate that it might slip into the new year.</p>

<p>"I’m hoping it’s going to work out"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During PlayStation's State of Play presentation earlier this year, Grasshopper Manufacture announced <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a> from Suda51 and Ren Yamazaki, and it sounds like Switch 2 owners <em>may</em> be getting in on the action when the game launches in 2026.</p>
<p>According to an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6gNvAdHnfs">GameXplain</a>, Suda51 stated that the development team is currently "in the middle of doing a bunch of tests and stuff basically to see if we can put it on Switch 2". By no means is this a definitive confirmation that the game is heading to Nintendo's latest hybrid system, but it's a promising development that gives us hope.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what Suda51 said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Right at this moment, we’re in the middle of doing a bunch of tests and stuff basically to see if we can put it on Switch 2. I personally would love to get it on the Switch 2. I’m hoping it’s going to work out. It just depends on the results of this testing we’re doing. If Epic ends up working out for us – it’s made with Unreal Engine – and if it works out on Switch 2, then we’re going to do what we can to put it on Switch 2.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romeo is a Dead Man is described as an 'ultra-violent science fiction' game depicting third-person melee combat – not entirely unlike the <strong>No More Heroes</strong> series, then! It's looking like the kind of experience that could only come from the mind of Suda51, so we've got our fingers crossed that we'll be playing it on Switch 2 alongside the other target platforms.</p>

<p>The massive portable PC – dubbed the Abxylute 3D One – is actually based on a prototype co-developed by Intel and Tencent that was demoed at CES earlier this year.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gaming-pcs/theres-one-handheld-gaming-pc-that-went-under-the-radar-at-ces-2025-and-its-got-a-secret-weapon-to-beat-the-competition">"Sunday Dragon 3D One,"</a> it apparently uses eye-tracking tech to achieve its 3D effect, which, if true, sets it apart from the most famous use of glasses-free 3D in gaming so far: Nintendo's 3DS, which used parallax barrier tech to create the impression of three-dimensional depth.</p><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132yvijgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsFcYrj6oHY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Retailing for "under $1,700" according to the manufacturer, the Abxylute 3D One will be powered by an Intel Lunar Lake chip and will boast 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM and a 120Hz display.</p>
<p>According to The Verge, Abxylute claims that the device will be "specifically optimized" to play 50 of the top games on Steam in 3D.</p>
<p><a href="https://abxylute.com/products/abxylute-3d-one">When you visit the official site</a>, it's startling to see that Abxylute is using <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Fire Emblem: Awakening</a> to promote the device—two games that aren't available officially on anything but Nintendo hardware.</p>
<p>It would seem that the company is subtly promoting the Abxylute 3D One's emulation capabilities – after all, this <em>is</em> a PC.</p>

<figure><a title="X Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/568b8747adf54/x-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Most of the time, I'm pretty oblivious to game name trends. It's normally only when someone points out to me that all AAA games have names like 'Chronicle of Shadows: Rebirth', that I start to see that formula used everywhere — like when you find a trendy new pair of shoes that you swear you've never seen before, only to wear them out of the shop and see every other person styling them.</p>
<p>The way it's usually pointed out to me is when Nintendo releases a game that rehashes a title format we've seen hundreds of times before. Most recently, it was the rise of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-the-games-industry-needs-to-give-up-on-exclamation-marks">unnecessary exclamation mark</a>, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/warioware_move_it">WarioWare: Move It!</a> made me question whether I should be shouting their final word each time I said them. This year, it's X games.</p>
<p>And no, I'm not talking about the high-octane motorbike stunt riders, long may their games continue. I'm talking about 'Forgettable x Title', 'Franchise x Franchise' and, dare I say it, 'Verb x Verb'.</p>
<p>I'm looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. You have opened my eyes to the wonderful world of the meaningless 'X', and now I can't stop seeing it everywhere. It's reached the point where the humble 'X' can mean anything, nothing, or something in between, and I'm left wondering: why the heck are we sticking them in every game title like they're a piece of punctuation?</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid X Dread" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcd3c3f699dd1/metroid-x-dread.large.jpg"></a><figcaption> What could have been, eh? *shudders* — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>'But Jim, aren't there more important things to be talking about? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was finally given a release date this week, you know?'</em> Yes, I do know, but I have to get this off my chest because I fear we're reaching a point where, if Team Cherry were to release its moody Metroidvania series today, it would have been called 'Hollow X Knight' and nobody would have batted an eye. That's insane!</p>
<p>Let's look at some X games that have either landed a release, announcement, or demo in the last month alone. We've got Drag x Drive, where the 'X' is pronounced "and". <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, opts for the "<em>eks</em>" pronunciation. Indie World alumni <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit">BALL x PIT</a> has an 'X' in the middle, and the game is pronounced "Ball Pit", for crying out loud.</p>
<p>We can go further back and see it infiltrating our brains throughout recent years. We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> ("eks"), anime adaptations where the 'X' is completely bypassed when said out loud, regardless of how many there are (I'm looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/xenoblade_chronicles_x">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> ("eks" or "cross", depending on your region), and don't even get me started on the "ten"/"eks" discussions that come with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_x_x-2_hd_remaster">Final Fantasy X</a> series' blending of Roman and Arabic numerals. That's too many ways of saying "X"! <em>[Wait until you watch Hunter x Hunter and see the episode titles, Jim... Ed.~]</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>And this is where we hit the crux of my issue — my Big x Problem, if you will — I have no idea how to say game titles out loud any more. The addition of a middle X has left me fumbling through conversations as if I've never heard of a video game before. I can't deal with the embarrassment of accidentally recommending "Xenoblade Chronicles And: Definitive Edition" to a friend again. How was I supposed to know??</p>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08ab3f6566ce1/xenoblade-chronicles-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Or is the 'X' silent? "Enoblade Chronicles"? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now look, I can put my sensible hat on for a second and recognise that 'X' is a fundamentally cool and sexy letter. Marketing a game to stand out from the crowd sounds like no easy business, and if the prospect of making your title look like a cool multiplication sum is the best route to get to the top, then so be it.</p>
<p>All that I ask is that we settle on one universal sound that the 'X' represents. The <em>erg-errgh</em> 'X' sound from Family Fortunes/Feud feels a little over the top, so I'll settle on the classic "eks" for now. Either that or I'll have to keep gesturing with my forearms across my body as if I'm learning a TikTok dance every time I want to discuss the latest Sonic and Shadow joint.</p>
<p><em>Are you getting tired of Xs too, or do I need something else to worry about? Let me know in the comments.</em></p>
