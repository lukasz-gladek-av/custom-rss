<p>Picture Purrfect</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last year's delightful cat sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_kitty_big_city">Little Kitty, Big City</a>, made a surprise appearance in today's Indie World showcase to reveal the upcoming 'Picture Purrfect' update, set to land on Switch on <strong>27th August</strong>.</p>
<p>The headline addition in this one is a photo mode, hence the name, but the newbie that we're most excited to see — like, punching the air excited — is a all-new cat customisation menu, where you can tweak your cat's looks however you please.</p>
<p>Will we making our own cats and immediately filling our screenshot albums with hundreds of pictures of them? You bet we will be! It looks like there are options for markings, eye and fur colour, coat softness and more, so expect to find us closely examining our cats as if we were a fine artist preparing to paint their model.</p>

<p>The Picture Purrfect update also includes new spots in the neighbourhood to visit, a collection of new characters and, of course, even more hats for you to stick on your kitty.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks adorable, and it's completely free! For more information on the base game, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/little-kitty-big-city">our full review</a> below.</p>

<p>Baaaaaa!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've played Ultimate Chicken Horse before, then you'll know just how brilliant it is when you're able to play with a handful of friends. Well, now developer Clever Endeavour Games is back with a sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ultimate_sheep_raccoon">Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</a>.</p>
<p>Better yet, it's launching on Switch and Switch 2 this <strong>Winter</strong>!</p>
<p>Like the original, Ultimate Sheep Raccoon has you race across courses in which you place obstacles to make life much harder for your opponents. The twist, however, is that they also affect <em>you</em>. So you need to make sure you're making the course as difficult as possible while also ensuring it's still actually doable. Kinda like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker</a>!</p>
<p>This time, you'll be racing along on bikes, so you'll have the opportunity to pull off some sick tricks while avoiding buzzsaws, hammers, electric fences, and what have you. Cross-platform play is also supported, with up to 8 players able to take part in each race.</p>

<p><em>What do you make of Ultimate Sheep Raccoon? Will you be picking it up? Let us know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.
