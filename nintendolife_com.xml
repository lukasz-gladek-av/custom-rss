<figure data-uuid="17dd7efc036ac"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17dd7efc036ac/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After 105+ minutes of gameplay and breakdowns, we have finally arrived at the launch week for Masahiro Sakurai's latest joint, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>The game is mere hours away from boosting onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong> (that's tomorrow!), and that means that it's time to take a look at the reviews and give you a summary of all the different opinions out there.</p>
<p>We'll start with our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">review</a>, naturally, where the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granted Air Riders a 'Great' 8/10, praising the sheer amount of content and depth of the racing — once you get your head around what's going on. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193790 @ 1763564402 -->
<p>But are we alone in our admiration? Let's take a look around the web and find out...</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a whopping 9/10 review from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-2-best-racer-791012-20251119">GamingBible</a>, where the outlet enjoyed just about everything the game had to offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> may fall short in terms of track selection compared to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t the best racing game released this year, and one of the best first-party Nintendo games to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/">The Gamer</a> opted for a 4/5, giving particular respect to City Trial mode and the game's overall presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more so than the kart racing adjacent Air Ride, City Trial isn’t for everyone, and I can see a lot of people being put off by how relentlessly hectic and loud it can become. Still, as a connoisseur for carnage, I can’t wait to keep playing online and get wrecked by real players instead of CPU bots</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On much the same page, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/">VGC</a> also awarded Air Riders a 4/5, even if it conceded that Road Trip, not City Trial, is the standout mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this combines for a game that appears almost insultingly simple at first – virtually any action except for the special attack is performed with a single button – but hides a hidden depth in its vehicle diversity and special moves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These good times continued in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">IGN</a>'s 8/10 review, where the outlet sang the praises of the game's scope and strangeness, but felt the overall formula and controls didn't stack up to multiplayer mayhem elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest hurdle to enjoying its dizzying amount of content is how it all controls, as its frantic pace and slippery one-button control scheme is endearingly novel, but occasionally too simple for its own good</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/kirby-air-riders-review">GFinity</a> went marginally lower in its 7/10 review, appreciating the frantic excitement of it all, but feeling slightly let down by some game modes and the generally overwhelming nature of the race structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a game that fully embraces its mayhem, with it rather unapologetically overloading your senses. Sometimes that’s overwhelming, sometimes it’s confusing, but more often than not, it makes Kirby Air Riders uniquely entertaining</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, for a contrasting opinion, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro</a> wasn't as keen on Air Riders, giving it a 4/10 after struggling to get on with just about every game mode on offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then Kirby Air Riders is the game for you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Kirby Air Riders is sitting on a 78 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score based on 64 critic reviews. Hey, at least there's not long to wait until we all get to go hands-on with the full game tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>With three weeks to go until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC drops, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has unveiled its next brand new Mega Evolution, and this time it's a Mythical Pokémon getting an upgrade.</p>
<p>Zeraora was first introduced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_ultra_sun_and_ultra_moon">Pokémon Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon</a>, way back in Gen VII, and its Mega form makes a few subtle changes to its original design.</p>
<p>Its mostly-yellow fur has turned black, and there's now a lot more blue on its knees, head, and chest. its blue tuft on its head has turned to something resembling a horn, and it has a few blue spikes across its body in general. And, lastly, it now has two ponytail-like features instead of one.</p>
<p>It's definitely one of the lighter Mega Evolutions we've seen so far, especially compared to Mega Chimecho, but hey! The Thunderclap Pokémon has its fans.</p>

<p>According to the Pokédex, "The electric energy it stores in its body is equivalent to ten bolts of lightning. Protrusions on its forehead, chest, back, and the backs of its hands are where the electric energy is particularly concentrated."</p>
<p>We'll be getting one more Mega Dimension update in two more weeks (2nd December), which will likely be another Mega Evolution. Stay tuned until then!</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/outbound-brings-campervan-crafting-and-open-world-road-trips-to-switch-2-next-year</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/outbound-brings-campervan-crafting-and-open-world-road-trips-to-switch-2-next-year.1357984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>If you're into cosy games with crafting, farming, and the like, but <em>also</em> like driving around in an open world, Dutch studio Square Glade Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/outbound">Outbound</a> is coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>Previously announced for the original Switch (don't worry, it's still coming to that console if you're a Switch 1 faithful), the game was a Kickstarter success back in 2024, raising a chunky €265,679 to bring Outbound to PC and consoles in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>, and that now includes Switch 2.</p>
<p>The trailer above will give you a good idea of the gameplay blend the small team is working up, but it looks to be combining elements of open-world exploration (co-op with up to three other players if you want) with campervan decoration, crafting, farming, cooking, patting the dog - all the cosy things you might want wrapped up in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/firewatch">Firewatch</a>-esque art style.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter broke every stretch goal going, so you've also got fishing, beekeeping, other minigames, and a character editor. Here's the offical blurb and feature rundown, plus a bunch of screenshots showcasing the breadth of options available, not to mention the incredible breadth of your camper's roof that allows for all that customisation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outbound is an open-world exploration game set in a utopian near future. Start with an empty camper van and turn it into the home of your dreams - alone or together with your friends. Build and explore at your own pace. Scavenge materials, craft, and build in and on top of your vehicle with modular parts. Advance in technology and efficiently use energy to power your home. Adjust your playstyle to adapt to new landscapes and changing environmental conditions.<br>
<strong>Source Energy<br></strong>Power your electric camper van with energy from the sun, wind, or water.<br>
<strong>Build<br></strong>Build your moving base with a modular building system. Customize your vehicle with paint, decorations, and furniture to create your own perfect cozy place.<br>
<strong>Craft<br></strong>Craft workstations and tools from resources provided by Mother Nature. Research advanced technology to refine and combine them into new materials.<br>
<strong>Grow<br></strong>Create gardens to nurture delicate and delicious plants and mushrooms. Eat them raw or cook delicious meals to refill your needs.<br>
<strong>Play together<br></strong>Explore a colorful open world with a variety of biomes, resources, and secrets, together with your friends. Play Outbound alone or with up to 4 players cooperatively.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>"A utopian near future..." Yep, we'll have a drop of that, please.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter page still has an estimated delivery date of January 2026, but Q2 2026 is the official word at the moment. Given the ambition (we particularly like the sound of the four-player co-op) of this two-person team indie endeavour, we'll be impressed if it doesn't slip a little.</p>
<p><em>See? Not a single mention of BOTW visual vibes. Let us know below if you like the look of Outbound and plan on getting away from it all sometime in the first half of 2026.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/outbound-brings-campervan-crafting-and-open-world-road-trips-to-switch-2-next-year]]></content:encoded>
