<p>Forge swords and unbreakable bonds this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco and Brownies have today revealed the new roguelite action title <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/towa_and_the_guardians_of_the_sacred_tree">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It will be making its way to the Switch on <strong>19th September 2025</strong> and includes melodies from Hitsoshi Sakimoto (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy</a>). You can check out the new trailer above and here's some PR (via Bandai Namco):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this roguelite-RPG adventure set in a far-off mystic realm, ancient forces stir, and untold dangers await.</p>
<p>As Towa, lead the guardians of the sacred tree in forging strong relationships and powerful swords to fight Magatsu’s forces and determine the future of Shinju Village.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>Enter a vibrant world filled with beauty and perilous danger.</p>
<p>On your quest to restore peace, play as Towa and the Guardians as they explore far-off lands threatened by Magatsu’s evil influence. In a world where even splendor hides a lurking threat, courage is the only way forward.</p>
<p>As Hitoshi Sakimoto’s melodies guide the way, a breathtaking yet untamed landscape unfolds where the fight to save Shinju Village begins.</p>
<p>Towa, priestess of Shinju, stands united with 8 trustworthy companions to defeat Magatsu.<br>
Fight alongside a fellow guardian and wield the power of the sacred sword (Tsurugi) and staff (Kagura). Each guardian has its own abilities and sets of swords, making each combat style and guardian pair unique.</p>
<p>Together, pave your way through colorful lands, conquer dungeons, and defeat Magatsu’s minions!</p>
<p>As the guardians pursue their quests across different timelines, the village evolved over the years.</p>
<p>Develop unique bonds with its residents and learn more about their customs and stories that are woven into the inner workings of the village.</p>
<p>Each visit is a chance to train at the dojo, summon powerful Graces, and craft new swords at the smithing shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brownies, in case you didn't know, is the studio led by former founders of Brownie Brown (now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio) - who originally worked on the Mana series for Square Enix back in the day as well as titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother 3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/sword_of_mana">Sword of Mana</a>.</p>

<p>During the Summer Game Fest, Marvel fans were treated to another look at the beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, along with a look at two more playable characters.</p>
<p>She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon will join multiple other characters from the Marvel universe including famous heroes like Captain America, Wolverine and Spider-Man. Here's a bit of PR and you can see the new trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, all life hangs in the balance… To face this threat, She-Hulk forgoes litigation and takes matters into her own hands; get ready to grapple and toss enemies around with her gamma-powered might! And if you’re more into firepower, blast your way through a barrage of bugs with Rocket Raccoon and his hard-hitting futuristic arsenal! With his penchant for sporadically lobbing grenades, you’re looking at MARVEL Cosmic Invasion’s most chaotic fighter yet.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>Get ready to brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another game from Dotemu and Tribute Games (known for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a> and the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>).

</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some exciting news for Scott Pilgrim fans, with Tribute Games announcing it's teaming up with Universal and the series creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to release an "all-new, action-packed" video game entry on multiple platforms including the Switch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a></strong> is set to arrive in "early 2026" and will reimagine the fan-favourite universe with its modern approach to traditional brawlers. Here's some official PR about what exactly you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Players take on the role of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and more of the all-star crew to battle a variety of enemies in a warped version of Toronto overrun by demons, vegan henchmen and robots in an epic quest to save the city.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"With hard-hitting combat and explosive art, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX reinvents classic 2D brawling for a new era, blending high-energy action with fun character progression. Each of the seven playable characters features a full move set from the start, but players can customize their experience through upgradeable stats, and equippable special items making every fighter feel truly personal. Players will be able to dive into a brand-new storyline, co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games. They can also unleash creative combos, wield wild weapons, and brawl through co-op action—set to all-new music by Anamanaguchi —as <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX delivers a bold new chapter for longtime fans and newcomers alike."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the creator, who is deeply involved in this project, Anamanaguchi will also be returning to provide an explosive blend of 8-bit and "hyper-melodic rock". Pixel artist Paul Robertson is also helping out Tribute's in-house team on character animations and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off director and showrunner Ben David Grabinski is also on board as a creative consultant.</p>
