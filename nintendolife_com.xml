<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 1 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160906/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, Square Enix released an interesting 'stopgap' in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series called <strong>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</strong>. This free-to-play mobile game took the gacha approach to design, regularly launching new units and storylines to interact with as the years rolled by. The company wrapped up that initial version in January this year, but it decided to design a new standalone version for consoles: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
<p>Not quite a straight port of the original nor a brand new game, this fresh release converts a previously more fractured game into a cohesive traditional JRPG that features no online elements or microtransactions and feels more in line with what you’d expect from a proper numbered entry. And while it’s not the true successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">Octopath Traveler II</a>, OT0 nonetheless stands tall as another great entry in the series.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 2 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160903/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The narrative here is arguably the most interesting aspect, as it somewhat bucks the series trend of offering various disconnected narratives following each of the primary protagonists. For one thing, there’s now technically only <em>one</em> protagonist (your self-insert MC) and everyone else is merely an incidental addition to the plot. And while there’s still a nonlinear, chapter-based system that allows you to pursue the main story at your leisure, each chapter is now focused on a specific <em>antagonist</em>.</p>
<p>Even though intraparty interaction is still kept to a minimum, the storyline is nonetheless significantly more streamlined and in line with what you’d expect out of a typical JRPG. You begin as a resident of the cosy, friendly town of Wishvale, which is very quickly pillaged and razed to the ground by a nasty group of villains. After reconnecting with another survivor, you set out on a campaign of vengeance several years later, hunting key leaders of the attack, setting up the first arc of the overarching narrative.</p>
<p>What I really liked about this storytelling approach is how much more personal and interesting it made the rogues' gallery of villains. Not only do the ensuing chapters explore some of the antagonists' moral greyness, but there are some genuinely surprising and <em>dark</em> plot twists that add to the satisfaction when you finally get a chance to punch these people in the mouth.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 3 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160882/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I was always a fan of the way the first two games handled their braided narratives, but choosing to centre the narrative this time on one protagonist and various villains that have made their life hell is an interesting and ultimately worthwhile change.</p>
<p>That all said, the length of the campaign is a <em>long</em> haul. Given that this is based on a live-service gacha that grew quite a bit, there are literally <em>years</em> of storylines to experience—the developers themselves flagged that it should take you <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1963949417548923364">roughly 100 hours to clear</a>, and that’s <em>not</em> including the mountain of optional side content. I wouldn’t say that this tremendous length is necessarily a mark against Octopath Traveler 0, but just be aware that the pacing and quality can vary over that time, as any narrative of that size can get unwieldy in some places.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 4 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160875/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay otherwise follows the standard formula of previous games, wherein you explore a sizeable open world, pick up quests, fight in turn-based battles, explore dungeons, and utilise Path Actions to interact with the various NPCs you come across. Initially, you only have two party members, but as you discover and explore new towns, you eventually grow the party to just over <em>30</em>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, this is exactly how you’d expect a new Octopath entry to play, and while I would have liked to see more innovation on the gameplay side of things, it’s tough to argue that the team didn’t stick the landing with the execution of their gameplay loop.</p>
<p>Combat remains largely the same, with a key difference being that you now have <em>eight</em> active party members instead of four. Only four of them are active during a given round, but when a party member’s turn comes, they can tag out to let their backline partner take an action instead. The backline is more than just a reserve in case someone gets knocked down, too, as all characters in the rear at the end of every round also gain HP and SP.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 5 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160894/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the eight-character setup doesn’t massively change the overall flow of combat that we’re well familiar with by now, I really appreciated the additional strategic depth offered by the extra members. You effectively build BP (Boost Points) twice as fast now, which can lead to some crazy combos if you plan out your team right, and there’s a lot more to think through as you consider the various skills and abilities of each member and plan in advance how you’ll place them in the overall formation.</p>
<p>Do you put two healer characters together to maximise your healing output? Or do you pair one with a DPS character who will need to get cycled to the back to recover? The previous two games regularly asked you similar teambuilding questions, but here that more strategic approach is present to a much higher degree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, individual character progression has been kneecapped a bit, and I'm not as much a fan of how it’s been implemented. The ability to multiclass in previous games kept character-building interesting throughout the whole experience as you constantly unlocked new class types and found new ways to combine different class abilities to lead to some units that truly 'broke' the game. Here, there are no second classes; you can only progress a character along their default assigned class.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 6 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160881/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is some variation introduced by equipping Battle Skills and Support Skills gained from NPCs, granting boons like the ability to utilise wind attacks or increased healing output. However, these feel more limited than giving a character access to all the abilities that come along with a new class, and it leads to characters feeling pigeon-holed into the clear roles they’re designed to fulfil.</p>
<p>There’s something to be said about having a roster of bespoke characters who become simply <em>more</em> of what they already are at the beginning, but I’ve always viewed the Octopath Traveler games as encouraging you to find ways to make party members overpowered by building them far beyond their initial loadouts and here that definitely feels reined in.</p>
<p>Given that there’s technically only the one protagonist in this game, the Path Action system has been adapted. Now your protagonist can do <em>all</em> the actions (such as stealing, inquiring, or haggling) and the success rate is determined by how much you’ve grown their wealth, power, or fame stats by completing various quests and side quests. Which stat gets checked depends on what the character you’re talking to values most, and this also affects what path actions are available to use on them. Overall, this doesn't feel like a significant change, but I appreciated how it gave you reason to regularly return to towns, as many NPCs are clearly way above the levels you’re at when you initially meet them.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 7 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160886/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the headlining new feature is the addition of townbuilding elements while you slowly rebuild Wishvale to its former glory. Simply talking to your carpenter friend, Stia, or interacting with a workbench will turn the overgrown ruins of the once-quaint town into a grid where you can place new buildings, paths, and decorations according to your liking. Some of these buildings have a more functional passive value, too, such as how the pub allows you to bring food and prep dishes to give yourself an edge in battle for a certain number of turns.</p>
<p>As you find new towns, some NPCs will have the 'Invite' Path Action, which lets you invite them to Wishvale to contribute to the community. Every NPC has some sort of passive ability that can affect things like crop production speed or JP (Job Points) gain in battle, and housing them in your town lets you build these up over time. Plus, inviting more residents causes the overall town level to increase, unlocking new structures to build, and lets you place more homes where you’d like.</p>
<p>I appreciated how the townbuilding managed to feel both instrumental <em>and</em> optional to the game’s progression. Though there are plot reasons for why you <em>have</em> to build up the town to a certain point, it’s something that you can otherwise choose to ignore if you’d rather just stay on the road and keep pushing on to the next quest.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 8 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160898/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty to dig into here if you want to get in the weeds of building the most picturesque town possible as you regularly return to reap the rewards. And while there are concrete gameplay benefits from investing in and interacting with your town, they aren’t so enormous that you’re handicapping yourself if you choose to only return to Wishvale when necessary.</p>
<p>As far as visuals are concerned, this entry falls neatly between the fidelity of the previous two mainline games. It's clear that it was built with many reused assets from the first Octopath Traveler, but there are some details and flourishes present that will remind you more of the second game.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version runs quite well, too, and seeing the action unfold at 60fps makes everything appear that much nicer. It definitely feels like a slight step down if you’re playing this right after putting a lot of time into Octopath Traveler 2, but overall the HD-2D art style here still holds up exceptionally well and looks gorgeous in motion.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 9 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160897/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like how the visuals feel like a blend of the previous two games, the soundtrack offers a variety of tracks and remixes from its predecessors, with some new tracks thrown in there to accompany the new content. Though it’s a <em>bit</em> disappointing that we didn’t get a new full-fledged soundtrack for this release, the new music feels right in line with the previous tracks, which are just as excellent as they were when we heard them for the first time.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In many ways, Octopath Traveler 0 feels like a ‘victory lap’ for the beloved series, remixing various elements that you’re familiar with from the past games while introducing some interesting new ones to spice things up a bit. Importantly, this prequel does <em>not</em> feel like a proper Octopath Traveler 3, but that doesn’t mean that it isn't still an incredibly good time and a much better JRPG than most genre peers.</p>
<p>Even if it's a retread in some ways, though, an absolutely monstrous amount of content, interesting new gameplay elements, gorgeous visuals, and compelling storytelling all come together to make Octopath Traveler 0 a must-buy.</p></section>

Of course, many stores have been setting up the Christmas cheer for months now (this writer was seeing bedecked trees in shop windows back in October), but, as of today, the Nintendo Museum is finally following suit.</p>
<p>As shared in a post on the museum's official <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1996112175342195124">X</a> account, the lights will be on every night from 4pm JST until close (7pm), and they'll be sticking around in the grounds until the not particularly festive date of 27th April 2026.</p>
<p>While it is far from the kind of display we might expect from Disney Land — or, perhaps more accurately, Super Nintendo World — there's enough Mushroom Kingdom flair here that our nerdy Christmas spirits are sufficiently warmed.</p>
<p>Nintendo has only revealed the two photos of the display at the time of writing (one above and one below), but look! It's cute!</p>

<p>Alongside the lights, the Nintendo Museum has also plonked a Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary plaque next to the warp pipe photo op, which feels like... a very Nintendo way of marking the occasion.</p>

Following on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</a> Remake in October, we've now got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which this time puts you in the shoes of your very own custom character.</p>
<p>This game is releasing on the Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December, and ahead of our own review going live later today, the very first critic review has now been shared online. It comes from the famous Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/">Famitsu</a>. So, what did the critics at this outlet think?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gvtroz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>This new entry in the series, which sees you not only becoming the hero but also rebuilding your home, has received <strong>8/9/9/8</strong> from the four Famitsu critics, giving it a total of <strong>34/40</strong>. In the same week, this puts it two points ahead of Famitsu's score for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (sitting on 32/40) and two points <em>behind</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which leads with a score of 36/40.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> games on Switch, the first and second games both received scores of 36/40.</p>
<p>So, that's the first review for the latest Octopath Traveler game! Once again, you can find out more about it (and see our own score) when our review goes live here on Nintendo Life later today.

This week marks the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. After years of development, delays, and even a restart, Samus Aran's next 3D outing is officially here for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The critic reviews have also gone live ahead of the big release, and admittedly, the aggregate score has got a lot of people talking online. Prime 4 is currently sitting on 81/100 based on 74 critic reviews. At the time of writing, it's got the same "top critic" score on OpenCritic.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194688 @ 1764761380 -->
<p>This score technically makes Metroid Prime 4 the lowest-rated "mainline" Metroid Prime release on Metacritic. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-remastered">Switch remaster</a> of Retro Studios' first game received an aggregate score of 94/100 when it was released in 2023, and every other "major" entry in the Prime series has received a score of 90 or more.</p>
<p>As harsh as all of this may sound, it's still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">an "excellent" adventure in our books</a>, and we're not alone here – with some sites even awarding it a perfect score. Of course, these scores are focused on the Switch 2 version of the game. As you might have seen, we're currently working on getting our Switch review out the door as soon as possible. So be on the lookout for that!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194682 @ 1764761380 -->
<p>So, with the scores and lengthy wait time for this anticipated release in mind, we want to know if you will still be getting Metroid Prime 4: Beyond this week? Has anything in the lead up to this big release swayed your decision, or will you still be diving in day one? <em>Vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="53de7ecbc26e6"><a title="Starsand Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53de7ecbc26e6/starsand-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Seed Lab</em></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese dev Seed Lab has officially announced that its upcoming cosy life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starsand_island">Starsand Island</a>, is getting a Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release when it launches next year.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in the nebulous "early 2026" and coming to all the usual platforms, that list also now includes Nintendo's latest console, where the devs will be offering two modes depending on your preference: Quality Mode, "targeting 45FPS in 1080p", and Performance Mode, delivering "60FPS in 1080p" in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will also support mouse controls and GameChat during online multiplayer. You can check out the reveal trailer below if this one's passed you by thus far.</p>
<p>Now, it has to be said that we're hardly lacking for great <del>roguelike deckbuilders</del> <del>Metroidvanias</del> cosy life sims on Switch, but last year <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsandisland/starsand-island">a successful Kickstarter campaign</a> amassed over $300,000 for this one, so there's clearly an appetite for more chilled vibes and harvesting on a handheld hybrid near you.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo is bringing its island-based slow-life hit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - NS2 Edition</a> to Switch 2 in January, so Starsand might want to avoid that <em>particular</em> part of 'early 2026'. (Then again, is there anyone reading this who doesn't already own New Horizons?)</p>
<p>If you're after an overview and the vibes aren't strong enough on their own, our friends over at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/starsand-island-is-a-cosy-ps5-rpg-straight-out-of-a-studio-ghibli-daydream">recently previewed the game</a>:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193292 @ 1764761224 -->
<blockquote>
<p>"What really sets Starsand Island apart from the likes of, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, for example, is its complex build system. It functions much closer to games like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/sims_4">The Sims</a> and allows you to completely change the size and shape of buildings by adding and moving walls, doors, windows, and roofs as well as all the usual interior decorations."</p>

<p>Following an update for NieR:Automata</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="61e87ca746c94"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61e87ca746c94/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After ongoing requests from players, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nierautomata-finally-lands-switch-2-compatibility-update">got a compatibility update</a> for the Switch 2 in November. With this game now functioning as it should on Nintendo's new hardware, another Square Enix title has now received a compatibility update.</p>
<p>This time it's for the role-playing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a>, which was originally released on the Switch eShop in 2022. While it might not be the <em>best</em> remaster in Square Enix's library, there are still fans out there who have been wanting to experience this title on the Switch 2 without any problems.</p>
<p>The good news is the issues associated with this game on Nintendo's hybrid system have now apparently been resolved. Since the arrival of the Switch 2, there were some start up issues, and while these didn't appear to be a massive problem for a lot of players, there were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1l7dtsz/comment/n0i7402/?share_id=l1E6CBXyyz7XxS7LSjCtZ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">some graphical glitches reported</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing is specifically mentioned on Nintendo's compatibility search page, as of 2nd December 2025, the game is now "supported" and the "game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch" on the Switch 2. The notes attached to this mention how the "previously identified issues have been resolved with an update".</p>
<figure data-uuid="a2baf6b5624a0"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2baf6b5624a0/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a handful of compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. Apart from NieR, several other titles received compatibility updates including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>. If you haven't already played the Radical Dreamers Edition of Chrono Cross, we said it was the "best and most convenient way" to relive this classic, despite its shortcomings in the remaster department.</p>
