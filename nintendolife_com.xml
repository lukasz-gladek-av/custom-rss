<figure data-uuid="6d7c0a9b97f07"><a title="Resident Evil 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d7c0a9b97f07/resident-evil-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours regarding a potential remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a> have been simmering for a little while now, but a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">mp1st</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-for-release-after-requiem">Pure Xbox</a>) has added further fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>The remake is supposedly real and currently operating under the codename 'Chamber', which is presumably a blatant reference to protagonist Rebecca Chambers. Voice and performance capture work had reportedly begun in 2024, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy_cloud_version">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> actor Jon McLaren taking on a key role.</p>
<p>McLaren's <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren">resume</a> makes reference to a 'lead' role in 'PROJECT CHAMBER (Upcoming AAA Video Game)' with Beyond Capture Studios, which had also worked with Capcom on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. While not a definitive lead at this time, it seems possible that McLaren may be taking on the role of RE0's Billy Coen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067prgotz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Mp1st also goes on to say that "the remake is expected to expand upon the source material, although the core story will remain the same". Pretty standard for RE remakes, as far as we're concerned. They then dive briefly into a couple of potential new scenes, but we won't relay those details here. You can click through to the article if you'd like to find out more.</p>
<p>According to prominent Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362">Dusk Golem</a>, Capcom's current timeline has a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> remake launching in 2027 with Resident Evil 0 following in 2028. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the next mainline entry in the seres, will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As always, we won't treat this as gospel until Capcom itself provides official confirmation. If the timeline is even remotely accurate, it's likely we won't hear about Resident Evil 0 for a couple of years, at least.</p>

<p>It's no screenshot button, mind</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="e4eb2c32faacd"><a title="Nintendo Today" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4eb2c32faacd/nintendo-today.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> has scored a tiny update, pushing the app up to ver. 2.0.10 with the addition of a brand new share button.</p>
<p>Yep, a share button. It's hardly the most groundbreaking fresh feature, but considering how the company previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-today-update-prevents-users-from-recording-promotional-videos">removed the ability to take in-app screenshots</a> or nab screen recordings, it's a welcome one.</p>
<p>You'll find the new share button in the bottom right corner of any news item in the app. Giving it a tap will bring up your phone's usual share screen, giving you the chance to spread the news directly to another app via a link.</p>
<p>We should also point out that the person you're sharing the news with will <em>also need to have Nintendo Today! downloaded</em> to see the content, which feels... about right for this app, honestly.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the patch notes are pretty short for this one, but here they are, nonetheless:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Today Ver. 2.0.10 (20th Oct 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Share news<br></strong>You can tap the Share Button within Nintendo Today! news content to share it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo continues to roll out both major and minor announcements via the Nintendo Today! app. Most of the time, it's a piece of key art or a closer look at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> vehicle, but then sometimes we'll be surprised with the announcement of a new game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a> or an exclusive peek at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">short film</a>. Hey, maybe this share button will come in handy after all!</p>

<p>Can you see it now?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="635ed6eed54d5"><a title="Alarmo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/635ed6eed54d5/alarmo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo</strong> has received a small software update; it's first since March 2025.</p>
<p>When we say small, we really mean it. There are only two notes for this one, the latter of which provides that which we all desire in our Nintendo products: stability. Good ol' fashioned stability. Gotta love it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the alarm for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has been made easier to see, so that's nice, we guess..?</p>
<p>Let's check out the patch notes via <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/alarmo/system_update/index.html">Nintendo</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've adjusted the alarm clock in "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" to make it easier to see.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues and improved stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alarmo also recently received a more significant addition to its alarm catalogue with a bunch of music from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</a>, so if you're a fan of the big, round, pink guy, then you're in luck with this one.</p>
