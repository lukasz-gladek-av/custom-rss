<p>Update: Ubisoft CEO says it's coming to "other machines"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e18eb17f5942/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-23T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 23rd Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has apparently hinted at <strong>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong> for the Switch 2 in the company's latest quarterly earnings call.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">highlighted by IGN</a>, in a conversation with an investor regarding this title, Guillemot mentioned how there will be "some new versions" of this title "that will come on other machines".</p>
<p>Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet appeared to support this, noting how there will be another game "launched on the Switch 2" (seemingly within the current fiscal year) and this will be "beyond the announced releases" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>).</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 19th Apr, 2025 14:45 BST]</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft was already rumoured to be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-ubisoft-has-more-than-half-a-dozen-games-planned-for-switch-2">multiple titles to the Switch 2</a>, so what else might we see beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>?</p>
<p>According to a new listing on PEGI's website, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> is on the way to Nintendo's hybrid successor. You can see this on the home page of the site, but when you click through to the rating, there's no mention of a Nintendo version (<em>at least yet</em>).</p>

<p>This new entry in Ubisoft's long-running series was released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms in March 2025 and received a 'PEGI 18' rating for violence and in-game purchases. Here's the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111337">official description</a> of PEGI's rating:</p>
<h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advice for consumers</strong> This game has received a PEGI 18 which restricts availability to ADULTS ONLY and is not suitable for persons under 18 years of age. This rating has been given because it features graphic violence, violence against vulnerable and defenceless characters, and motiveless killing of innocent characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Brief outline of the game</strong> Action role-playing game, set in ancient feudal Japan, following two protagonists: Naoe, a young female shinobi, and an African samurai, Yasuke.</p>
<p><strong>Content specific issues</strong> This game contains depictions of graphic violence to human characters. It is possible to decapitate or dismember enemies, using bladed weapons. There are also examples of violence towards vulnerable and defenceless characters. Players may encounter hostage situations, where enemy groups line up bound civilians and execute them. Players are additionally able to kill multiple innocent civilians in towns and cities.</p>
<p><strong>Other issues</strong> This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items, in the form of cosmetic bundles and a premium in-game currency called Helix Credits, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are depictions of the Japanese form of ritualised suicide, seppuku, in which characters take their own lives using a blade. This occurs in the historical context of a game set in feudal Japan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest development follows Ubisoft confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration">Star Wars Outlaws will be arriving for the Switch 2</a> on 4th September 2025. A new trailer has also been revealed for this game's second "story pack" DLC.</p>

<p>It will be back soon though</p>

<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4c73a00baf37/terminator-2d-no-fate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Reef Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> has been delayed due to coordination and manufacturing issues with the physical release.</p>
<p>Now coming on <strong>31st October 2025</strong> — as opposed to its original 5th September release date — publisher Reef apologised for the delay and thanked fans "for bearing with us".</p>
<p>The delay affects both the physical and digital version of the game, and will allow "the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself".</p>
<p>"We would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> together", Reef concludes, praising fans hype and support for the pixel art arcade-style game.</p>

<p>We're more than happy to wait; this is one of our most-anticipated games of the year, so while we're champing at the bit to get our hands on it, we're sure the final game will be worth it.</p>
<p>We spent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-like-on-steroids-versus-our-previous-titles-how-terminator-2d-no-fate-changes-the-past-and-future">a good chunk of time chatting to the devs of Terminator 2D</a> about how the game is much, <em>much</em> bigger than anything Bitmap has tackled before, and just how you balance inspiration with faithfulness.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the delay in the comments</em>.</p>
