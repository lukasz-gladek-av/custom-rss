<p>50 games in one</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, Mossmouth's critically-acclaimed retro compilation, <strong>UFO 50</strong>, is out on Switch... <strong>today</strong>!</p>
<p>Announced during today's Indie World showcase, the game was developers by the creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/downwell">Downwell</a>, and <strong>Catacomb Kids</strong>. We've been itching to try this one out for a while, and now we don't have to wait any longer. <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/ufo-50">Fangamer will also be handling a physical version</a> of the game, and pre-orders are live now for $35.99 for the standard version, or $49.99 for the Deluxe (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvsu2wkil627">Wario64</a>!)</p>
<p>This isn't a <strong>WarioWare</strong>-type situation with tons of minigames — this is a full-on collection of 50 different games, all ready to play from the beginning. Essentially, the entire game is about a fictional video game company from the 80s called UFO Soft, and you can chart the development history of that company in-game.</p>
<p>There are sequels, stand-alone titles, multiple different genres, and a handful of multiplayer and co-op games too.</p>

<p>We got to try the game very briefly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-every-nintendo-switch-game-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024">at Summer Game Fest in 2024</a> and, while we only spent around 10 minutes and got to try a handful of in-game titles, we were absolutely charmed.</p>
<p>We know what we're playing tonight!</p>

<p>Underwater future slaughter</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Playism and Studio Snowblind have announced <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/glaciered">Glaciered</a></strong> for Switch 2, with a release date of winter 2025.</p>
<p>The game, which is apparently inspired by the rich ecosystems of Hokkaido, Japan, and looks a little like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, but with underwater hand-to-hand combat (good thing), sees players assume control of Twi, a dinosaur descendant who's fighting for survival in a futuristic deep sea.</p>
<p>Twi can equip lots of different gear, and upgrade through various levels to grow stronger as they fend off all manner of very bizarre-looking ocean threats. We expect there are gonna be some fairly freaky big beasties to fight down the line in this one.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for the game above, and we'll leave you with a few screens. We'll also be sure to update you with more info on this one as it arrives.</p>

<p><em>Fancy some futuristic deep ocean fighting? Fancy being a dinosaur fighting for survival in an alien world? Let us know!</em></p>

<p>What's that? You're still catching up on the news from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer"><em>last</em> Direct</a>? There's no time for that! Nintendo has another showcase up its sleeve, an Indie World to be precise, and it's right around the corner!</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo is keeping the presentations coming today, with the Indie World set to kick off in a little under half an hour at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST</strong>. There's only 15 minutes put aside for this one, but we can expect "new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch", so that's something.</p>
<p>All of this will be heading to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent), but if you'd rather watch with us Nintendo Lifers — and have a bit of a natter along the way — you can do exactly that by checking out the stream below.</p>
<p>We are just minutes away from our second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, so make sure you're sitting comfortably, and let's get ready for some indie news.</p>
