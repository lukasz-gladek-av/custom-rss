Now, without warning, the Big N has shared the front cover of the very first issue of Nintendo Power <a href="https://www.nintendo.today/en-GB/contents/21871a54-69d3-4bb0-a029-5b9402dfe18d">on the app</a>.</p>
<p>Well... this is very cool and unexpected, and comes with basically no fanfare or reason. Not that Nintendo <em>needs</em> a reason. But hey, it's cool art of Mario and Wart from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>.</p>
<p>This cover is from issue No.001, which is the July/August 1988 issue. 3.6 million copies of this particular magazine were published.</p>
<p>We're assuming this is going to be a regular thing which is a really nice idea — we'd <em>love</em> if you could read snippets from the old mags on the app, but hey, we'll take some clean art. There's always the <a href="https://archive.org/details/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20001%20%28July-August%201988%29/page/n19/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<p>Other games featured alongside the second Mario Bros. game to release in the West are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> (The Second Quest isn't Zelda II, don't worry) and <strong>Major League Baseball</strong>.</p>
<p>Nintendo Power was one of the longest-running magazines in North America and Canada, and it ran from 1988 to 2012 (under Nintendo of America's hand). A podcast headed up by former Editor-in-Chief Chris Slate ran from 2017 to 2023.</p>

<figure data-uuid="04693f01a55cc"><a title="Ash Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/04693f01a55cc/ash-pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been dealt a bit of a legal blow in Japan as the Patent Office has rejected an application relevant to the company's ongoing case against Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/palworld">Palworld</a>.</p>
<p>This patent is related to monster catching à la <strong>Pokémon</strong>, but it's not quite the same one filed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendos-patent-on-sub-characters-could-have-some-dire-ramifications">US reported on back in September 2025</a>. This one appears to be linked to the act of throwing and aiming objects to either capture a creature or initiate a battle.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">GameFray</a> reports that the patent in question (which is pending application no. 2024-031879, so not <em>specifically</em> one of the Palworld applications, but related) has been rejected as the application lacks an inventive step, determined after looking at "prior art", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ark_ultimate_survivor_edition">ARK</a> mentioned as a specific example.</p>
<p>The Notice of Reasons for Refusal, dated 22nd October 2025, states (via machine translation) that "the claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field."</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b2b3ab4a171a"><a title="Palworld Catching" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b2b3ab4a171a/palworld-catching.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>What catching Pals used to look like in Palworld — <em>Image: Pocketpair</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Evidence submitted against the application includes a video from ARK of <a href="https://youtu.be/Kj0VKPqSByA?si=p1u8CF_Dlw8jnutT&amp;t=143">a character throwing a pod-like item</a> at the ground, and at other creatures, and aiming with a blue crosshair, and a list of tools from the survival game that can be used in-game, including an arrow that can be used to stun another creature.</p>
<p>Other games mentioned for comparison are manuals, tutorials, and Wikis for <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/craftopia">Craftopia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/monster_hunter_4">Monster Hunter 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>, and the free web browser game <strong>KanColle</strong> (also known as Kantai Collection).</p>
<p>While the rejection is non-final — meaning Nintendo can resubmit their application with modifcations — it also shares a parent with <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en">JP7493117</a> (which focuses on character movement, collision, interaction, and throwing creatures at one another to initiate battle) and is the parent of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en">JP7545191</a> (which is the aiming to catch or battle in a virtual space) both of which <strong>are</strong> crucial to the main Palworld case.</p>
<p>As GameFray notes, if one member of a patent family is faced with issues, it can often highlight other problems with the rest of the group. Plus, judges often respect the decisions made by patent examiners. So we'll have to see what Nintendo's response is.</p>

<p>With the wider Palworld case, proceedings are still ongoing. Nintendo first filed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-and-pokemon-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-developer-pocketpair">a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair in September 2024</a> which "seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights."</p>
<p>Since the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/palworld-developer-pocketpair-changes-pokemon-like-summoning-mechanic">Palworld has changed its Pal catching and summoning mechanic</a>, which Pocketpair has gone on to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/pocketpair-recalls-depressing-day-nintendo-announced-its-palworld-lawsuit">speak about</a> with disappointment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/palworld-dev-announces-disappointing-game-changes-resulting-from-nintendos-lawsuit">a number of times</a>. But the developer is still considering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/forget-the-lawsuit-pocketpair-says-palworld-on-switch-2-is-100percent-worth-considering">bringing the game to Switch 2</a>.</p>
