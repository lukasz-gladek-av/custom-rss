<p>As part of the partnership, Nintendo has pledged to provide "a large quantity" of Nintendo Switch Online memberships and game download codes at no cost. How nice!</p>
<p>ISEA President Danielle Johnson said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are so excited to partner with Nintendo as we continue to grow and expand competitive gaming opportunities for students across the country. Games are a fun, communal experience. We want to make gaming accessible to as many students as possible regardless of their previous gaming experience.</p>
<p>School-based gaming programs connect students that may have not been involved in social competitive activities before, and every student deserves a place to belong at school. These programs not only raise student attendance and achievement but also help students build healthy relationships that can last a lifetime.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>aaaaaaaaa I don't know</p>

<figure><a title="Mario - 40th" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/10482f92e0b0f/mario-40th.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fans have recently been pondering over a mysterious X/Twitter account that seemingly directly references Super Mario's upcoming 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-40th-anniversary-placeholder-twitter-account/">The Gamer</a>, X account <a href="https://x.com/supermario40th">@supermario40th</a> has been causing a bit of a kerfuffle, with some suspecting that it might be legit, thus indicating that Nintendo will indeed celebrate the plumber's anniversary with a number of key announcements. At the moment, it's completely blank bar the handle, the 'aaaaaaaaa' name, and a single follow for <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo">Nintendo's Japanese account</a>.</p>
<p>So why is this even worth mentioning? Well, Nintendo's done it before, that's why. Its <a href="https://x.com/supermario35th">@supermario35th</a> account, which is still live at the time of writing, went through a very similar journey back in 2020 (it even had the same 'aaaaaaaaaaa' name, albeit with a couple more 'a's), and we covered it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/fans_have_discovered_a_private_mario_35th_anniversary_twitter_account">right here on Nintendo Life</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the potential issue we have is that the 40th anniversary account was seemingly created back in 2020. So what's going on? Well, either Nintendo itself created the account early to ensure nobody else nabbed it, or someone <em>did</em> nab it and is simply keeping it safe in the event Nintendo knocks on their door.</p>
<figure><a title="40th Account" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12cbfc94872eb/40th-account.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/supermario40th">X</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_UcjEq2Dgk">35th anniversary Direct presentation</a> for Super Mario on 3rd September 2020. It seems unlikely that the company will stick to the <em>exact</em> same schedule for the 40th, but it might well be worth keeping an eye out for a potential announcement in the coming weeks.</p>
