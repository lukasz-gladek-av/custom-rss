Snow might be settling in where you are, temperature's dropping — or perhaps you're lucky to be reading from somewherein the southern hemisphere. But there's one thing that remains the same wherever you're reading from; it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a> time once again!</p>
<p>Here we are once again, looking back at the last month of excellent releases. And it was a busy one in Switch 2 land, with two major Nintendo releases in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment and Kirby Air Riders both launching. Did we get time to play much else?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wgrkxv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> we did — and we've got a handful of the best hidden gems here from November 2025. Same rules as always apply: Our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from November 2025 from titles we've reviewed of reviews. The three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p>
<p>Easy, right?</p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Admittedly, the eShop was a bit quieter than previous months this year, so we have a limited selection. Looking at just 8/10s, so the best of the best, 5 games were in contention for the three spots. But that just means all five of these are absolutely worth your time.</p>
<p>Here's what just missed out, with the top three to follow...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/morsels">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/videoverse">8/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">3rd Place - Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Well wasn't this a nice surprise? The first of Lara's reboot series came to Switch and Switch 2 on the eShop in November, and it's a pretty impressive port, if we do say so ourselves!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is a refreshing reminder of the talent at Crystal Dynamics, a studio that has been hit by layoffs over the years. While Mouse Mode and graphical fidelity hold this back from being the definitive way to play, it's still a great way to experience Lara's origins. The gameplay is as rock-solid as ever, and the visual design and world is incredible.</p>
<p>We recommend the Switch 2 version wholeheartedly, and scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">an 8/10 in our review</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194042 @ 1765187250 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Goodness, it's like Level-5 never let off the gas. After wowing us with Fantasy Life i earlier this year (an eShop Selects winner, too!), the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> <em>finally</em> launched in November after years of delays and name changes. And, guess what? It's excellent.</p>
<p>Packed from goal-to-goal, Victory Road is a game that feels like you could play it forever. Heck, you don't even have to engage with everything, because the central soccer RPG loop is so darn good that you might not want to do anything else. It's a fabulous return for the series, and has us ever hopeful for that remake.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another 8/10 in our books</a>, meaning that Inazuma Eleven is worth the wait; the Switch 2 version is excellent, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194063 @ 1765184723 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">1st Place - Demonschool (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> might have been late to class — it was delayed multiple times prior to its release last month — but here's another game that was absolutely worth the wait. So worth it, in fact, that it <em>just</em> sneaked into the top spot to become month's eShop Selects winner.</p>
<p>Twisting tactical RPG gameplay into a new form, and blending it with daily school life and demon hunting, Demonschool is almost too cool for school. It's bloody, messy, and street smart, full of quips and humour and dashes of Italian horror-inspired imagery. We can't get enough of that unique grid-based action, either.</p>
<p>Rounding out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demonschool">our set of 8/10s</a>, Demonschool earns top marks from us, and we hope you consider enrolling.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-november-2025]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="52ff1a7a464fb"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52ff1a7a464fb/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Apart from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, one other significant Switch 2 release this week was the third-party title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. While Ubisoft's new feudal Japan outing has been mostly well-received by critics on Nintendo's new hybrid platform, it seems the experience hasn't been quite as enjoyable for some players.</p>
<p>Multiple message board posts and social media threads online are filled with player reports about the game randomly crashing. Some players have even experienced repeated crashes, forcing them to completely halt their play sessions until Ubisoft deploys a patch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ZZTIyng2dUk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZZTIyng2dUk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed746e4brzostm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The following comments in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pcp97o/assassins_creed_shadows_has_a_bad_crashing/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-supposedly-unplayable-for-some-players-after-repeated-crashes">thread on the Switch 2 subreddit</a> highlights just how much of a problem this has become for some players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DrLukeyy</strong> - "I also had 4 crashes back to back when trying to complete that add a building mission. Probably gonna wait for a patch"</p>
<p><strong>dennishylau</strong> - "I’m around Senri Hills now, and the crash is so frequent it is unplayable. Playing on dock and using internal storage."</p>
<p><strong>ApprehensiveLie8032</strong> - "My game crashed 10 times in 20 minutes, I couldn't play. And the worst part is we paid for it and there's nothing we can do; Ubisoft doesn't care."</p>
<p><strong>Safe-Reputation-2737</strong> - "My game crashes no joke every 5 minutes it’s unplayable"</p>
<p><strong>EmotionAwkward411</strong><strong>3</strong> - "Yes I confirm it is difficult to play it correctly the game keeps cutting 5 crashes in 30 minutes. I'm waiting for an update, it's impossible to play it correctly"</p>
<p><strong>stevenandthecg</strong> - "For me it is unplayable, it crashes every 2 minutes. Support is gaslighting me saying that it is an issue with my console. Never had any issue with any other game. I tried everything, I am kind of desperate..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is seemingly no clear solution or fix to stop these game crashes, but it hasn't stopped players sharing their own ideas.</p>
<p>Some suggest playing the title exclusively in docked mode, making sure the game is installed on Switch 2's internal storage, changing the system resolution, turning off HDR, disabling various other options, and even reinstalling the game...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Central</strong> - "Im playing Assassin's Creed Shadows on handheld &amp; I haven't had a crash yet &amp; the game is still on the internal hard drive of the Switch 2."</p>
<p><strong>andrsperdomo</strong> - "I installed it directly on the console and the problem does not go away."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some users here on Nintendo Life have also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">reported encountering crashes</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Critics have noted <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-impresses-in-handheld-play">issues with frame-pacing</a>, and recommend handheld mode for the best experience, but there seems to be fewer reports about game crashes during the review phase. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/">TheSixthAxis</a> was one site that directly acknowledged this "underlying issue" – referencing "a series of crashes" not long into the adventure, but "no clear trigger". <a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/73520/assassins-creed-shadows-first-impressions-nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo World Report</a> also mentioned the "occasional" software crash.</p>
<p>In our own review here on Nintendo Life, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">we admitted Assassin's Creed Shadows wasn't the perfect port</a>, but still felt it was a colossal achievement on Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>So, when might we see a patch for this problem? As highlighted in the Reddit thread above, the <a href="https://youtu.be/KYaby1Yb1Ck">YouTube channel 'What's It Like?'</a> (which also "experienced several crashes" during its review of the game) says it reached out to Ubisoft's support and there's supposedly a patch planned for mid-December, which will apparently address "some" technical issues with the Switch 2 version. And with so many player reports now, Ubisoft has hopefully got the message.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194517 @ 1765184535 -->
<p>Until we get an update from Ubisoft, tell us how your time with Assassin's Creed Shadows on the Switch 2 has been so far? Have you experienced any crashes? <em>Vote in our poll, and let us know in the comments.</em></p>
