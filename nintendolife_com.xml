<p>We were pleasantly surprised to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> make an appearance make an appearance in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Partner Direct</a>, and as we close in on its <strong>26th September</strong> release date, Bandai Namco has some fresh gameplay footage for us so we can see how it's shaping up.</p>
<p>The new gameplay trailer (above) gives us our closest look yet at the upcoming remake, with Pac-Man himself walking us through all the new additions. This includes a breakdown of his new moveset, the assist Fairy Mode and challenge Time Trial Mode, and the Pac-Village minigames.</p>
<p>The newbies are all well and good, but we're enjoying simply seeing more gameplay from the damn thing. Bandai Namco released a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pac-man-world-2-re-pac-is-a-big-glow-up-on-switch-and-switch-2">side-by-side comparison</a> of the 2002 original and the remake shortly after the game was announced, and it seems to be an almighty upgrade as far as visuals are concerned.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we thought that the last Re-Pac release was perfectly solid slice of PS1 platforming, even if it did play things a little too safe. Here's hoping that the sequel can muster up something a little more imaginative.</p>

<figure><a title="Capcom vs. SNK 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3dc2fcd885db/capcom-vs-snk-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been well over two decades since the initial launch of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a>, and although the game is now playable on Switch via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>, fans are undoubtedly desperate to see a brand-new entry.</p>
<p>Someone else who would like to see 'Capcom vs. SNK 3' is none other than Hideaki Itsuno, who served as the director for the second entry. If that's not enough, he also said that he wants to be the one who makes it.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-veteran-itsuno-says-he-wants-to-make-capcom-vs-snk-3-even-though-he-now-works-for-neither/">VGC</a>, Itsuno lamented that he is no longer involved with either Capcom or SNK, but stated that if the companies were to license the game out to him, then he'd love to make Capcom vs. SNK 3. More than anything, however, he is simply keen to make a fresh fighting game; so much so that it's "at the top of my list'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bPF0AVvJULs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed590388ztljio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPF0AVvJULs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>“I do want to make a fighting game like Capcom vs SNK, but now I’m neither Capcom nor SNK. If they license it to me, though, I want to make Capcom vs SNK 3. I want to make a fighting game, and it’s at the top of my list of games I want to make.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Itsuno is currently hard at work making a new IP within the action genre; likely similar to the likes of <strong>Devil May Cry</strong> and <strong>Bayonetta</strong>, the former of which flourished under his direction at Capcom. He left the company in 2024 to form Lightspeed Japan Studio, a subsidiary of the Tencent Games-owned Lightspeed Studios.</p>
<p>As for Capcom and SNK, the two have shared multiple collaborations and crossovers over the years, perhaps most notably in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which saw the release of Terry and Mai as playable characters, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fatal_fury_city_of_the_wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, which recently welcomed Ken into its roster.</p>
