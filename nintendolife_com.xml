<p>Hey, listen!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Zelda: Ocarina of Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22378a2e0cf02/zelda-ocarina-of-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lego released its first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>-themed Lego set last year after ongoing rumours, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/lego-zelda-deku-tree-set-rumours-resurface-online">turned out to be accurate</a>. Now, in an update, there's a new rumour doing the rounds about the next set in this particular series.</p>
<p>Instead of a hybrid set bringing together two different games, this next one is rumoured to be based solely on Link's N64 outing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. According to a story from <a href="https://youtu.be/b04dj4jMGgI?t=285">BrickTap</a> (<a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">via Brick Fanatics</a>), it will be a Ganondorf Diorama.</p>
<p>The product name, "which may not be final" as <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">highlighted by the same source</a>, is supposedly '77093 Ocarina of Time Ganondorf Diorama'. It will apparently contain 1003 pieces and is expected to be much cheaper than the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set as a result (which contains 2500 pieces). As for the launch, it's believed to be arriving in March of next year.</p>
<p>Again, this is strictly a rumour for now, but there would definitely be plenty of potential for a Ganondorf Diorama or at least something similar. He obviously has a huge role and plenty of scenes in Ocarina of Time, so it will be interesting to see what comes of this, if it is the real deal. The Zelda series' 40th anniversary is also taking place next year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-everything-announced-for-super-marios-40th-anniversary">and much like Mario</a>, big celebrations are expected.</p>
<p>If you haven't taken a look at the Great Deku Tree set just yet, be sure to read (or watch) our review. The 2-in-1 build allows you to create the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. At the time of its release, we called it a striking addition to Lego's growing line of Nintendo sets, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Adventure 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3ab8146087c65/sonic-adventure-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>You might recall how there's been some drama over the popular <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2</a> track '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1BRZg0GG0A">Live and Learn</a>'. Crush 40 musician and singer Johnny Gioeli filed a lawsuit against Sega last December, claiming he had not been correctly compensated over the past 23 years.</p>
<p>In an update, <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/uploads/pages_media/2025-usgovcourts-gioeli-sega-judgment.pdf?_cb=1758535347">new court documents</a> have confirmed the case has been dismissed. <a href="https://x.com/Crush40Johnny/status/1970123862810525733">Gioeli has also issued a statement</a> now that "the news is out". He says the reason for dismissal is based "on time" rather than ownership, further claiming the song is his even though the rights to it remain in "limbo".</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0qgyhkv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Johnny Gioeli:</strong> "Everyone- the news is out that the case agasinst SEGA was dismissed. I want you to understand that the reason for the dismissal was based on time, not on ownership. The song remains in "limbo".</p>
<p>Just 2 weeks ago, I was contacted by Epic Games to potentially use Live &amp; Learn... and the amazing part is SEGA had them call ME for the rights to use the song. So- there you have it. The most epic song remains in the "abyss of ownership".</p>
<p>The song is mine. I wrote it with June, I sing it, I created the melody, I recorded my vocals in my studio, and they do not own it.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for your endless support and love. Life isn't always fair... but we all move forward in love and music. - Johnny</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the original court documents, Gioeli received no compensation, and judgement is in favour of Sega, with the action dismissed in its entirety. If we hear any significant updates or developments, we'll let you know.

<p>The Nintendo version launched in July of this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c45ef279a6a5/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo, 2K</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just months after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> on the Switch 2, 2K Games has now revealed the title's server shutdown date.</p>
<p>As of <strong>14th March 2027</strong>, all online features and services will end for the title. Offline services like Play Now, Showcase MyRISE, MyGM and Universe will continue to be playable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scheduled Online Services Retirement Date</strong></p>
<p><strong>WWE 2K25:</strong> "Online features and services are scheduled to be available until 14th March 2027."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the title a two-year lifespan since its original release for <em>other</em> platforms on 14th March 2025. Based on this, the time frame is even less for Nintendo players as the Switch 2 version was only released on 23rd July 2025. The physical version of this particular entry is also a "code-in-box".</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 is one of many games to join 2K's scheduled online retirement. Ahead of this, the company will end online services for <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wwe_2k24">WWE 2K24</a></strong> on 5th January 2026.</p>
<p>Although the winding down of online services in games doesn't appear to be stopping any time soon, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">'Stop Killing Games' consumer movement</a> has been attempting to challenge the legality of publishers "destroying" certain video games sold to customers by revoking access following the cessation of online support.</p>
<p>Recently, a video game lobbying group in Europe (made up of major players in the game industry including Nintendo, Microsoft and more) put forth an argument that maintaining online support indefinitely could have a "chilling effect on game design" and act as a disincentive to make such games available in particular regions.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and WWE 2K25 in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

Capcom is currently offering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which was a launch title for Nintendo's new system in June) for half price in the US.</p>
<p>This takes this title, which has now surpassed five million combined sales globally, from $39.99 down to just $19.99.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is the base game, so the DLC and Season Pass content is locked off, but there's still a lot on offer. This includes three major game modes and a roster of 18 fighters, including new faces and returning fan favourites. It also features some special gyro game modes exclusive to the Switch 2 version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7mhlspg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
