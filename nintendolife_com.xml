<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b44fcfe89baf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price is continuing to skyrocket following the early success of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a>, the company's share price currently sits at a staggering <strong>¥14,355</strong>. For context, this is now double Nintendo's value at the height of the Wii era.</p>
<p>On 31st October 2007, the markets closed with Nintendo sitting at <strong>¥7,170</strong>. Naturally, things took a turn for the worse following this, thanks in part to the 2008 financial crisis and the unfortunate failure of the Wii U in 2012.</p>
<p>But now, with Nintendo recently confirming that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">sold more than 6 million Switch 2 units</a> since its launch on 5th June 2025, things are looking up (and up, and up). In addition, it's made no chances to its forecast for the year ahead, meaning the company expects to sell at least 15 million Switch 2 units before the end of the financial year. Wowie zowie!</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Share Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b821061d0d27/nintendo-share-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reception around the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World Direct</a> has been mixed, to say the least, but it's clear that Nintendo has a pretty solid line-up of Switch 2 games in the months ahead. You've got first-party titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, along with big third-party offerings like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a>.</p>
<p>Uncertainty lingers around the price of the Switch 2 – particularly following recent price increases of Switch 1 hardware in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-how-much-nintendo-switch-online-is-going-up-in-canada">Canada</a> – and there remains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">significant discontent around Game-Key Cards</a> for the Switch 2, but right now, it appears that Nintendo is well and truly on top of the world.</p>
<p>Finally, for comparison, here's how a few other key companies are doing at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capcom - ¥3,959</li>
<li>Square Enix - ¥11,055</li>
<li>Sony - ¥3,995</li>
<li>Konami - ¥24,560</li>
<li>Bandai Namco - ¥5,317</li>
<li>Sega - ¥3,306</li>
</ul>

<figure><a title="UFO 50" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2af597ce3524e/ufo-50.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mossmouth</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahoy, there! The weekend is here, so it's time to kick back with some games. But first, let's quickly recap the week, hm?</p>
<p>We had a pretty banging <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World showcase</a>, so that was pretty cool, with lots of really neat announcements and shadow drops. Elsewhere, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">a new range of Mario products</a> for younglings, including a pretty expensive wooden block set with amiibo functionality.</p>
<p>Nintendo ruffled a few feathers again with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-wont-let-charity-speedrunning-event-use-its-games-without-permission-because-of-course">its stance on a charity event using its games</a>, while our Jim talked at length about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-really-dont-need-a-donkey-kong-timeline">Donkey Kong timeline</a> and how we kinda don't really need one.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm pretty spoiled for choice this weekend folks, I won't lie. I'm planning on playing a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> after my recent review, but I also want to dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> and see what all the fuss is about. I also downloaded the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> demo, so I'd like to give that a shot, but then I also need to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a> for review.</p>
<p>Man... Too much!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>UFO 50 is staring me right in the face as I mop up 100% completion on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and look ahead to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>. What timing for a game I’ve been really excited to play since SGF last year?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’ll be trying out the Mina the Hollower demo because apparently we’re just going through a bunch of Zelda-esque game demos right now. A short and sweet one from me, folks – have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>After waiting all this time to dive into Mina the Hollower, I still haven’t found the time to dive into the demo yet — I know! Madness! I’ll be excited to take that for a spins this weekend, before probably booting up one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games on NSO to scratch more of the retro Zelda itch.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it’s the Global Jam session for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> and I’m actually… kind of excited to check it out? I wasn’t blown away at the Switch 2 hands-on event earlier in the year, but perhaps playing it with some worldwide competition will help change my mind.</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I find myself still knee-deep in banana shards and loving every second of it. I'm down to sublayer 1200-summin', and I'd be a damn-sight further if I weren't constantly distracted by some glinting goodie in the distance or a buried banana shadow revealed by a sonar slap.</p>
<p>However, UFO 50 arrived on Thursday to challenge DK to supremacy on my Switch 2, and I'm absolutely itching to get stuck into that, too. Not the best weekend to have relatives arriving for a holiday, to be honest. Bloody family, with their love and support and effort to come visit me in foreign climes. Don't they know I've got bananas to smash!?</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm packing my bags for the annual offline vacations. On those very same bags I take 250 days straight of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer</a>. All good things must come to an end, so that’s my season finale on that “game”. It is still very much the “Summer of the Ninja” around here, so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will carry me on this and the next weekend, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> and the last third of World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (hey, Sagat is here! But it takes real money to get him… curse these new ways of the industry).</p>
<p>Did a bit of binge-spending yesterday on the eShop so also on my bag goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">House of the Dead 2 Remake</a>, the wonderful UFO 50, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> (go watch the movie, seriously!) and M2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gradius_origins">Gradius Origins</a>, which comes with the brand new, 1998 theoretical sequel Salamander III. Since I also failed miserably not to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on STEAM last week it’s going to be one great Summer for shmup action!</p>
<p>This will be my first time taking the Switch 2 on the road and looking back at the last eight Summers where the original Switch model was a constant slice of my cherish memories, can’t help but feel really excited looking at what’s to come, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> being a particularly strong bleep on my radar.</p>

<p>Including fighters from the Year 2 and 3 DLC</p>

<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00d20f07d1705/street-fighter-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: via Amazon / Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Capcom released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 in June, it also launched three new amiibo as well as an amiibo card starter set containing 22 cards.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the second series of cards has appeared online. According to multiple listings, this set will feature new cards for the existing roster of fighters and cards for the "Year 2 and Year 3" DLC characters. Some of the artwork on Amazon shows close-ups of the cards for Elena, A.K.I. and M. Bison.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the 38 new cards, along with a box including 15 boosters. Capcom hasn't officially revealed when the new set of cards will be made available just yet, but when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7xtgkmr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In-game, these cards allow you to save your character's costumes, colours and control type, along with button settings. You can also unlock items like wallpapers and photo frames.</p>
<p>This news for Street Fighter 6 follows on from the release of the DLC fighter Sagat earlier this week. Along with this, Capcom has also updated the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> with four characters for <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/capcom-fighting-collection-2-free-title-update-now-live-on-switch-and-switch-2">Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Capcom <a href="https://youtu.be/vVHYuILrqFM">recently released a "demonstration video"</a> about how Street Fighter 6's amiibo work on Switch 2.</p>

<figure><a title="Tron: Catalyst" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e58bd7450cda2/tron-catalyst.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Good Shepherd</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bithell Games, the developer behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/john_wick_hex">John Wick Hex</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_identity">TRON: Identity</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a>, is sadly making "eleven jobs" at the studio redundant.</p>
<p>Studio founder Mike Bithell shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">a message on Bluesky earlier today</a> stating that his studio — which he founded in 2013 following the release and critical success behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thomas_was_alone">Thomas Was Alone</a> — has "been unable to secure a new large scale project" and is "reducing in size" as a result.</p>
<p>With eleven jobs being made redundant, Bithell says that "This constitutes the majority of our full-time staff." But the studio was able to make this difficult process as easy as possible.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mkxrhz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025. We've fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance packages."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Around the time of the studio's most recent release, Tron: Catalyst, Bithell shared an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lrplvwf3g22z">extensive list of people who worked on the game</a>, all of whom are worth celebrating. And Bithell continues his statement with even more praise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's important to state that this was an incredible team of exceptionally talented people. If you're a developer reading this, and you're hiring; anyone among those affected would be a great addition to your studio, please reach out if we can help to put you in touch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bithell Games' existing self-published games will remain available and the existing members of the team will continue to support them, with the founder hoping that "your interest in our work follows individual team members" affected by the news.</p>
<p>"Bithell Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less."</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all of those made redundant at the studio.</p></section>
