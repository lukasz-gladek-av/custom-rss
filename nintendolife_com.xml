<p>"Pokopia was a huge surprise"</p>

<figure data-uuid="5880f3ba02a93"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5880f3ba02a93/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>This March, Pokémon is expanding beyond its usual battle roots with a brand-new game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> that seems to include a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>If the information and trailers shared about the game haven't already sold you, maybe the previews will. Here's what our staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say about this upcoming Pokémon title, and below this, you can see what other sites said, based on their own hands on impressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations, Pokopia was a huge surprise... It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fujnryh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57586-hands-on-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-the-series-coziest-game-yet">GoNintendo</a>: "It’s hard to predict whether or not a Pokémon spinoff will turn into something beloved or have a real lasting impact, but I think Pokopia has what it takes to get there. It provides an opportunity for fans to interact with some of their favorite creatures in a very different, more relaxed way, without a battle in sight. Die-hard Pokémon fans and anyone who’s become enamored with cozy life sims over the last few years should keep Pokémon Pokopia"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/90-minutes-with-pokemon-pokopia-convinced-me-this-could-be-the-biggest-cozy-game-since-animal-crossing-and-im-already-eager-to-spend-hundreds-of-hours-in-it/">GamesRadar+</a>: "90 minutes. That's all it took to convince me that Pokemon Pokopia is going to take over my life. This cozy, Animal Crossing-flavored take on my favorite creature-collecting series is packing a real punch – moreish exploration, building, and collection mechanics combined with delightful personality and a generous dose of feel-good: even from a short preview session, this is a game I can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into."</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a>: "Put simply, this is <em>Pokémon</em> meets <em>Minecraft</em>, with a delightfully goofy premise and the potential for lots of town-building fun to be had either by yourself or with a group of friends via online play."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-preview-hands-on-best-entry-years-731895-20260211">Gamingbible</a>: "I barely feel as if I’ve scratched the surface of discovering what <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> has to offer and yet, I’m entirely sold on its vision. This isn’t simply a formulaic cosy game with a Pokémon overlay. It’s a really wonderfully considered creation that’s as accessible to diehard fans as it is to complete and utter novices. I haven’t stopped thinking about <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> ever since I heard the dreaded words “time’s up”, so I certainly know what I’ll be picking up come 5 March."</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/11/gotta-house-em-all">Game Informer</a>: "Pokémon spin-offs are very hit or miss for me, but after playing a bit of Pokopia, my gut says this one will be a hit. It balances the aesthetic and accessibility of Pokémon with open-ended, relaxed mechanics found in cozy simulation games, and it does so without feeling boring or overly simple. I'm looking forward to playing the final product when it launches in just a few weeks."</p>

<p>In case you missed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">the announcement last month</a>, Nintendo is releasing its first new Joy-Con 2 colours for the Switch 2 this week.</p>
<p>Light Purple and Light Green are now available as a set, and are priced at <strong>$99.99 / £74.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), with purchases now available on Nintendo's website and in-store.</p>
<p>Apart from the subtle colour change, these controllers are exactly the same as the ones that come with the Switch 2. In other words, they use the same magnetic connectors, support HD rumble, and each one can be used as a mouse in compatible games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The updated Joy-Con 2 controllers have easy-to-use motion controls and HD rumble 2, along with the new C Button for easy GameChat* access and all-new mouse controls in compatible games.</p>
<p>"This set includes both a left and right Joy-Con 2 controller, along with a pair of Joy-Con 2 straps, perfect for local multiplayer with a friend in compatible games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a look at these controllers attached to the main unit. This new set launches alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> this week.</p>

<p>Version 1.0.1 is required to play online</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you plan on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> on the Switch 2 this week, be ready for a day one update bumping the new software up to Version 1.0.1.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68671">official patch notes</a> on Nintendo's support page, the development team has apparently addressed "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience". However, it doesn't specify what exactly has been updated. If we find out what has changed, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Perhaps, more importantly, this launch update is required to access the game's Switch Online features. Once you've updated to this version, you'll no longer be able to play locally or via LAN with older versions of the game - so make sure you are running the same update when playing together with family and friends.</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932pujsyt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As our reviewer PJ O'Reilly mentioned in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever review</a>, the main adventure mode is a bit of a letdown, and solo players don't have a lot of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come. So you'll want to get online play up and running!</p>

<p>As part of this launch, Nintendo has also released a new set of Mario Tennis Fever Switch Online icons today. New waves will be available every week until <strong>11th March 2026</strong>. These icons will set you back <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong> each, and as usual, the borders and backgrounds go for <strong>5 Platinum Points</strong> each.</p>
