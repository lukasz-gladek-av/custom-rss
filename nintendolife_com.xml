<p>We still don't know exactly what 2026 will hold for Splatoon 3. 2024's 'Grand Festival' brought regular updates and Splatfests to an end, though the game stayed alive and kicking throughout 2025 with continuing seasonal events and the surprise release of a free Switch 2 update.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the game received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">PEGI rating for a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, though Nintendo has yet to confirm anything just yet.</p>

<p>Final stream was a speedrun of Pokémon Emerald</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The <strong>Awesome Games Done Quick 2026</strong> event has now closed with a total of <strong>$2.443.554</strong> raised for the <a href="https://preventcancer.org/">Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The week-long fundraiser ended with a speedrun for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Pokémon Emerald</a> by streamer adef, who managed to beat it in 3 hours and 13 minutes. Other highlights from the event include a 70-Star, 70-Player relay for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> and an any% speedrun for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> from streamer Ceen, who stormed through the game to beat the final boss in 54 minutes and 55 seconds.</p>
<p>The next major event, Summer Games Done Quick 2026, will take place later this year from <strong>5th - 11th July</strong>, with donations going to <a href="https://www.msf.org/">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> (Doctors Without Borders).</p>
<p>The charity events have not been without controversy, with the 2022 Summer Games Done Quick fundraiser seeing the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/sgdq-fake">complete ban of speedrunner Mekarazium</a> for faking a run of the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/metal_gear_rising_revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a> DLC. The player had shown a segmented, pre-recorded video of the run rather than playing it live, later admitting to this and receiving a ban from future GDQ events.</p>

<p>While CEO Ryan Rohen eyes up $35 billion pay packet</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7b93f790bb70d"><a title="GameStop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b93f790bb70d/gamestop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The coming of the new year is a good time to take stock and look at the 12 months ahead with a sense of optimism. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/">Polygon</a>, however, GameStop has instead decided to kick off 2026 by shutting hundreds of its stores in the US.</p>
<p>News of such closures apparently came as quite the shock to employees, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/gamestop_really_put_a_trade_coupon_on_my_local/">signs being hastily pasted to storefronts confirming the news</a>. To add insult to injury, the same signs offered up an extra 20% on trade-ins if customers head to alternative GameStop locations.</p>
<p>Many customers have reportedly noted that some store closures have left them with few alternatives, with one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q4vm6i/comment/ny0n4bi/">Reddit commenter</a> stating that their nearest store is now "1.5 hours away".</p>

<p>It's estimated that <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/2025/12/january-2026-reported-closings.html">up to 296 stores closed in the first week of 2026</a>, with even well-performing locations being given the chop. It seems likely that such drastic action is somewhat linked to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm">recent announcement</a> that CEO Ryan Cohen could bag a pay packet worth an astonishing $35 billion, but only if the retailer is able to reach a market cap of $100 billion.</p>
<p>This is roughly ten times its current value at $9.3 billion, so it's a pretty wild target. The announcement clarifies that Cohen "receives no guaranteed pay—no salary, no cash bonuses, and no stock that vests simply over time", with the compensation being entirely "at-risk".</p>
<p>It's not a case of "all or nothing", mind you, with Cohen's compensation available in nine tranches (or 'portions'). The first is available if GameStop achieves a market cap of $20 million, with each subsequent tranche requiring an addition $10 billion in value all the way up to £100 billion. So even if GameStop only manages to reach £20 million, Cohen will still earn billions in shares.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores">RNZ</a>, GameStop is also considering ending its EB Games business in New Zealand, which would mean the closure of 38 stores in the region. According to the notice sent to employees, the proposal is "not final, and no decision will be made until we have completed a full consultation process in good faith with affected team members."</p>

<p>At least, that's what we found this weekend, when the latest 'Frosty Fest' celebration arrived in the Splatlands and crowned yet another Splatfest champ.</p>
<p>It was <strong>Team Solo</strong> that walked away with the win in this year's battle of '<strong>Who do you spend the holidays with?</strong>', snatching up <strong>460p</strong> after a tough weekend of battling. Team Friends narrowly missed out on the gold with their respectable 410p and the less said about Team Family, the better (they finished on 0p, <em>oop</em>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12erohzis&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Well, that's Frosty Fest sorted for another year — remember to collect your Super Sea Snails from the plaza if you took part. As far as we know, these seasonal events should continue throughout the rest of 2026 (see you all for 'Spring Fest' in a couple of months, then), that is, unless the as-yet-undated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a> brings things to a halt whenever it launches on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a surprise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">Switch 2 listing for Splatoon 3</a> cropped up on the European age rating board PEGI, sparking rumours that the 2022 shooter may soon return in a swanky new package. Nintendo's yet to confirm any of this, of course, but we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for more updates down the line.</p>
