<p>The update brings a whole bunch of quality-of-life improvements to game alongside some standard bug fixes. The remaster launched on <strong>19th June 2025</strong>, shortly after the Switch 2 itself landed, and brought extensive improvements to the PS2 original.</p>
<p>We gave the game a score of 8/10 and said that it "is a wonderful retread of a forgotten classic, smartly polishing up its best parts and modifying its worst parts to make for an overall more enjoyable experience".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wngzhq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-metroid-prime-4-reminds-me-of-gears-5-and-its-making-me-nervous.1299423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>I’m starting to feel nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Let me explain. During the most recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the long-gestating game finally received a release date for <strong>4th December 2025</strong> on Switch and Switch 2. That’s not all, though; the accompanying trailer also revealed that Samus would now be rocking her very own <strong>Akira</strong>-inspired motorbike called Vi-O-La.</p>
<p>After a handful of environmental shots to set the mood, the trailer showcased a series of close-ups of Samus revving up Vi-O-La before storming off into a vast desert landscape at speeds that would make Captain Falcon break out his best <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/miyagi-PudZiAbQDUEik">Mr. Miyagi nod of approval</a>.</p>

<p>I couldn’t quite gather my thoughts when I watched the trailer for the first time, but after a second viewing, a comparison entered my mind that I’ve not been able to shake ever since: Metroid Prime 4 reminds me of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/gears_5">Gears 5</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I know the two games probably aren’t even remotely comparable on the surface, but Gears 5 actually delivered fans their own sense of whiplash when it delivered its take on the open world back in 2019 (which came, curiously, mere months after development on Metroid Prime 4 was completely restarted under Retro Studios).</p>
<p>Following a fairly linear prologue sequence, Gears 5 revamps the series' structure by offering up a vast open space that can be traversed via a wind-powered vehicle called 'The Skiff'. Essentially, key locations are be scattered throughout the world and you have to hop in your Skiff to make your way from one to the other.</p>

<p>So it wasn't an open world in the sense that, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> is. Yes, you can "go anywhere", as the saying goes, but it was more or less a means of reaching your intended destination, with little in between. These destinations then provide the 'traditional' Gears of War experience that fans are accustomed to. Nevertheless, it gave the game a real sense of scale, far more so than any of the previous entries, and I appreciated it for that.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Gears 5 is <em>not</em> Metroid Prime 4. The latter is the next mainline entry in a series that, in both 2D and 3D, has famously focused on dense, interconnected environments that can be wholly explored on foot (with the odd elevator here and there, of course) – this, along with a similar approach in <strong>Castlevania</strong>, led to the coining of the term 'Metroidvania'. The minor exception here is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3</a> which featured multiple planets, but the sequences in which Samus would travel from one to the other was essentially just an elaborate elevator cutscene.</p>
<p>So while open spaces worked in Gears 5, I'm not sure yet if the same can be said for Metroid Prime 4. It’s still early days of course (yes, even after eight years of waiting), but the short gameplay segment in the recent trailer did enough to convince me that Retro's latest effort is taking more than a few cues from Gears 5. You can see key locations off in the distance, but bar a few pesky enemies, the more immediate surroundings look pretty barren.</p>
<figure><a title="Prime 4 / Gears 5 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e5808101e1fb/prime-4-gears-5-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I really want Metroid Prime 4 to try something new; it’s been eighteen years since the last mainline Prime game, so I’m not going to be satisfied with “more of the same” in this instance. But I also don’t want Metroid to lose what makes it, well… <em>Metroid</em>. What a conundrum. We’ve only got about two-and-a-half months to go until its release, so hopefully Nintendo will share a bit more information in that time and assuage my fears.</p>
<p>At the very least, we know the company is able to pull off some pretty amazing open worlds with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>; my guess is they won't let Retro Studios deliver anything less than spectacular. Here's hoping, anyway.</p>

<figure><a title="MvC: Fighting Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/943fe902c6a0b/mvc-fighting-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> has sold a total of 1 million copies since its launch in September 2024 (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collections-impressive-sales-show-fans-are-hungry-for-more">Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>Announced via social media, the translated post reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection global sales surpass 1 million copies!</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you, we have achieved global sales of 1 million copies!</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued support for this title!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's an impressive result for Capcom, but it seems almost guaranteed that we won't get a brand new entry in the series – at least not any time soon.</p>
<p>The reason for this, of course, is that Marvel is now collaborating with Sony on the new PS5 / PC title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, with acclaimed developer Arc System Works (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>) at the helm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6ePAJ6dxYWY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea9hzlomt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePAJ6dxYWY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's not out of the question that we might see a new MvC in the future, but with Marvel Tōkon launching in 2026, we reckon Capcom might be more inclined to create a new entry in the Capcom vs. SNK series.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a> director Hideaki Itsuno recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/capcom-vs-snk-2-director-really-wants-to-make-a-third-entry">stated his desire to make a third game</a>, and said he would do so if Capcom and SNK licensed it to his new studio, Lightspeed Japan Studio.</p>
