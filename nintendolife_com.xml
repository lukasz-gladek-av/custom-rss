<p>According to the eShop</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Did you know that Yuzo Koshiro, legendary video game composer, has made a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis shmup? It was released on Steam back in July, with our friends over at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/steamdeck/earthion">Time Extension giving it a glowing review</a>. It was due to launch on consoles, including Switch, at the same time, but <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/the-console-versions-of-yuzo-koshiros-earthion-have-been-delayed">was pushed back to "mid-September"</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> will be landing that mid-September date, as the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/earthion-switch/">eShop page</a> says the game is coming out on 18th September 2025. That's just over two weeks away!</p>
<p>Published by Limited Run Games and developed by Koshiro's company Ancient, Earthion is a gorgeous-looking shoot 'em up developed <em>for</em> the classic Sega console. That version is coming in 2026, but for anyone wanting it on modern consoles, you won't have long to wait.</p>
<p>Like many of the best shmups, the Earthion keeps things simple, giving your ship a main weapon and two sub-weapons and eight diverse stages to blast your way through.</p>

<p>We'll point you towards Time Extension's review for the low-down, but if you're not sold on Makoto "Karu_gamo" Wada (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gotta_protectors_cart_of_darkness">Gotta Protectors: Cart Of Darkness</a>) and Koshiro's yet, here's a little snippet from that review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Earthion is everything I'd hoped it would be when Yuzo Koshiro first announced it; a challenging shmup which pushes Sega's 16-bit hardware to its limits in terms of visuals and audio whilst combining a high level of polish with tight gameplay and plenty of longevity."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well now, that sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Let's hope that the 18th September date sticks — we've had no word from the publisher or developer on it yet, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Earthion in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>It's getting Hutt in here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are just one day away from the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> on Switch 2, and while we at Nintendo Life are still hard at work in the Jedi Temple, getting our review in order, we do have some gameplay footage for you to feast your eyes on in the meantime.</p>
<p>In the above video, you'll find 16 minutes of Outlaws on Switch 2. We've got gameplay from a whole bunch of scenarios, including internal environments, stealth sections, open-world exploring and outer space dogfights, so you can get an idea of what Nintendo's latest hybrid has in store.</p>
<p>The good news is, it looks really rather solid. We felt a disturbance in the Force when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-force-isnt-strong-with-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-initial-impressions-suggest">initial impressions</a> on the game's performance began to appear out of PAX West, but from what we've seen with our own eyes far, it plays far better than expected — heck, it looks like a totally different game to the low-frame footage Ubisoft shared in official trailers. Sure, it's a step down from the PS5 version as far as visuals are concerned, but it's nothing like as choppy as we were braced for.</p>
<p>Everything that you'll see above is from docked play, but video producer extraordinaire Alex Olney has also had a chance to play about in handheld mode, and it sounds equally promising. "It's soft, but it's perfectly playable," he said. "Frame rate is stable enough, leagues ahead of what the official trailer showed, which is a blessed relief".</p>
<p>As we mentioned, you'll have to wait a little while longer before you can read our full review for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2, but we'll endeavour to have it with you as soon as possible.</p>

But its announcement also may have confirmed a major leak for the service — a line-up of games coming to the N64 app (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-latest-switch-online-news-couldve-just-confirmed-a-major-leak/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">Back in July 2025</a>, an eagle-eyed fan and <a href="https://x.com/ImakuniVT/status/1941912231303585925">VTuber on X</a> (alongside friends on Discord) spotted what looked to be blurred box art for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>, and the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros</a> alongside a certain 'Mature' N64 game — Forsaken — in a trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/youtube.com/watch?v=wDNg1pwrTVg&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">posted back in May</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Forsaken's arrival on the Mature app seems to have all-but-confirmed that the other titles spotted above are also coming. You can see the blurred boxes <a href="https://youtu.be/wDNg1pwrTVg?si=A4xAoMBhc0OHgzGx&amp;t=41">at around 0:41</a>.</p>

<p>If true, that's a pretty solid list of games — and given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s release in July, many have been clamouring for DK's other 3D platformer to make its way to the service.</p>
<p>Crucially, of course, nothing is confirmed until Nintendo itself makes the announcement, and we have no idea when we'll actually get these games, <em>if</em> the blurred-out image is to be believed. We'll just have to wait and see...</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out Forsaken from tomorrow if you have the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p><em>Do you hope to see DK64, Smash, Glover, and Rayman 2 on NSO soon? Do you see the games in the blurred image? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>
