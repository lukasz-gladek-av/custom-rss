<p>A Mario Party-style game and a co-op adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>LEGO fans are in for a treat with not one but two new titles announced today for the Switch and both are due out later this year.</p>
<p>First up we've got <strong>LEGO Voyagers</strong> - a new two-player co-op adventure all about "friendship and play". There'll even be a "Friend's Pass" a bit like Hazelight's games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>) where you can play together with just one copy of the game.</p>
<p>This title will be released by Annapurna Interactive and is once again "coming soon". Here's a bit more PR about it, and you can check out the official trailer above.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-3" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>A new adventure through "space, time, and the streets of Toronto"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some exciting news for Scott Pilgrim fans, with Tribute Games announcing it's teaming up with Universal and the series creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to release an "all-new, action-packed" video game entry on multiple platforms including the Switch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a></strong> is set to arrive in "early 2026" and will reimagine the fan-favourite universe with its modern approach to traditional brawlers. Here's some official PR about what exactly you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Players take on the role of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and more of the all-star crew to battle a variety of enemies in a warped version of Toronto overrun by demons, vegan henchmen and robots in an epic quest to save the city.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"With hard-hitting combat and explosive art, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX reinvents classic 2D brawling for a new era, blending high-energy action with fun character progression. Each of the seven playable characters features a full move set from the start, but players can customize their experience through upgradeable stats, and equippable special items making every fighter feel truly personal. Players will be able to dive into a brand-new storyline, co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games. They can also unleash creative combos, wield wild weapons, and brawl through co-op action—set to all-new music by Anamanaguchi —as <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX delivers a bold new chapter for longtime fans and newcomers alike."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the creator, who is deeply involved in this project, Anamanaguchi will also be returning to provide an explosive blend of 8-bit and "hyper-melodic rock". Pixel artist Paul Robertson is also helping out Tribute's in-house team on character animations and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off director and showrunner Ben David Grabinski is also on board as a creative consultant.</p>

<p>Four more fighters are on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the release of Elena as well as the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> this week, Capcom has now lifted the lid on the Year 3 paid DLC roster.</p>
<p>For this very special occasion, it's called on the help of pro wrestler and gaming fan Kenny Omega, who takes the spotlight in the above cinematic and gameplay trailer as each of the new fighters. So, here are the next batch of characters on the way to Street Fighter 6:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sagat - Summer 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>C. Viper - Autumn 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alex - Early Spring 2026</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ingrid - Late Spring 2026</strong><br></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to give Street Fighter 6 a go on the Switch 2, there's a free demo you can download from the eShop right now. It gives you access to the World Tour mode, along with the verse mode (including Gyro control matches).</p>
<p>Our review for Street Fighter 6 has also gone live here on Nintendo Life, if you're interested in finding out more about how the game runs on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>

<p>Another year, another Geoff</p>
</section></header><section>
<p>Okay, okay, we know you're incredibly busy right now playing the Switch 2. We understand, and it's all good.</p>
<p><em>However</em>. If you're interested in what this year's Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase has to offer, then you've come to the right place. We're streaming the event live right here when it all kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 2pm PDT / 3pm MDT / 4pm CDT / 5pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 10pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 11pm CEST / 12am (Sat) EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 6am (Sat) JST / 5am (Sat) AWST / 7am (Sat) AEST</li></ul>

<p>As for what might be announced, well... we don't really know right now. A lot of focus seems to be on Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> for the PS5, so we're fully expecting Geoff Keighley and Kojima to spend a good 10-15 minutes doing some sort of secret handshake on-stage.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a whole bunch of partners has been confirmed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-switch-2-listed-as-a-summer-game-fest-2025-partner">including 'Nintendo Switch 2'</a>, so it's likely we'll see a few notable announcements for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>So grab a snack, settle in, and enjoy... Or go back to playing Switch 2, whatever you want.</p>

<figure><a title="Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156558/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hitman_blood_money_-_reprisal">Hitman</a>! A rebooted and re-suited assassination spectacular that I once got in a spot of bother over (never reveal that you're gonna kill Sean Bean <em>in a computer game</em> on social media, lest people mistake it for a threat), has finally — and without the need for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hitman_3_-_cloud_version">cloud streaming technology</a> — made it to a Nintendo Switch console.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> release features all of the content that's previously been released for a trilogy of games that just gets better as it goes along. So yeah, there's an absolute ton of game to get stuck into here, no worries on that front. There was a lot of scope for the maestros over at IO Interactive to screw up somewhere along the line here, too, with so many moving parts, gadgets, mechanics, overlapping narrative aspects and audaciously big set pieces folded into a trio of huge adventures. This was a big old task they set themselves.</p>
<figure><a title="Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156562/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And so, we are some lucky beneficiaries, as the result of all that hard work is dynamite from start to finish, with any potential screw-ups neatly avoided. The vibe is exactly where it needs to be for this trilogy, and exactly where it needs to be to wash the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/hitman_absolution">Absolution</a> aftertaste from our mouths (not to mention those godawful movies). This is the <em>good</em> Hitman. The premium grade stuff. And it's a perfectly judged vibe that's melded with the dev's best work yet when it comes to mission/level design across all three games.</p>
<p>So let's start way back with the original <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/hitman">Hitman</a> reboot and work forward to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/hitman_3"><strong>Hitman 3</strong></a>'s epic, globe-trotting finale, shall we? The first thing to note, and one of the best things about how IO has approached these games since release, is that this 'World of Assassination' Signature Edition sees all of the games brought in line in terms of their controls and their visual/audio aspects. So you get a more seamless adventure, but it's also given them a sort of timeless quality (as far as games go in this regard), with the now 2016 first outing looking and playing as fresh as ever.</p>

<p>This first chunk of reboot had the unenviable task of giving Hitman fans something approaching the halcyon days of the good old save-scumming, trial-and-error, work-it-out-for-yourself Hitmans of yore. Never mind all the forced action sequences and linear crap of Absolution, us real hitmen want to die repeatedly, to throw ourselves time and time again against the sharp (and sometimes explode-y) edges of the great big puzzleboxes disguised as levels that we've got to run amok in here.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember being astounded the first time I saw the Paris 'Showstopper' mission from this game, the first actual real-time sortie that the suited and rebooted Agent 47 is sent on. It's a mission title with meaning for what IO has set out to do, and although the number of NPCs and the sheer amount of detail is much more commonplace nowadays, at the time it was one of the most audacious things I'd seen. What a spectacle, and what a treat to be able to freely walk around, examine and question, plot and plan in environs this spectacular.</p>
<figure><a title="Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156557/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It reminded me, in its pre-release demo form, of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/metal_gear_solid_v_ground_zeroes">Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes</a> in how it gave you everything you needed to know about the depth and intricacy of the full game (and luckily Hitman doesn't turn into half the mess MGSV did), whilst also being incredibly generous in that you could play it for days (weeks) thanks to how well-designed it was. It was showing off, basically.</p>
<p>From the dazzling opulence of this first scenario, we're then taken on a world tour that introduces us to a new kind of Hitman game, with online aspects and live service elements (the good kind) woven into the fabric of the campaign. Levels have been designed to be replayed and rediscovered, and even added to in new ways (elusive targets FTW) almost infinitely. Never just deadpan or serious, always cheeky, mischievous and full of ways to push and pull and the boundaries of level design. The old slapstick comedy has returned, the creativity, playfulness and time put aside for messing...it's all just as important as garroting some fool in a dank corridor, mate. Being a hitman has <em>layers,</em> and a lot of those layers involve dressing up silly and being a fool.</p>

<p>From Paris to Sapienza, Bangkok to Hawke's Bay, this is a sequence of sandbox missions that only ever gets bigger and — in most ways — better as it goes along. With controls and graphics now pretty much standardised across all three games, we then move seamlessly into the action of a sequel which, at the time of release at least, sort of felt a bit like DLC.</p>
<p>Of course, it was all part of a grander plan, and taken as part of the full trilogy contained in this version, it's an issue that's nullified. But if reviews were slightly cooler on this one at launch, I reckon it was mostly because it was so overbearingly familiar to what had come before. Not an issue of any sort if you're <em>into</em> what's on offer, of course.</p>
<p>What this sequel does give us is a whole bunch more amazing locations to mess around in. Standouts include the amazing F1-come-tech-show extravagance of Miami and a jaw-dropping recreation of a slice of Mumbai. Although it certainly doesn't proffer anything entirely new or surprising, it plays every bit as good, and gives us all the experimentation and laughs I could ask for. It's the sort of game, like all three really, that feels like you might never see it all, never actually 100% do <em>everything</em> you can.</p>

<p>With 2, however, it has to be said, any chance that the actual story that's spread across all three games would actually be a gripping one, fade away quite significantly. What's here narratively is really just a hodgepodge of bland secret agent tropes, with a little side of sci-fi nonsense. It's perhaps good, then, that I rarely have any clue why I'm killing who I'm killing, and I really don't care, as I prefer to just get lost in the act of roleplaying a very, very silly killer indeed.</p>
<p>Hitman 3, the most recent part of the package, is easily my favourite part of the lot. There are a string of excellent missions here; from the opening <strong>Knives Out</strong>-styled cracker in a posh mansion full of liars, to a Berlin bunker-cum-nightclub that's jam-packed to the rafters with incidents and accidents waiting to happen, and the opulence — again just straight up showing off, really — of an Argentinian vineyard level that had me bowing to the video game gods. My goodness, my friends, you are in for a treat if you've yet to play any of these games. What a package.</p>

<p>It's also an incredibly exciting prospect to be able to take all these grand missions, elusive targets, challenges and escalation contracts on-the-go with a portable system that's actually capable of playing them. I mean, it is capable, right?</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that the game has arrived on Switch 2 in <em>decent</em> form overall, it's certainly very playable and looking the business. In handheld mode, we've got what <em>seems</em> to be 720p with an unlocked frame rate, whereas in docked the resolution is upped to 1080p. The frame rate though, as it is unlocked, can be a bit of a relentless issue - there's no getting around it.</p>
<p>In docked mode you can really feel the dips down to the 30s, and in handheld — whilst not as bad — it's definitely there. Hopefully we'll see a patch or two, but at launch the performance is <em>playable</em>, fine in most places, but with some stutters that cannot be ignored. I would have expected 60fps solid in docked here, so it's going to depend on how you cope with dips on this front.</p>

<p>In terms of image quality, it all looks good, whilst not up to the shininess of its fanciest variants running on more powerful hardware, obviously. There are some jaggies and the image can look a little blurred at times as the resolution fluctuates. It's such a shame about the frame rate issues, as in every other way this is an impressive port. It may not look as nice as a super-PC equivalent, but it's still up there.</p>
<p>Another, and potentially bigger issue, though, depending on how online you are, is that the game seems to save your progress for online and offline activities separately. This means that if you are going portable without a connection to the internet for a time, you won't carry over your progress to your online save file, and vice versa. Oh dear. Let's hope this can be remedied with a patch, too.</p>
<p>Overall, then, a fantastic, almost <em>endlessly</em> playable collection of Hitman games have made the jump to Switch 2 with all content intact. But! It's not without its issues at launch. We need a patch or some sort of fix for the frame rate drops as soon as possible and the online/offline save problem really needs to be remedied somehow. We'll add a note here if such an update should materialise.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is a stunning collection of games that sees Agent 47 at his absolute best. With multiplayer aspects woven seamlessly and smartly into the mix, tons of ways to approach every mission, and some of the best level design in the biz, this is a bonafide belter, no questions asked.</p>
<p>However, this Switch 2 port — as things stand at launch — does need some work to fix its stuttering issues, especially in docked mode, as they are just a little too notable for comfort. Still highly playable, but with some performance problems, then. Let's hope we see improvements in the form of a patch or two ASAP.</p></section>
