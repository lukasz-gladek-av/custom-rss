<p>Although this is a soundtrack dating back to the Game Boy era, it's actually packed with 33 tracks (some of those are brief sound bytes, but there's still plenty to listen to). Combined, the album has a total runtime of 24 minutes. It's filled with bangers like Birabuto Kingdom BGM and Muda Kingdom BGM.</p>

<p>Here's the the full tracklist of this 1989/90 Game Boy release:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Birabuto Kingdom BGM</em></li>

<p>To listen to this music on the Nintendo Music app, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription. If you want to play this game, it's also available on the 'Nintendo Classics' Game Boy library for Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>This follows Nintendo releasing a "year in review" feature for the Nintendo Music app last week. It allows users to see their most-played tracks, playlist and soundtrack. Nintendo also recently added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yoshis_crafted_world">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> soundtrack to the app as well as a "special" sample of tracks from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>

This one is much smaller following the big 1.4.0 update at the start of December.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect from Version 1.4.1, according to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world">official Nintendo support page</a>. If there is anything else going on behind the scenes with this latest update, we'll let you know.</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World: Ver. 1.4.1 (Released December 15, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player disconnects and reconnects a controller, the game may not progress as normal.
<ul>
<li>When this issue occurs, there are times when ghost data from Time Trials will be deleted without warning from “View Rankings.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>You can see the Version 1.4.0 update in our previous post. It included course layout changes for specific modes, music-related updates, item adjustments, online updates, and fixed multiple issues.</p>

<p>Free update and free upgrade confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Before the talented developer Team Cherry signs off for 2025, it's got <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">some exciting news</a> to share. The "first big" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> expansion is already in the works and is scheduled to arrive in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This new content, officially titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow</a>, will come packed with new areas, bosses, tools and much more. Perhaps, best of all, it's free to all players when it arrives next year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’ll keep further details a secret for now, but expect additional info shortly before <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow</em> releases."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Alongside this, the team has revealed <strong>seven million</strong> people have now purchased Silksong (alongside "millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass").</p>
<figure data-uuid="f453c2162a928"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f453c2162a928/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to the expansion, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> game will also be getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This will incorporate all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the new platform, including "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions and many additional graphical effects".</p>
<p>If you already own the Switch version of this title, you'll be able to download the Switch 2 release for free when it launches in 2026. In the lead up to this, Team Cherry is also updating the original game for current platforms with added features and bug fixes, and says it's got "even more plans" for next year.</p>
<p>Various Hollow Knight game sales will also be appearing across storefronts during the holiday season, so if you haven't already played these titles, you'll be able to get them at a discounted price.</p>
