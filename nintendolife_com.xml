<p>There's been some fairly heated debate since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, over the remastered collection's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">hefty price tag</a>. It's quite a lot of money for a pair of Wii games, as absolutely phenomenal as they are, there's no getting around it.</p>
<p>However, we do already know that the games present at 4K/1080p on Switch 2 (1080p docked on Switch 1), and that they offer up a sprinkling of new features such as a new Assist Mode, a new chapter of Rosalina's storybook, amiibo support, and what's described as "visual enhancements". How very vague of you, Nintendo.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a> has already been re-released not so long ago as part of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection on Switch, and it's this version that those fine folk over at <a href="https://youtu.be/wOF6b0HgxCA?si=v1yUJir69RRo0CpC">GVG</a> have been checking out in a comparison video that gives us hope that we'll get a little more for our money than Nintendo was being clear about.</p>
<p>You can check out the full video above, which includes a playthrough comparison of the five minutes of Super Mario Galaxy's latest port (on Switch) as posted on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Super-Mario-Galaxy-Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915270.html">Nintendo UK's website</a> versus the one we got with Super Mario 3D All-Stars, giving better examples of texture work that's been done than "visual enhancements" really gets across. Just check out the cobblestones in the area shown below as Mario lands; there's a big difference in the detail.</p>

<p>Cutscenes have also been properly re-rendered this time out, rather than upscaled, which introduced some banding issues in the 3D All-Stars collection - they're now gone, according to GVG. Oh, and the aspect ratio has also been changed to fill the screen. Nice.</p>
<p>Another interesting point to note here is that all the footage on Nintendo's site, it seems, is from the Switch versions of the games, so we've yet to actually get a look at just how they'll appear with the full Switch 2 treatment. Fingers crossed we're in for more of a surprise from these re-releases than first appeared.</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to Super Mario Galaxy 1 + Super Mario Galaxy 2 when they release on the 2nd of October? Think the price is still too much? Make sure to let us know all your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>
