            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="SIWIQU S3 MAX TV Dock Station For Nintendo Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0706b57b5d6ff/siwiqu-s3-max-tv-dock-station-for-nintendo-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's own dock is a non-nonsense device that just works. You slide your console in, crack the Joy-Con off, and boom, you're off to the races. Given the larger size of Switch 2, though, its dock is a substantial slab of black plastic and various third-party firms have stepped in with offerings that are a little more portable.</p>
<p>Antank is one such company, and the S3 MAX TV Dock Station for Nintendo Switch 2 — also known as the SIWIQU Dock Station in some parts — is certainly smaller than the dock that comes with the console. Weighing in at 109 grams (compared to 383 grams), you'll barely notice you're carrying it in your satchel, backpack, or anywhere else you care to secrete your hardware.</p>
<p>Antack sent me the standard model for review, although they have another one that includes an Ethernet port for wired internet connection. Otherwise, on the back of the dock, you get the expected ports: two USB-A slots, a USB-C port for the power, an HDMI port going to your TV, and a button to switch between TV-out and the Switch 2's own display. Beyond the dock itself, in the box you get a little foldout manual with the tiniest text I've ever seen, and that's your lot.</p>

<p>For $35.99 / £28.99, it should come as no surprise that you're not getting Nintendo-level build quality and materials, and the lightness here doesn't help sell the S3 as a premium bit of kit, either. But it's fine; the red and blue end caps match up with the accents around the Joy-Con, and sitting beside your TV, it looks pleasant enough.</p>
<p>You're also not getting an AC power adapter, the requisite cable, or an HDMI cable, and Antack recommends using Nintendo's official gear. If you've got a Switch 2, you'll obviously have that already, but if you're buying this as a cheap dock for a second room, you'll need to factor into your budget another $34.99 / £24.99 for the power adapter, plus an HDMI 2.1 cable (the ultra high speed variety).</p>
<p>Setup is as simple as you'd expect. Connect the cables, turn your TV on, and boom. It works. In fact, I had to reconnect the console a couple of times — apparently a quirk that's been ironed out with <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update">a firmware update</a> I've subsequently run according to the <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update-guide-for-windows">instructions on Antack's website</a> — but then it just functioned as advertised.</p>

<p>A little blue LED on the front indicates that everything's powered up. The S3 supports 4K (8K, in fact, according to the blurb, although you won't get that out of your Switch and I've got no way to display 8K content) and up to 120Hz output - although the Switch 2 can only manage 120fps at 1080p, and you'll need a 120Hz+-capable TV, naturally. Several hours of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> delivered image quality on a 55-inch LG OLED that looked indistinguishable from the official dock to my eyes. HDR fired up just as with the standard offering, and everything just worked.</p>
<p>Back to the unit itself, Antank's website blurb mentions a "spring-buffered docking port", although I can't see any evidence of a spring on my unit. The connection at the bottom is totally rigid and fits the console port snugly once you seat the thing correctly, which can take a couple of tries.</p>
<p>Having the system 'unsheathed', you'll definitely note the heat it's pumping out in a way you may not when it's resting in Nintendo's dock. The S3 effectively blocks the console's air intakes along the bottom edge, which gave me pause, but temperature-wise, the fact that the system isn't wrapped in black plastic helps disperse heat from the casing and "provides better cooling than the original charging dock", according to Antank. I don't have the equipment to measure that, unfortunately, and I'd question if the cooling is 'better' than Nintendo's dock, but it seemed roughly the same to me from a volume and temperature perspective.</p>
<p>Switching to handheld mode by hitting the round button on the rear, I noticed the console's fan whirring up more in the summer heat. Given the fact that you can charge via the top USB-C port anyway, I'd prefer to have those intakes uncovered in tabletop mode, personally. Yes, a cable sticking out the top isn't aesthetically pleasing, but I'd rather not tax my still-relatively-new system more than necessary when it's not outputting to the TV. Perhaps I'm being overly cautious, but honestly, I don't see much point in the tabletop button when that's built into the console as-is.</p>

<p>The size reduction is a boon, certainly, but the S3 does come with some minor irritations. Firstly, you'll need to hold the dock down before pulling to remove the console - there's no slide-in/slide-out here. The tight fit means that the S3 doesn't work with third-party cases, either, so you'll need to remove them beforehand. Also, the dock doesn’t seem to communicate with the TV to wake it from standby, if that’s something you’re used to with the standard dock.</p>
<p>While three rubber 'feet' prevent it from slipping, the dock relies on the power and HDMI cables being connected to provide stability and prevent everything toppling backwards at the slightest touch. Obviously, the Switch 2 has its own kickstand, so using the S3 as a makeshift stand doesn't make sense anyway - just be cautious when you're setting things up and don't put your system in the dock until the cables are connected.</p>
<p>And that's it. It's definitely more of a travel accessory in my eyes; if I were in the market for a second dock for the home, I'd probably pay the extra for the slide-in/out convenience (and the necessary cables) of the official option. If you're the kind of person eager to travel as light as possible, or who feels a missed opportunity when playing your Switch 2 in the shadow of a big hotel-room TV, the S3 might be for you, though.</p>
<p>And even factoring in the necessary extras, you're still a fair way off the $124.99 / £92.99 that Nintendo wants for a second dock with those essentials included. For the budget-conscious gamer, then, or travellers who fancy being able to hook up on the fly, it's a good option.</p>

<h3>"monthly minimum" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Game-key cards and fans that don't earn in Pounds, Euros or Dollars.<br>
Hello Nintendolife friends! Sebastián here from Medellín, Colombia (a big fan from the Global South).<br>
I'd like to talk about why you'd think that Game-key cards are better or worse for your own gaming experience.<br>
For context, videogames are really expensive when exchanged to Colombian Pesos, up to a fifth of our monthly minimum wage.<br>
Fortunately, I earn much more than a minimum wage, but it's still a luxury. So I buy Nintendo games based on 3 options:<br>
1) Physical cartridges that I'd like to collect (or play in the future with our soon to come kid); 2) Physical cartridges that I can play and then re-sell to earn some of the investment back; 3) Digital games on sale for a really low price based on Deku Deals' price history.<br>
Considering Nintendo's tendency to introduce more games as Game-key cards, my interest in physical games is every time smaller, which takes some of the magic away.<br>
What's your take on this? How much is a game compared to your monthly minimum wage in the UK?<br>
¡Saludos desde Colombia!<strong><br>
Sebas.</strong><br>
P.S: Please be sure to share some comment in Spanish, it would be great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hola Sebastián! According to <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/national-minimum-wage/">Money Saving Expert</a>, assuming a 35-hour work week, the monthly minimum wage in the UK works out to around £1850 right now. Using DK Bananza (£66.99, physical) as a recent example, that would be just over 3.5% of our monthly wage. That's before tax, mind you.</p>
<p>For me, I went digital almost exclusively on Switch 1, and those puny Switch cards could never compete with the majesty of a chunky N64 cart anyway, so for me physical hasn't been very magical for a while. The deep eShop sales and the convenience of having my library instantly accessible made sense to me on a portable system, and I don't regret it.</p>
<p>However, though I get the attraction of being able to resell, Game-Key Cards still feel like the absolute worst of all worlds to me, designed purely to benefit publishers and pass storage costs on to consumers. No me caen bien. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I'd go so far"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morning/afternoon/evening or whatever time you're reading this. (If you're reading this after midnight, respect to my fellow night owl).</p>
<p>Is it just me (probably not) that thinks that there are some games that are so so good that it's an absolute crime that they're not more well known? My personal example is the whole of the Blaster Master Zero trilogy. The writing is spot on, the gameplay is smooth and gets better throughout all three games, the trilogy leads up to a really satisfying and heartwarming, yet bittersweet conclusion that I'd go so far as to compare to Undertale.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>And it's a genuine shame that even after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDJSziIiD34">NovaZone's video on it on Youtube</a>, I haven't seen much more buzz about it. Best thing is, all three games together you can get for less than £30 even without a sale.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. And play Blaster Master Zero. That is all.<br>

<p>Thanks to you, Lewis, I get to trot out my semi-regular plug for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/just_shapes_and_beats">Just Shapes &amp; Beats</a>. Everyone should play that game. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"the main personalities"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So I noticed a long standing trend of Nintendo life staff adapting other writers' reviews for the video version. I understand that maybe the main personalities on Nintendo life can’t possibly play every major game thoroughly enough to put down their review, but the other issue I see is sometimes the video reviews come across like it’s your personally experience when it really isn’t. Or a reviewer puts in personal info into the review (eg. Mario Kart World) that doesn’t really make sense out of context. So my question - why not have these other reviewers also do the video version? Is it simply they aren’t as much of a personality or video reviews aren’t their thing? Thanks for answering!<br>

<p>For one, we've got a three-person YouTube team who earn their beans from making videos and whose expertise in that department outstrips everyone else on staff by a very wide margin. Capture cards and mics are the least of it - it's a different skillset, and while some of our writers may have the ability, Alex, Felix, and Zion have the know-how, gear, and camera charisma to deliver the best results in the speediest time.</p>
<p>And yes, some of us are just better in writing. Ask my wife. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"entertaining but useless"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good evening and tsufufum to you, NL,</p>
<p>Inspired by your recent nostalgic trip through the pages of NGC Magazine, I was compelled to do the same, taking about six weeks to chew my way through all 61 issues under the NGC banner. As I went through each issue, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oig6a5UFcypa8GO13yC-PHxOtb_ZO3w7U0tYzBsISGk/edit?usp=sharing">I compiled a spreadsheet of every review</a> featured so I could more easily refer back at a later date, and having now finished I am sharing this document in case it is useful to you as well.</p>
<p>Each review is listed with the issue it appears in and the score awarded, plus some feeble attempt from me to label the game with a genre. Of course, the real reason you read NGC is for their spectacular way with words, and a dry spreadsheet would be meaningless without paying heed to that, so I have also included snippets of many of the reviews in the manner of their (and your!) letters pages.</p>
<p>Also part of the document is a tab of "interesting" features. What counts as interesting obviously varies from one person to another so it's got a definite slant towards things I am interested in myself, but I've tried to highlight features that might also be of interest to the retro public at large... like the reported Pilotwings title being developed by Factor 5, and their repeated insistence that "Nintendo DS" was a temporary name. Oops!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Finally is a list of their fake games, seen as examples in features like their Directory. Often crass, they're mostly jabs at the various staff members who wrote the mag. This tab would probably be reviewed as "entertaining but useless".</p>
<p>I would encourage anyone with even a passing interest in the Gamecube-DS era to take a look into NGC. They were scrappy, chaotic and anarchic, far moreso than their contemporaries, and the magazine has a lot of personality as a result. It's also just fun to look back on old things that were new at the time and see how things have changed (and how they've stayed the same). Their speculation on what Mario's waterpumping backpack did, what Rare would do after Starfox Adventures, the inevitability of Wind Waker 2, and what Nintendo's "third pillar" would come to be, is all entertaining when read with the benefit of living in the future. At the very least, you'll learn some new words to call your friends.</p>
<p>I wonder if any NGC alumni are around and available for interview? I'd love to read some 20-years-later gossip about how things actually ran, if Greener regrets giving Melee 95% (he was right!), and if Shedwards still has his pigs. Not including that Ed guy, of course- he already works for NL.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the words, NL. You are the ship I jumped to when NGC sank, and I'm grateful that you in some manner keep that 100% Unofficial spirit alive.</p>
<p>Beebs<strong><br>

</blockquote>
<p>Eyy, now you're speaking my language! N64 Magazine was my 'era' (and is the reason I'm here doing this today), with that talent and spirit flowing very directly into NGC, just as Super Play fed into N64. Thank you for this - and for the massive compliment.</p>
<p>Alumni-wise, I've had plans for something vaguely in this area for a long while now. It'll be a ways off, but keep the googly eyes peeled.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm off to play some Baldy's Pate. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"before the torches arrive"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, this probably won’t go well with NL readers, but we need to talk about Game Key cards. Is it necessary to complain about them every single time a new game is announced?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I understand the issue for game collectors and game preservation, but as a business practice it’s nothing new. Also, players across all platforms purchase far more digital games than physical these days.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>For those of us that have gone digital only for several years now, the constant complaint for Game Key cards feel similar to complaining about the lack of discs when new albums are released in Spotify or something.</p>
<p>I support you in your criticism of Game Key cards and I’ll keep reading the articles and watching the videos regardless if you mention Game Key or not. It just annoys me since I don’t agree that it’s as relevant to the average Nintendo gamer as the community makes it sound.</p>
<p>Now excuse me as I find somewhere to hide before the torches arrive. Thank you!<strong><br>
RenanKJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are rubbish, though, no?</p>
<p>Sure, it's irritating when people demand two points docked from a review score because Game Key-Card, as if modern games haven't been shipping with massive required downloads for a couple of generations. But if people want to voice their displeasure in a respectful manner, let's not crack out the copium just yet. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I expect more"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How long has Sakarai needed a break for? Everytime his name comes up, any YouTuber or Journalist or random comment poster will say "Ah give that guy a break, he's worked too much." Well guess what? He had his break. The last DLC for Super Smash Bros Ultimate was released in October 2021. So it's time we stopped cutting the guy slack, he's rested and ready and it's about time he made Kirby Air Riders and then about time he made another Smash Bros after that! He is only 55, so I expect more and I don't feel guilty saying so. So come on Sakurai, let's have some more games son!<strong><br>

<p>You hear that, <em>Slakurai?</em> Doing your little dev tutorial vids out of your own pocket for the benefit of the wider gaming and dev community. Everyone was here, and now they're leaving because you're off on a jolly. Get back down that there Smash dungeon where you belong!...</p>
<p><sub>Just thinking about another Smash makes me age like I've drunk from the wrong grail. Get out, man. Get out while you still can!</sub> <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<p><em>"</em>I had a random idea a while back: Nintendo should start producing its own anime. Hear me out: a high school romance where a boy and girl bond over their love of the Nintendo Switch. An anime adaptation of Akira Himekawa's Twilight Princess manga. How about an adaptation of the Splatoon manga while they're at it? And don't forget the potential of an Xenoblade anime either. I would watch all of those." - <strong>ShieldHero</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
