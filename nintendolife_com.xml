<figure data-uuid="436cf77138e7c"><a title="Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/436cf77138e7c/z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since The Pokémon Company uttered the name <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, one idea has obsessively swirled around my mind: I <em>needed</em> to declare my favourite Pokémon for each letter in the alphabet, in reverse alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Anyone else? Just me? <em>And why?</em> I don’t know, because what I thought would be a fun, breezy exercise ended up being an endless toil of picking between my favourite children. It taught me what a Pokémon must feel when inflicted with paralysis.</p>
<p>In the end, there could only be 26 winners, though. These were the victors.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fykzpoh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<div><div><h2>Z: Zorua</h2>
<figure data-uuid="ffab312bf9898"><a title="Z" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ffab312bf9898/z.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Zorua is the rare Pokémon that’s never felt like a commodity. True to its nature as an elusive master of illusions, this sly fox has remained difficult to obtain in most games it's appeared in, making it still feel special a decade and a half since its debut.</p>
<p>If I could have one Pokémon as a pet, Zorua would be the one, if only for the mischief that would ensue.</p>
</div><div><h2>Y: Yamask</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c2938a1fa899c"><a title="Y" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c2938a1fa899c/y.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pokémon has plenty of monsters that become quite disturbing once you learn their nature, but Yamask just about takes the cake.</p>
<p>It’s quite literally a human soul that carries around a mask of its former face. This begs some questions, such as why every human that turned into a Yamask looked the same, but my spine is tingling enough without going there.</p>
</div><div><h2>X: Xerneas</h2>
<figure data-uuid="892fa3ad3e75d"><a title="X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/892fa3ad3e75d/x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I never had a chance to catch Xerneas as Generation VI is the only mainline entry that I didn’t play through to completion (I’ll carry that great shame). However, that doesn’t stop me from adoring its handsome majesty.</p>
<p>Many people have drawn the comparison between it and the Forest Spirit in <strong>Princess Mononoke</strong>, and as I see it, Game Freak was doing something right if it’s getting comparisons to Studio Ghibli.</p>
</div><div><h2>W: Wiglett</h2>
<figure data-uuid="30ea5145bcbcf"><a title="W" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30ea5145bcbcf/w.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Do I like Wiglett because it’s an absolutely ridiculous pseudo-variant-but-not-actually of Diglett? You bet.</p>
<p>Do I take Wiglett seriously? Absolutely not, but that’s also why I love this notoriously long white eel and its clown nose (mouth?). They knew what they were doing here.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:153789 @ 1759610184 -->
</div><div><h2>V: Vikavolt</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0b157de233a2e"><a title="V" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b157de233a2e/v.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>When you catch an unassuming Grubbin at the start of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon">Sun &amp; Moon</a>, you don’t expect to wait through a majority of the game for it to evolve to its final form.</p>
<p>However, Vikavolt is all the more special for the love and time investment. It became a powerful force in my first playthrough’s Elite 4 team, the only time I can recall a bug-type Pokémon making that cut.</p>
</div><div><h2>U: Umbreon</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e24f6757d26df"><a title="U" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e24f6757d26df/u.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold &amp; Silver</a> released, I was at a point in my boyhood where the rule of cool reigned supreme. This meant I loved dark types, and chief among these was Umbreon.</p>
<p>Turns out I never grew out of that phase, as this Eeveelution still has that same impact on me to this day. It exudes a cool, collected mystique and slight threat of brutality that pairs perfectly with just how adorable it is. Maybe I’d take an Umbreon as a pet over a Zorua, actually.</p>
</div><div><h2>T: Typhlosion</h2>
<figure data-uuid="48f0cc155efd5"><a title="T" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/48f0cc155efd5/t.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I feel like Typhlosion’s goofy 3D model with its flame collar retracted makes you either love it more or feel like it lost its edge. That unintentional duality makes me fall squarely in the former camp.</p>
<p>This lanky bipedal badger keeps it chill when it’s not turning up the heat, making it the perfect companion to start your Johto journey with. (Though, as a self-proclaimed water trainer back in the day, it was regrettably not my pick. Speaking of which…)</p>
</div><div><h2>S: Squirtle</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e8772f3e601cf"><a title="S" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8772f3e601cf/s.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 'S' category is unbelievably stacked for me, yet Squirtle still clears with ease. The turtle was my #1 from the moment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> came to North America. I’ll never forget lugging a gargantuan Squirtle pillow with me everywhere for a good year in the late 1990s. There’s no beating a core memory like that.</p>
<p>This is why some of us will never entirely grow past Generation 1.</p>
</div><div><h2>R: Rattata</h2>
<figure data-uuid="31d0dfc450d88"><a title="R" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31d0dfc450d88/r.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think Rattata is the 'R' Pokémon most people would even consider singling out, and definitely not the one I expected to pick coming into this list. But, core memories once again kicked in, this time regarding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/evolving-with-pokemon-how-the-games-helped-me-navigate-a-confused-childhood">my cul-de-sac adventures</a> where neighbourhood kids would call me “Rattatray.”</p>
<p>I hated it then, but it’s only made me grow more affectionate to the little guy over the years. We know the same mockery.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:163492 @ 1759610184 -->
</div><div><h2>Q: Quagsire</h2>
<figure data-uuid="642a2cdb43162"><a title="Q" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/642a2cdb43162/q.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The selection of 'Q' Pokémon is admittedly lacking, but don’t let that fool you into thinking Quagsire hasn’t earned its spot on this list. This unassuming, friendly doofus loafs about without a care in the world. At this moment in history, I have to admit I’m envious.</p>
</div><div><h2>P: Pikachu</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4d2c701117765"><a title="P" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4d2c701117765/p.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think you’ll find many people who dislike Pikachu, but I wonder how many dedicated fans would actually consider it a favourite. I guess you can count me as one.</p>
<p>Its mascot status has afforded it an amount of personality and depictional variety that is unmatched among its over 1,000 peers. I’ll never get sick of its overpowered anime antics, or its many costumes (<a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10086-101/pikachu-celebrations-intern-pikachu-poke-plush-7-in?srsltid=AfmBOopt-75AOXGFt3kGOijLDGzvPGhFxSA5AzHyH6cT07Kn4RQcyclt">Business Pikachu</a> forever), or actors in bouncy Pikachu costumes swarming the streets of Japanese cities in unison. It’s iconic for a reason.</p>
</div><div><h2>O: Ogerpon</h2>
<figure data-uuid="bf6bbd262125b"><a title="O" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf6bbd262125b/o.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I wish detractors of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> would experience its first DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet_-_the_teal_mask">The Teal Mask</a>, as a stand-alone story since Ogerpon’s plight is genuinely heart-wrenching. It hit me hard enough that I couldn’t bring myself to box this humanoid creature after unshackling it from ire. A Pokémon that can do that surely has similarly earned its place on this list.</p>
<p>It helps that its mask-swapping mechanic is one of my favourites in the series, as it allows Ogerpon to fit into whatever typing niche I need to fill.</p>
</div><div><h2>N: Ninetales</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c23fdb04df6c8"><a title="N" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c23fdb04df6c8/n.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Most people are aware of the importance of kitsune in Japanese folklore, but did you know the most powerful among them have nine tails? That makes Ninetales’ existence pretty on-the-nose, but also standard fare when it comes to depictions of the folkloric creature.</p>
<p>Yet it has a simple majesty to it that still hits hard all these years later. Plus, its wispy Alolan variant may just be the best regional variant to date, and one of the more unique kitsune on the market.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159356/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>We reported on the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kuukiyomi-4-consider-it-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It</a> having arrived with new features, including a bunch of exclusive mouse-mode content, and as a result of that, well, I agreed in writing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/random-kuukiyomi-4-consider-its-switch-2-edition-uses-mouse-mode-in-neat-ways-while-poking-fun-at-nintendo">in the comments</a> that I'd review it. Thanks, past me. Thanks a bunch.</p>
<p>I jest, of course. This is an off-kilter Japanese series that had completely passed me by, and after seeing the Switch 2 port trailer, I simply had to give it a go. It's right up my street.</p>
<p>So, what have we actually got here? Well, Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It is the latest in a series that has already seen a few releases on Switch 1, and the entire concept revolves around you being placed in situations where you must <em>consider</em> a suitable action or solution to often awkward — or just plain weird — social situations. Will you consider being considerate? Or will you take every opportunity you can to mess people around?</p>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159357/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a coming together of a very funny art style here; it's the sort of game that does a very good line in incredibly stupid facial expressions that amuse whilst also nailing precisely an awkward feeling, with situations that manage to raise, at the very least, a wry smile. You can see the pain in the eyes of these NPCs at points. The terror of human interaction writ large. I can't stop laughing.</p>
<p>Starting with the original game's contents, which you play with the Switch 2's normal, non-exclusive inputs, you push through some 100 scenarios that, well, I'm not going to spoil many of them here, because the entire fun is in seeing what comes next. But I have howled at my screen a few times due to the underlying social tension being nagged at.</p>
<p>This is a game that asks us, "Why do humans read the air?" And those facial expressions I was just on about, combined with the oddness of the scenarios, and then multiplied by the very real awkward silence (we all know the one) that transpires as you consider what to do...man, this game nails the squeaky bum tension so hard.</p>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159362/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Will you shift seats on a train to let a couple sit together? Will you put your dirty mouth around the water font and drink from it when nobody is looking? Will you sit at the table beside the girl in the cafe or go sit alone at the bar? I'm sweating already.</p>
<p>Alongside these social aspects, you also have lots of curveballs, one or two of which I'll admit to not really even understanding, and honestly, there's something about sweating over sitting next to a stranger one moment, and then moving your Joy-Con around to simulate trying to find a Wi-Fi phone signal the next, that really brings things right down to the level of crushing reality. In the best way possible, you understand.</p>
<p>Playing through the game's scenarios in the main solo campaign mode, you'll be graded after every handful of levels to ascertain just how considerate you are being, or as the game puts it, your "ability to read the atmosphere will be diagnosed."</p>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159358/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where the main sticking point with this game will be. You see, it's not taking itself particularly seriously, and so even when you're presented with the ludicrously in-depth results of your attempts to be nice, it's mostly all played for laughs. So don't expect to find seriousness for even a second. It's really all just for japes, and so there may not be enough of a hook for those who don't gel with the humour. Luckily, I'm covered in gel right now.</p>
<p>Aside from the vanilla game's 100 main mode scenarios, you also get a 'Consider It Together' multiplayer mode that asks you and your associates a bunch of questions before diagnosing your 'compatibility', plus a handful of quick games that you'll unlock as you play (again, no spoilers) and a few extra minigames to boot. So there's plenty to do, even before you add in the Switch 2's new sections, where the mouse mode fun happens.</p>
<p>In the main new mode, you use either one of your Joy-Con in mouse mode to navigate 20 new levels, and I'm happy to report that they are some of the best in the entire thing. Mostly aimed at the console itself, I got a lot of laughs out of cheeky takes on 120fps gaming, how the console's mic works, and what HDR stands for.</p>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159361/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's all very silly and delightfully tongue-in-cheek. The Switch 2 port also lands with five two-player mouse-made games to play against a pal for added value. Again, I'm not going to ruin them here, as seeing what pops onto the screen next is what it's all about.</p>
<p>Being that the art style is so stark and spartan, there are zero issues in terms of performance, and really the only negative that I'd level at Kuukiyomi 4 is that, as much as it's great that it doesn't take anything too seriously, it does have an inherent lack of focus or drive. If you want something with some challenge, this is not that, even if it does let you re-run and improve your results. However, even this has been remedied to a degree in the NS2 Edition by the addition of achievements, which give you something to work towards, whilst also providing a few more laughs by challenging you to consider it in some not-so-obvious ways. Did I just unlock a 'cheevo' for letting my head fall all the way to one side during a haircut? You're goddamn right I did.</p>

<p>Given its cheerful pricing, honestly, it's a hard thing to knock if you're looking for some cheap laughs that can also hit home harder than you'll expect at points.</p>
<p>Now, prepare to relive the unbearable tension of...moving out of the way to let someone off the train!</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It! is a delightfully silly little game that also provides plenty of dark laughs, clever digs, and unbearable social tension thanks to a brilliantly executed collection of scenarios.</p>
<p>Not every level is gonna have you howling, and some of them don't even really make any sense, but I'll be damned if I haven't been well-entertained for my money and made to laugh plenty whilst also being reminded that, at best, I am deeply inconsiderate.</p></section>

And this is the first edition since Switch 2 launched!</p>
<p>While we've done our utmost to keep up with every new Switch 2 game after 25 of them dropped on 5th June, there have already been a handful we weren't able to cover - although we <em>did</em> manage to catch up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">Bokura: Planet</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kuukiyomi-4-consider-it-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Kuukiyomi 4</a>, both of which we enjoyed immensely (spoilers for the Kuukiyomi review that'll be going live later today!). And Switch 1 has kept up its relentless release rate, with publishers pumping out all sorts of jewels glinting in the ever-churning eShop slop. Missing some good 'uns is unavoidable, unfortunately.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vimkzj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Remember — and this is a point that is frequently forgotten when people send their recommendations! — <strong>we won't be reviewing these games</strong>. We want to shine a light on games that we weren't able to when they launched. Make sure to carefully read the submission guidelines below if you want to see your entries included in the feature:</p>
<h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>100-word limit</strong> - Keep it brief! A history of the genre and deep-dive into every mechanic is unnecessary. Concentrate on what the game is about, what sets it apart from other games, and why you enjoyed it.</li>
<li><strong>One entry per game</strong> - Feel free to send your thoughts on multiple games, but there's no need to duplicate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose only games that we haven't reviewed on the site</strong> - To check if a Nintendo Life review exists, simply type the name of the game into the search box at the very top of the page (look for the magnifying glass icon in the top left corner) and click on the game page that appears. If there's no review, and it doesn't appear in a previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/reader-recommendations">Reader Recommendations</a> feature (which will also appear on the game page if it exists), you're good to go!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a recommendation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=gems"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Switch eShop Hidden Gems"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted message into the appropriate box, hit send, and Bob's your uncle!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'll hopefully get back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - it's had an update since I last played, so I'm interested to see what effect that's had. I'm also keen to crack into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> is sitting on my home screen, giving me a cheeky little wink every time I fire up my Switch. It'd be rude not to.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I've had a copy of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/last_guardian">The Last Guardian</a> sitting under the TV for about a year, and with GOTY approaching <em>of course</em> the urge to play games totally unrelated to 2025 is gripping me. Hey, I just finished 2017's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, so why not try a winner from 2016 next? <em>*head in hands*</em></p>
<p>Actually, my instinct is to ignore games completely this weekend and deep-dive into videos, specifically YouTube videos featuring our recently departed (from the company - he's okay, everyone!) Zion<del>-from-Nintendo-Life</del>. The video chaps do such brilliant work, yet I often don't have the time to properly check it out. Having watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qQv6IDHAvM">his last chat video</a>, I'm itching to go back into the archives and (re)watch some of the many brilliant videos Zion's created over the years. Top man, that Mr. Z. He will be missed.</p>
<p>(Just to reiterate, he ain't dead - we'll absolutely be keeping in touch!)</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks.</p>

<p>I'm still playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> this weekend, because of course I am. What a game, man. I'm also keen to play a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, but I feel like I might need to put that one off a bit until I'm in the right mood.</p>
<p>I also got Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, so that's on my radar. Again, I've got a lot on right now, so chances are I'll probably just chill out with some Galaxy 2 before I get properly invested in a new game.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m away in Paris this weekend, so Switchin’ might have to take a backseat for a little while, but it feels fitting that the hours spent on the Eurostar are filled with a game all about <em>love</em>. Okay, it’s Hades II and okay, I don’t actually know whether it’s all that much about love, but it does feature Aphrodite, the goddess of love, so that has to carry my imagery some way, right?</p>
<p>Either way, I’ve only got a couple of roguelike runs under my belt at this point, but <em>boy</em> does it feel good to be back in a Hades mood! Getting to grips with attacks, building up my weapons arsenal, wooing gods with Nectar, this is all the good stuff that I’ll be looking fondly back on in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Death to Chronos, and all that, dear readers. Have a good one!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>An excellent mech game that I skipped last week has will be my go-to game this weekend. I have about half the missions cleared on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gearbits">Gearbits</a> and I hope to tackle the remaining ones before Monday hits. Hades II progress continues, with every run brining another titbit to the story of Melinoë. Hope to find some time to revisit both Mario Galaxies, really fond memories of a simpler time in my life.</p>
<p>UFO 50 report: 26 of 50 games played. Made it past the halfway mark! Caramel Caramel is excellent but Porgy is the biggest challenge of the week. Pesky, pesky giant shark...</p>
<p>Game of the week is (yet again!) Star Wars Outlaws. Tatooine is far bigger than I was expecting with vast open desert areas, secret caves, Jawas and if I squint really, really hard I can pretend I’m on Arrakis. Looking forward to reaching the main end game story arch.</p>
