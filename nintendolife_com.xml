<p>Just a week after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">Ubisoft announced</a> it was making a huge amount of cuts and cancellations in order to aid efficiency and corporate restructuring, the French studio has confirmed it will be increasing the price of <strong>Just Dance+</strong> subscriptions from <strong>April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The streaming service, which launched back in November 2022, can be used in-game from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/just_dance_2023_edition">Just Dance 2023 Edition</a> onward, and gives you access to even more songs from the series' back-catalogue.</p>
<p>But that'll come at a steeper cost from, with monthly prices rising by <strong>$1</strong> a month, 3-month passes going up <strong>$3</strong>, and a year's pass costing an extra <strong>$5</strong>. Here's a rundown of the before and after:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Month Pass: $<strong>4.99</strong> <strong>/ 4,99€</strong> (previously $3.99 / 3,99€)</li>
<li>3 Month Pass: $<strong>12.99</strong> <strong>/ 12,99€</strong> (previously $9.99 / 9,99€)</li>
<li>12 Month Pass: $<strong>29.99</strong> <strong>/ 29,99€</strong> (previously $24.99 / 24,99€)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, new content is coming in the form of more songs, some of which are available from today, including 'Walking on Sunshine' by Katrina &amp; The Waves, 'Toxic' by Britney Spears, and 'Dynamite' by BTS. A second batch lands on 10th February 2026.</p>
<p>But the timing isn't great timing, especially in the aftermath <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">of last week's news</a>, which saw six games — including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/prince-of-persia-team-behind-cancelled-sands-of-time-remake-shares-final-message">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> — get cancelled, studios get closed down, and restructuring at various offices. All in aid of a live-service push, specialisations, and investments in generative AI.</p>
<p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/surprise-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated">Rayman 30th Anniversary rating has appeared</a> (which is potentially being handled by Atari), but it doesn't look rosy. According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">IGN</a>, the Paris headquarters are looking at a cost-reduction initiative, including a voluntary redundancy process, with French union Solidaires Informatique reportedly planning more action following a call to strike last week (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/anger-and-despair-reigning-supreme-at-ubisoft-following-restructuring-plan-says-union">GamesIndustry.biz</a>).</p>

<p>Batting up in March</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="55d0ce9c13177"><a title="Aaron Judge MLB The Show 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/55d0ce9c13177/aaron-judge-mlb-the-show-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the arrival of the Switch 2, we've finally been getting some parity across the multiplatform sports games across all consoles, with EA and 2K's offerings being much-better than their Switch 1 counterparts.</p>
<p>We thought we'd see the same from Sony's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_26">MLB The Show 26</a>, which has <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-reveal-aaron-judge/">been confirmed</a> for a <strong>17th March 2026</strong> release alongside the reveal of cover star Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees, who is returning to front for the second time.</p>
<p>But Sony Interactive Entertainment's next entry is opting to stay on the Switch 1 and isn't coming to the Switch 2 right now. Of course, it may be that developer San Diego Studio doesn't have access to Switch 2 dev kits, but it's a rather strange decision from the outside.</p>
<p>As usual, a gameplay reveal will follow next week on <strong>3rd February</strong>, where you'll likely get a small glimpse at Switch gameplay. We're not holding our breath for any improvements, so <em>maybe</em> a Switch 2 port is coming later in the year.</p>

<p>Besides that, pre-orders for the Standard and Digital Deluxe Editions — the latter of which will grant Early Access, allowing you to play the game from13th March (unlikely on Switch, of course) — open after the gameplay reveal on 3rd February at <strong>12 pm EST/ 9 am PST</strong> at certain retailers, digital storefronts, and on the game's <a href="http://theshow.com/">official website</a>.</p>
