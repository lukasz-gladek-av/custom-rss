<p>Improvements to vehicles, photo mode, and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0650ed79dac82/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure><p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">has released</a> yet another patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on Switch 2, introducing a number of fixes and improvements to vehicles, photo mode, quests, the open world, and more.</p>
<p>One of the key improvements is the implementation of AutoDrive, which would previously be a bit hit and miss – quite literally. It seems this has now been smoothed out, allowing vehicles to avoid obstacles a bit better and make navigation generally a bit more pleasant.</p>
<p>It's kind of remarkable to see the team at CDPR continue to apply improvements to Cyberpunk five years after its initial release. Yes, the game was a bit of a mess at launch, but it's since been moulded into what might be one of the best open world games of all time. Heck, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG9Hn3aT7jo">our lovely video producer Alex thinks so</a>, anyway!</p>
<p>So let's check out the full patch notes...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated AutoDrive. When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Johnny always spawned in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applying CrystalCoat to the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru caused its wheels to flash in different colors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Photo Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the new poses introduced in Update 2.3 now work with any gender.</li>
<li>Disabled NPC collision, which will make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision (e.g. on car hoods).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some of the poses didn't work for Royce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freedom</em> - Fixed the journal entry that appears when the player chooses not to steal the Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred."</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath</em> - Fixed an issue where, after V fails to pursue and stop Semimaru and receives a text from River saying he'll contact V soon, the follow-up message never arrives.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath -</em> Fixed an issue where the Yaiba Semimaru could flip over during the chase, preventing the player from entering it.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath -</em> It's no longer possible to trigger the quest if River died during <em>The Hunt</em>.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath</em> - Players can now acquire the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru through AUTOFIXER even if they failed <em>The Hunt</em>, which normally unlocks the side quest where the vehicle is obtained.</li>
<li><em>Nitro (Youth Energy)</em> - Fixed a game crash that could occur in certain circumstances after leaving the Yaiba showroom event.</li>
<li><em>Nitro (Youth Energy)</em> - Fixed an issue where the proxy interface UI in the Yaiba showroom is cut off when the "Larger HUD Elements" setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several localization and lipsync issues in various languages.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to disable vignette. It can be found in Settings → Graphics → Basic.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on PC and Mac where Ray-Traced Reflections might not display correctly when enabled under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with displaying text messages from Delamain.</li>
<li>Various fixes for fluff vendors.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The patch is out now, so hopefully you've got it downloaded already, but if not, simply boot up your Switch 2 and this should trigger the download automatically.</p>

<figure><a title="Review: Genki Dual Wield Joy-Con Charging Dock For Switch 2 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b2b8b2977436/review-genki-dual-wield-joy-con-charging-dock-for-switch-2-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Genki — which recently made headlines by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-and-accessory-maker-genki-reach-settlement-in-switch-2-lawsuit">settling a lawsuit with Nintendo</a> after it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">showcased 3D-printed mockups of the Switch 2 during CES 2025</a> — has supported the arrival of the new hybrid console with a selection of accessories and cases. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/joy-station">Dual Wield ($39.99)</a> follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo">Force Field 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Sleeper Case</a>, and offers a means of charging four Joy-Con 2 controllers at once.</p>
<p>This isn't a new or groundbreaking concept, of course; we saw similar controller charging docks during the original Switch's lifespan. These products certainly have their uses, especially if you have one Switch 2 console but multiple Joy-Con for local multiplayer sessions, but is this worth the $40 asking price?</p>

<p>The Dual Wield certainly ticks all of the boxes when it comes to basic functionality. It consists of the charging dock (which is powered by a USB-A to USB-C cable, included in the bundle) and a pair of 'Delta' Joy-Con controller grips. These can charge your Joy-Con in two ways: there's a USB-C port on the top and a charging port on the bottom, which magnetically interfaces with the dock.</p>
<p>When charging on the dock, you'll see a pair of red LEDs light up for each Joy-Con – these turn to green once each Joy-Con is at full capacity. To eject the Delta grip, you press the button in front.</p>
<p>So far, so good, right? Sadly, the Delta grips themselves leave a little to be desired. It's not that they're uncomfortable to use – in fact, I'd go as far as to say they offer decent ergonomics when it comes to long play sessions. The bigger issue is that there's a lot of 'flex' on each Joy-Con, and it's actually possible to pull them off the grip without too much effort.</p>

<p>While a good, hard yank will also dislodge the Joy-Con from the official grip, it's much easier with Genki's offering. Nintendo's grips also avoid the 'flex' issue by including built-in prongs, which are what your hands grip during play. With the Genki Delta grip, you're mostly holding onto the Joy-Con themselves rather than the grip, hence the worrying amount of movement.</p>
<p>I also don't like how hard it is to see the Joy-Con's LED lights through the dark, transparent casing of the Delta grip. The light is dim, and it's sometimes hard to make out if the Joy-Con are switched on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Genki Dual Wield isn't a total miss; the Delta grips are comfortable to use, and the dock itself looks attractive enough to integrate into most AV setups. My biggest gripe is how unstable the Joy-Con feel when they're attached to that Delta; Nintendo's official grip is far superior.</p>

<p>And an old foe returns in a timed in-game event</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="DxM gyro and live event" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4892c75f309f/dxm-gyro-and-live-event.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Marvellous</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> has been out in the wild for around about a week now and, if you checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">our 6/10 review</a> of the game, you'll know that gyro controls were missing from action at launch. Boo!</p>
<p>Now, producer Kenichiro Tsukuda, <a href="https://x.com/dxm_game/status/1965228970770596351">via the game's official social media account</a>, has dropped some details on an upcoming patch that will sort our gyro woes, alongside a bunch of other fixes. Here's the post, plus the accompanying text detailing the upcoming patch notes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Planned Bug Fixes<br>
- Fix Rebellion’s behavior in the Teos Omos Desert.<br>
- Fix a bug where a violation of the End User License Agreement was incorrectly displayed when a network error occurred.<br>
- Fix for character models failing to load during event scenes.<br>
- Fix for Supply Bases becoming inaccessible.<br>
- Fix a bug where battle music fails to stop playing.<br>
- Fix other minor bugs.</p>
<p>Planned Additions and Adjustments<br>
- Added option to enable gyro controls for Nintendo Switch™ 2 and PlayStation®5.<br>
- Added options to adjust strength of camera acceleration and inertia.<br>
- Changed camera sensitivity settings to be separately adjustable for vertical and horizontal axes.<br>
- Changed early-game quest “The Bout With Ash” to allow players to pick up weapons inside the arena.<br>
- Improved loading times during online play.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no date on when exactly this patch will drop, but we're excited to see gyro-aiming get sorted so quickly. The other standouts are reduced loading times and camera improvements, which could make for a less stodgy feel to proceedings as we all keep our big metal fingers crossed for more meaningful performance gains and upgrades down the road.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, while awaiting the patch, you can also brush up on your mech-fighting skills against an old foe, as one of the original game's toughest boss battles has returned as a timed event that's running from right now until September 15th.</p>
<p>Yep, if you're a long-time fan, you'll need no introduction to Zeruchroar, who is back and looking for a scrap (cheers for the heads-up, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/09/11/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-brings-back-old-boss-for-a-new-event/">Forbes</a>). Now this was quite a nasty battle back on the first game, so luckily, if you are intending to try it, know that there is at least a reward in the form of some new blueprints and a "glitched fusion upgrade" should you best the rotten beast. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Oh, and just head to your base in-game to get an alert to start the timed event.</p>
