<figure><a title="eShop Selects June 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3be05fd374dba/eshop-selects-june-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well well well — one month with the Switch 2, and we're <em>still</em> swimming in eShop games. Yep, it's time for eShop Selects for June 2025!</p>
<p>Who needs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> when you've got backwards compatibility, eh? Just because we have a new console, doesn't mean we're <em>just</em> looking at Switch 2 games. And going forward, eShop Selects will be looking at eShop games on both consoles.</p>
<p>So, let's run down the rules quickly; Game Key-Card and Code In Box releases won't be included here, only eShop exclusives (at least in the West). Where a digital-only game has a Switch 1 and Switch 2 version, we'll be focusing on the Switch 2 version. And we know some of these are and might get a limited physical down the line, but for now, they're digital only, so they do count.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jyiwsu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Okay. Other than that, things are basically the same — we ask our writers and contributors to pick their top three eShop games from June 2025 from what we reviewed, and the games with the highest total scores will make our top three. It's a strong month this time around, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:184784,184489 @ 1751881415 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Eleven games made the cut this time around, with the new console ushering in some new exclusives and upgraded titles. But most of these <em>are</em> Switch 1 games, of course. Hooray for being able to play old games on the new system!</p>
<p>A busy month, unsurprisingly, then! Note that No Man's Sky isn't here because it has a Switch 1 physical. Otherwise, here's what didn't quite make our top three, and as always, there's a ton of variety here.</p>

</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">3rd Place - Deltarune</a></h2>
<p>Even though we've got at least three chapters left, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> still absolutely rules.</p>
<p>All three of our podium finishers are Switch 2 launch titles, and Deltarune — along with the new chapters 3 and 4 — was maybe the most surprising. Deltarune may have started way back in 2018, but the two new chapters may well be the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is this writer's favourite, balancing brand new gameplay styles with hilarious characters and a shocking end. Chapter 5 comes in 2026, and we can't wait. We gave the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">first four chapters an 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">2nd Place - Fast Fusion</a></h2>
<p>Shin’en has done it again; Fast Fusion is a stand-out launch title, even alongside the beautiful Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>If you need a game to demonstrate the Switch 2's graphical capabilities (that isn't Cyberpunk), then Fast Fusion is it. It looks <em>stunning</em> both docked and handheld, and is the current hardcore racers' choice on the new console. Plus, you can play it with a friend on Switch 1 with GameShare.</p>
<p>While it's largely a refinement of what came before, with a few new mechanics sprinkled in, Fast Fusion is a must-buy for the Switch 2, and one of the cheapest games to pick up right now, too. We scored this one a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">well-deserved 9/10</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:183389,184310 @ 1751880302 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a></h2>
<p>Just weeks after launch on Switch 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> got a Switch 2 Edition, and — lo and behold — it's outstanding. Because we were still working on our review in May's eShop Selects, and the Switch 2 version was looming, we decided to hold the game back for June's edition. And, well, we may as well invent a new life for the game — Champion.</p>
<p>Level-5 has cemented its return with a huge time sink that's incredibly difficult to put down, once it has its hooks in you. While it may not have the narrative depth of the 3DS game, there is <em>so</em> much to do, and it never gets boring. You can decorate an entire island, journey through a huge open world, spend hours fishing and crafting, or attempt to level every single Life. It's a staggering achievement, and there's still more to come, including DLC.</p>
<p>We scored Fantasy Life i <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">a 9/10</a>, and it's our eShop Selects June 2025 winner!</p>

<p>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-june-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>Launching the same month as CrossWorlds</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega is promoting its upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> in all sorts of ways, and apart from the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/wait-busted-member-is-the-singer-of-sonic-racing-crossworlds-opening">opening theme reveal earlier this week</a>, it's also recently teased a new animation.</p>
<p>This new animation celebrating Sonic's latest racing game is scheduled to arrive this September (the same month as the game), and this initial preview was originally featured at Anime Expo. It shows Sonic and Shadow speeding along, but we don't get much else.</p>
<p>Sega released a two-part animated series for the previous game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/team_sonic_racing">Team Sonic Racing</a>. And more recently it released its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-episode-3-is-out-now">Dark Beginnings animation</a> to promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> (which is now also available on the Switch 2).</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will launch for the Switch on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>, with the Switch 2 version of this new game to arrive at a "later date", with a paid upgrade path also planned.</p>

<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64677a195d6b9/star-wars-rogue-squadron-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo Life</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello there, young Padawans, are you ready to continue your training in the art of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>?</p>
<p>Before we become one with the Force, let's look back to last week, where we saw a duel (of the fates) between two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_darkside_chronicles">Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a>. It was the European and Japanese cover that took the high ground in the end, snatching up 61% of the vote compared to North America's 39%. *<em>Insert falling LEGO Yoda sound effect here</em>*</p>
<p>This time, we're heading back to a galaxy far, far away — <em>yipee!</em> — as we match up two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</a>, on the N64. While perhaps not <em>quite</em> as beloved as its GameCube sequel, this high-octane flight combat game gave us all the Star Wars kick we so desperately craved in the late '90s, and <em>man,</em> did we pour the hours into it!</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>There are just the two covers to check out this time (no more, no less), so let's see which will become the Master, and which the Apprentice...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:123791 @ 1751880312 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79631c29329f4/star-wars-rogue-squadron-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, now there's a piece of art! The X-Wing takes centre stage, naturally, but the European and North American covers are all about the dogfighting. It's one of those where you spot more the longer you look. The TIE Fighter exploding in the background, the AT-ATs destroying Mos Eisley down below, all realised in a sweet painterly style. It's a good 'un, we've got to say.</p>
<p>Of course, the European variant was also home to the classic black border around the edge, but the art is identical, so we're not splitting them in two this time.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98f26850baff1/star-wars-rogue-squadron-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover is darker and more stripped back than the previous one we looked at, subbing the '<em>action everywhere!</em>' approach for a simple one-on-one between an X-Wing and a TIE Fighter. The attempt to go more realistic with the visuals means time hasn't been too kind to this one, but we appreciate the gloomy vibes it's going for. And hey, the ship 'blueprints' on the top and bottom of the box are cool.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-star-wars-rogue-squadron]]></content:encoded>
