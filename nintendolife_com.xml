<p>Wait, I know you</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, isn't this a surprise that <em>nobody could have seen coming</em>. Bethesda has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> is getting a free Switch 2 upgrade. What's more, it's available today!</p>
<p>Any Dragonborns playing on Switch 2 will get to experience the 2011 RPG at an enhanced resolution, with improved load times, performance optimisation, Mouse Mode support and more. Let's not forget that the Anniversary Edition packs in the game's three official expansions — Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire — Creations Club items, and those sweet Zelda crossover assets that we all enjoyed in the Switch 1 base game.</p>
<p>The above reveal trailer gives you a pretty good idea of what we can expect from the game on Switch 2 (<em>it's Skyrim</em>), but you can get an even better look by checking out the images below.</p>

<p>Those with the Switch 1 version of the Anniversary Edition can nab the Switch 2 upgrade for free. Otherwise, you can upgrade from the base game to the Anniversary Edition for £17.99 (or your regional equivalent) or buy the whole thing for £52.99.</p>
<p>We recently sat down with Bethesda Creative Director Matt Carofano to find out more about this new version - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-skyrim-dev-on-returning-for-a-switch-2-re-release">check out our interview</a>.</p>

<p>2026 with the genre mix</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Silver Lining Interactive has just announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/death_howl">Death Howl</a> — which is currently sat on a rather healthy <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/death-howl/">Metascore of 84</a> — will release for Switch on <strong>20th February 2026</strong> (it's out today on Xbox and PC). Oh, and there's a physical version and everything. Hooray!</p>
<p>The game itself has a very intriguing art style and set-up, which you can check out for yourself in the trailer up top, and gameplay is described as melding Soulslike combat with your usual deckbuilding strategy aspects. It's a lot of stuff we really like, in other words, all mixed together.</p>
<p>In Death Howl, you assume the role of Ro, a grieving mother who seeks to resurrect her dead son. So, keeping it all nice and light on the narrative front.</p>
<p>In order to do said resurrecting, Ro needs to "craft cards, harness shamanic totems, and face tormented spirits across mystical realms, blending tactical deck-building with intense grid-based combat."</p>
<p>Here's some further details from ye olde press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A journey to the spirit realm</strong><br>
In forgotten lands cloaked in myth, Ro, a hunter from a humble tribe, descends into the spirit world guided only by grief and distant whispers. Her path uncovers love, loss, and resilience as every step reveals hidden memories and long-buried truths.</p>
<p><strong>Master your deck-building skills</strong></p>
<p>Explore eerie regions, gather ingredients, and craft cards to expand your tactical options. Shamanic totems unlock powerful abilities, while melee and ranged spells allow you to balance offence and defence. Every card shapes your survival strategy against relentless enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Engage in grid-based combat</strong></p>
<p>Test your wits against unique enemy types and towering bosses in tense, grid-based encounters. Adapt your deck to carve a path through haunted lands like the <strong>Forest of Howling Shadows</strong> and the <strong>Meadows of Delusion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A mother’s grief, a spirit’s journey</strong></p>
<p>Beyond combat, <em>Death Howl</em> is a moving tale of grief, healing, and acceptance. Ro’s journey into the unknown is both harrowing and hopeful, weaving an atmospheric story where every victory carries the weight of love and loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the physical edition, pre-orders are now open over at <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/products/absolum-standard-edition-nintendo-switch-copy?_pos=1&amp;_sid=4c4b6d51e&amp;_ss=r">Silver Lining's official website</a> and priced at £29.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are). Given that the game has garnered so much positive feedback thus far, we'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it as that Switch release date draws near.</p>

<p>Claire Redfield was eventually added as a key connection</p>

<figure data-uuid="0871e01975892"><a title="Resident Evil 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0871e01975892/resident-evil-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hideki Kamiya, the famed game creator who made his directorial debut with the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a>, has been talking a lot about the survival horror series in recent days.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1998, Resident Evil 2 was a significant step up from the first game, though its production was troubled, to say the least. After completing around 60-80% of the initial build, development was restarted when script writer Noburu Sugimura was added to the team. Prior to this, in what is now known as Biohazard (Resident Evil) 1.5, the game had almost no connection to the original, and certainly no returning characters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="53peCvnRDq8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt53peCvnRDq8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938a0zkitnl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In responding to a fan's comment speculating on the inclusion of Rebecca Chambers in Resident Evil 2, Kamiya explained the reasoning behind the decision to go with completely new protagonists. He states that he "didn't consider the feelings of the users" at the time and wanted to provide his own vision for the sequel. When Sugimura joined, however, Kamiya was convinced to create Claire Redfield, whose brother, Chris, was one of the primary protagonists of the original.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At the time, I was a selfish idiot who didn't consider the feelings of the users, so when I was making Biohazard 2, I decided to remove all the characters from the previous game and start a new one.</p>
<p>"In the end, this was buried in the dark as Biohazard 1.5, and when Sugimura-sensei joined the team later, he got mad at me, saying, "Why aren't you including the characters from the previous game?", so I added Chris's sister, Claire..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Biohazard 1.5 is not available in any official capacity, fans have been diligently working on creating a playable version, with various builds available since around 2013. Capcom itself officially recognised 1.5 in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a> remake, adding in a special costume for Claire based on concept art for the scrapped protagonist Elza Walker.</p>
<p>Fans of the series on Switch 2 can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, all of which will release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>The 'Dig to the Beat' event gets underway on <strong>16th December</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>23rd December</strong>, so you have plenty of time to rack up an Emerald Rush high score and pick up the reward statues.</p>
<p>And what rewards they are! Hot off the back of Lanky and Chunky Kong's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/donkey-kong-bananzas-next-dlc-in-game-event-swings-into-action-next-week">statue appearances last month</a>, the upcoming event features Jungle Beat's Ghastly and Ninja Kong, immortalised as unlockable island accessories.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4khqnxs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>For reference, here is the exact time that the 'Dig to the Beat' event will kick off in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 12am PST / 1am MST / 2am CST / 3am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As was the case with the two debut events, this one will challenge you to complete Emerald Rush runs with a limited, pre-determined set of perks available, so prepare to switch up your gem-collecting tactics on the fly.</p>
<p>This will likely be the final in-game event of the year, but we expect to see more swing over to the DLC package in 2026.</p>
