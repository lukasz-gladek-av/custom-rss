<p>The Gran is always bluer on the other side</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Cygames has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/granblue-fantasy-relink-endless-ragnarok">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a> is making its way to Switch 2 in a new 'Endless Ragnarok' package.</p>
<p>Set to come out way on <strong>9th July</strong>, this is the same Relink experience that so many know and love from back in 2024, with a couple of new bells and whistles to mark the Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>Chief among the additions is a playable Eustace and Beatrix, who join the 20-character roster with their unique fighting styles — Beatrix up close and personal with her swords, and Eustace from further afield with his guns.</p>
<p>Both local and online co-op are enabled, too, so you'll be able to team up with pals and take on enemies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on an epic journey in the Sky Realm. In this visually stunning action RPG, players will journey alongside a diverse cast of allies, exploring breathtaking floating islands and battling powerful foes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> had a great time with Relink when it launched on PS5 back in 2024, stating, "whether you're playing alone or in co-op, there's a real thrill to Relink's combat system, which combines precise hacking and slashing with underlying RPG stats and mechanics," in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/granblue-fantasy-relink">8/10 review</a>. Let's hope things look just as bright on Switch 2, eh?</p>

<p>They look... okay?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem has received a new trailer as part of Nintendo's Partner Direct showcase, and while most of the gameplay has already been revealed elsewhere, we got our first proper look at the game's amiibo figures. As an aside, it was really funny to see just how careful Capcom has been to avoid showing any blood in the trailer – no way would Leon be so inaccurate with his gun!</p>
<p>In addition to Grace Ashcroft, an amiibo for Leon has also been revealed, with both unlocking cosmetic skins for your in-game weapons. Only one was showcased here: a neon skin for the Requiem handgun for Leon. It looks wild and wacky, and perhaps not the kind of thing you want to see in a horror title in your first playthrough.</p>
<p>For subsequent playthroughs though? Yeah, we'll be activating all sorts of different costumes and skins - can't wait.</p>
<p>The amiibo don't have a firm release date yet, but we can expect to see them at some point in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>. Unfortunately, by then, we suspect most will have completed the game already. Maybe multiple times!</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem will launch for the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Skål!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a port that we weren't expecting! Coffee Stain Studios has announced that the popular Viking survival game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/valheim">Valheim</a> will be coming to Switch 2 in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Having launched into Early Access back in 2021 before expanding to other platforms two years later, Valheim might feel like a bit of a known quantity at this point. But hey, it's always good to get in on the fun, and we can imagine this being a good fit for Switch 2.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Valheim is an exploration and survival game, set in a wonderful world of Norse mythology. You'll go full Viking, taming the wilderness as you explore the lands and build a civilisation along the way — combat, smithing, hunting, crafting, you know the open world drill.</p>
<p>Much like on PC, this version will let you play either solo or with up to nine pals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s time to set sail on your very own Viking adventure! Discover the monster-infested world of Valheim on your own or with up to nine friends as you fight and craft your way to greatness. Survive, and you’ll prove yourself to Odin and earn a place in his halls. Skål!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now sure, things look rather blurry in the Switch footage above, but let's hope that it's all a little cleaner when it eventually arrives later this year.</p>
