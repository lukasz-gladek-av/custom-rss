<p>Kirby has proven his absolute dominance in the region once again, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> getting off the start line in style with a sweet 195,594 sales under its belt. It's nothing compared to the 380,000 debut that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">The Forgotten Land</a> mustered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/03/japanese-charts-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-absorbs-more-big-sales">back in 2022</a>, but for a game as niche as Air Riders, it ain't bad going!</p>
<p>Elsewhere, last week's chart-topper in Konami's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/momotaro-dentetsu-2-anata-no-machi-mo-kitto-aru-higashi-nihon-hen-plus-nishi-nihon-hen-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Momotaro Dentetsu</a> board game sequel has tumbled down to fourth and sixth on Switch and Switch 2 respectively, leaving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> to fill out the remaining spots on the podium. Oh yes, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> pushed past the big 100,000 sales.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adoqkzmn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Switch 2 hardware sales have seen an expected boost by the presence of a new exclusive Kirby in town, with the console finding itself comfortably at the top of the hardware chart with an additional 126,953 units to its name. It has also been a strong week for PS5 sales, mind you, with the Digital Edition achieving 23,381, and the Pro even overtaking the Switch Lite and standard models with 11,367.</p>
<p>All this means that combining the console SKUs swings things in Sony's favour this time, with the three PS5 units clocking in at 36,920, while the Switch 1 models combine for 29,370.</p>

<p>The Final Masterpiece</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a welcome surprise! Hot off the back of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Bloober Team has shared with us the <em>next</em> project that it's working on for Switch 2, and it's none other than an all-new <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> package.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a> will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>19th December</strong>, bundling together <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, every DLC expansion, and brand-new chapters into one spooky edition fully optimised for the new system.</p>
<p>There are the added bonuses of HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, too, <em>and</em> you have the option to play with motion controls or touchscreen inputs if you see fit. Here's the official blurb from Bloober Team and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Layers of Fear</em> is a first-person experience that blends story-driven exploration, environmental puzzles, and psychological horror. The Final Master Edition brings together the intertwined stories of three characters — the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer — each consumed by their devotion to art. The atmosphere is elevated by a chilling yet hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by award-winning musician Arek Reikowski. Rebuilt with HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, this edition deepens immersion in its melancholic and spine-chilling world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all sounds like a pretty strong way to experience these psychological horror titles. The full Final Masterpiece Edition will be available on the eShop for <strong>$39.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) next month — because the holiday season <em>really</em> needs some more scares, right?</p>
<p>For those curious, we had a perfectly good time with Cronos: The New Dawn when it arrived on Switch 2 back in September, describing it as "a celebration of survival horror, paying homage to all the genre greats effectively, although failing to do anything truly original" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">our review</a>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>What's your favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Timesplitters</a> game?</p>
<p>Did you say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_2">TimeSplitters 2</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Future Perfect</a>? Or even the first one, aptly named "<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/timesplitters">Timesplitters</a>"? Good, we're gonna get along just fine!</p>
<p>Now, whilst we're not here to announce a new version of Timesplitters 1, 2, or 3 for Switch consoles or anything amazing like <em>that</em>, almost as excitingly, a fan-made re-imagining composed of a campaign mash-up of all three games alongside a huge multiplayer suite of multiplayer challenge maps and modes, has finally — after 13 long years — <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">been released to the public on PC</a>. And it's going down well with anyone in the know.</p>

<p>We've been following the progress of this one for a long while now on and off, and it's absolutely been a real labour of love for its creators, Cinder Interactive, having worked on this project in some form or another since way back when Crytek gave them their full IP blessing off the back of a Timesplitters mod for <strong>Unreal Tournament 2004</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, that transports us back, kids. In fact, you should really check out the <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/about">extensive Project History over at the game's official site</a> to take in the full and fascinating story behind the twists and turns in bringing this new game to life.</p>
<p>So, it's a bit of a surprise, and certainly something worth highlighting, that after a number of setbacks and just how long it's taken, Timesplitters: Rewind has finally released. It's actually real! Furthermore, and if you've checked out the trailer above, we're sure you'll agree, it looks absolutely STONKING. And it's free.</p>
<p>Ah. Timesplitters. Just when we thought we were out (to be fair, we've been out for a couple of decades) you've gone and dragged us right back in. Now, where's our GameCube controllers?</p>
