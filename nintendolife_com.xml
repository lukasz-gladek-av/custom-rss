<p>Reggie has even shared an official comment about Pokémon's success over the years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Pokémon Company is without peer, responsible for creating a massive juggernaut of a franchise that has become a landmark title in gaming’s storied history. I saw firsthand the love and care that went into each Pokémon game I was part of, and how much each new game resonated deeply with the fans. Now, to be there for Pokémon, when it’s being recognized as this year’s winner of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award, it’s a full circle moment that I am ecstatic to be a part of!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in the same PR, Pokémon originally broke through in the "mid-to-late 90s", and most recently achieved "$12 billion global retail sales in 2024, including over 489 million game copies sold since 1996".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pokémon is considered one of the world’s highest-grossing media franchises. Its legend only grows stronger as new generations are drawn to new video games, animated series, movies, The Pokémon Trading Card game, mobile apps and more from The Pokémon Company."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2026 New York Game Awards will take place on <strong>18th January 2026</strong> at the SVA Theatre in Manhattan. Tickets for this are <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/15th-ny-game-awards-gg-fest-supergiant-concert-tickets-1743597620419?aff=oddtdtcreator">now available to purchase online</a>. This award follows the recent release of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> on the Switch and Switch 2 in October.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo yesterday <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">launched a new search page</a>, allowing users to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Switch 2. This includes the ability to look up individual games and apps, instead of having to wait for Nintendo to update entire pages and official documents.</p>
<p>It's got us wondering how you're finding Switch compatibility on the new hybrid device now that we're six months into the system's life. Admittedly, there are still some issues - with games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR: Automata</a> and video apps like YouTube still not supported. Of course, we're also getting regular updates as Nintendo rolls out new firmware for the Switch 2.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ntijmv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>So, how are you finding Switch compatibility on the Switch 2? Is your favourite game or app supported yet?

And most of all, has the Switch game compatibility feature lived up to your expectations?</p>

<p>A YouTube premiere has already been set up, and you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6ePBMZWeCo">watch it right here</a>.</p>

<p>We've had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1mTbYB6EOM">one brief teaser</a> of the movie during September's Nintendo Direct, which confirmed the film's official title. But other than that, we know little else other than it will be arriving in cinemas on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, earlier today, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a certain character design</a> may have leaked for a second time.
