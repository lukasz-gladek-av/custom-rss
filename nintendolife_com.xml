<figure data-uuid="046aaf27c8ac8"><a title="Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/046aaf27c8ac8/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, the day is finally upon us. Today is the last day that you can buy Switch Game Vouchers before Nintendo consigns them to the 'Discontinued' pile.</p>
<p>The Big N initially made the announcement way back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">July 2025</a>, but time has flown by since then, so we thought it was only right to give you one last nudge now that the day of reckoning is upon us.</p>
<p>You have until <strong>11:59pm</strong> in your timezone to make any final purchases, and the vouchers will be valid for one year from the point you buy them — so any that you pick up today won't expire until 30th January 2027. As ever, you'll need an active Nintendo Switch Online membership to get the vouchers in the first place.</p>
<p>For those who have missed out on this offer until today, Switch Game Vouchers come in pairs and can be used on select first-party digital purchases — saving you a few quid in the process. A pair of vouchers costs £84 / $99.98, which, when used on two full-price Switch 1 releases, knocks £16 / $20 off the combined price. It's a pretty sweet deal, we must admit.</p>
<p>While Game Vouchers cannot be used on Switch 2 exclusives, Nintendo has confirmed that it will continue to add Switch 1 releases to the scheme throughout 2026. Just yesterday, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> is a part of the Voucher programme and new releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> are available in it too (both of which have a paid upgrade option to Switch 2, if you choose to do that down the line).</p>
<p>You can find the full list of eligible games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0" rel="noopener">Nintendo's website</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make the most of this offer before it's gone, either head over to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo website</a> and sign in with your active NSO account, or head to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' section of the eShop on your Switch / Switch 2 and select 'Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers'. Do keep in mind that you can't have more than eight active Vouchers on your account at once, so don't go crazy out there!</p>
<p>So long, partner!</p>

<p>One aspect of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> we thought was "excellent" was the music. With this in mind, it's been announced the game's soundtrack will be getting a physical release in Japan on <strong>17th April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It will include five CDs and a total of <strong>148 tracks</strong>. The good news is this also extends to the game's DLC expansion <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, which launched at the end of last year. Along with this, it comes with a full-colour 36-page booklet, and as a purchase bonus, there's a wire key ring featuring three acrylic charms.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7nkmuhj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"This is a complete version of 148 songs, including background music found in "Pokémon LEGENDS ZA" and "Pokémon LEGENDS ZA M-Dimension Rush," as well as past songs used in the games!"</p>

<p>There's no mention of a local release at this stage, but if we hear any updates (or pre-orders are made available elsewhere for local trainers), we'll share an update.</p>

<p>If you haven't already played Z-A or the Mega Dimension DLC, be sure to check out our reviews here on Nintendo Life.

<p>Following a response from AdHoc Studio</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="af43581ad9511"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af43581ad9511/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The superhero comedy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dispatch">Dispatch</a> is out on the Switch and Switch 2 this week and as we've already highlighted in our review, the 'Visual Censorship' toggle has been removed from the Nintendo versions of the game, meaning censorship is automatically activated with no option to change it.</p>
<p>We reached out to the developer AdHoc Studio <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">earlier this week</a> to ask what was up, and received the following response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AdHoc Studio:</strong> <em>"Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. For our Switch release, we worked with Nintendo to adapt certain elements so Dispatch could be on their platform."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo has got an official statement</a> about "Dispatch's censorship" after contacting Nintendo. Here's what it had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated by Nintendo here, games on its platforms must be rated and meet its established guidelines. And while it informs its partners when titles don't meet its guidelines, it "does not make changes to partner content" and also won't discuss the content or criteria used to make determinations.</p>
<p>If there are any other notable developments, statements, or sudden changes, we'll provide an update, but for now, these are the official responses each party has provided. Unsurprisingly, this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">hasn't stopped fans</a> <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/eurogamer-dispatch-on-switch-1-2-is-permanently-censored-possibly-mandated-by-nintendo.1418761/page-18#post-150688015">and gaming communities from speculating</a> about what else might be going on here. Some outlets have also shared theories that factor in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-and-this-might-be-the-reason/">local ratings boards</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the removal of these "visual censorship" settings, Dispatch on the Switch and Switch 2 still had us hooked until the bitter end with the potential of its ever-changing arcs. You can find out more about the game in our full review, and read more about the removal of the toggle in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">our previous story</a>.</p>
