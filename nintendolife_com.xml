<p>Makes a change from climbing up and down trees</p>

<figure><a title="Miyamoto dk Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53e3e436b4539/miyamoto-dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cast your minds back to the year of our lord 2017, and you may remember we reported on how a certain Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto liked to play a pre-release version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/03/shigeru_miyamoto_spent_a_lot_of_time_climbing_trees_in_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">climbing up and down trees repeatedly for treats</a> that the devs would leave for him. No, this isn't a wind-up, and he can do what he wants. He created the series. Jeez.</p>
<p>Now, as revealed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/top-bananza-donkey-kongs-long-awaited-return-is-a-literal-smash-hit">The Guardian</a>'s interview with Bananza's producer, Kenta Motokura, (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/nintendo-icon-shigeru-miyamoto-spent-his-time-testing-donkey-kong-bananza-smashing-and-digging-in-one-spot-which-tracks-following-his-hour-long-breath-of-the-wild-playtesting-stint-just-climbing-trees/">GamesRadar</a>), it seems "Shiggy" has an equally unique and stylish way of playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which involved simply smashing and digging instead of doing anything that would further the campaign along whilst playing a pre-release version of the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4onqyph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Motokura let slip (thanks) that whilst the team had the legendary creator check the unfinished adventure occasionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Instead of progressing through the game, he just stuck to one point, smashing and digging around a lot. It was a good thing to see him playing that way … it proved that there are a lot of things that players could potentially be curious about in the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. We're gonna be honest, this is how we play, too. Not quite sure what the issue is.</p>
<p>Of course, by having the man transfixed like this on one spot, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> team was able to ascertain that they <em>were</em> onto something good with the basic mechanics at the very least, which, with something as freeform as Bananza and all the voxel-based destruction presented therein, could be a challenge to keep track of.</p>
<p>As Kazuya Takahashi, the game's director, explained in the same interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For this sort of game, where you can destroy anything, there was no precedent...So in that sense, we did struggle with various things. Developing the levels was quite challenging. For each stage, we wanted to make sure that the level would be fun even without that destruction element.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when he's just messing around, it seems, Miyamoto can't help but be useful.</p>

<figure><a title="WaterField Designs CitySlicker - front" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b014b30eaf852/waterfield-designs-cityslicker-front.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sasha Stowe</em></figcaption></figure><p>The WaterField Designs CitySlicker is a design that has been around for at least 10 years, and it has barely aged a day. From its full-grain leather front flap to its pleasingly voluminous rear mesh pouch, it’s a case that oozes quality and style, which is just as well given the $129 price tag.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is not a cheap case, we should nip that in the bud right away. But it’s unfair to judge a case on that alone, and when you consider that this is a product that has been handmade in San Francisco with seriously high-quality materials, you’ll realise that although the price is steep, you <em>absolutely</em> get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Its slim profile means it’ll slip into practically any bag that would’ve fit the console in the first place, and the internal padding not only keeps the console in place, but also provides some handy little bonus pockets should you wish to use them, although I wouldn’t recommend putting anything bulky or awkwardly shaped in them, as you could put undue pressure on your console.</p>

<p>What’s more, the padding for the screen is a red microfibre pad, meaning every time you put your console in or take it out, the screen is getting a little polish to take off the worst of your grubby fingerprints. Now <em>that’s</em> service!</p>
<p>You’ve also got five little leather pockets to store some game cards at the front, and although they’re a little stiff at first, the nature of the material means that the more you use them, the easier they’ll be to use. The magnetic clasps on the flap mean everything you put in absolutely will be staying in its place, and that peace of mind is worth its weight in precious materials.</p>
<p>We do have one minor gripe, however, and that’s the rigidity of the case. When your console isn’t inside, it’s surprisingly bendy, and doesn’t offer much in the way of support for itself, no doubt due to the extended length of the case and our old friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">the square-cube law</a>. We’re sure it’s not going to cause any issues, but it’s something to consider should you wish to pick one of these up.</p>
<p>And honestly, if you have the cash, you should. That, or perhaps their magnetic version if simplicity is more your bag (read: case).</p>



<p><em>Waterfield's CitySlicker for Switch 2 is priced at $129 and produced in batches that <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/nintendo-switch-cityslicker-case">you can pre-order from their website</a>. The sample used in this review was provided by the manufacturer.</em></p>
