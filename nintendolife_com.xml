<p>It's been a pretty quiet week, understandably, but Nintendo managed to squeeze in a cheeky update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2, so make sure to download that. Nintendo also hit us with yet another banging eShop sale in the US, so we collated all of the games that we think you should check out in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/137-switch-1-and-2-games-you-should-check-out-in-the-hits-for-the-holidays-nintendo-eshop-sale-us">one handy guide</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, we'd like to once again acknowledge the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/vince-zampella-call-of-duty-co-creator-and-respawn-head-has-died">passing of Vince Zampella</a> at the age of 55. As the co-creator of <strong>Call of Duty</strong>, he was undeniably a huge talent in the games industry, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still nursing a Linda McCartney-induced food coma after a week of glad tidings, so whatever I play this weekend, it’ll have to be something that keeps me very much curled up in my seat. There are another few areas of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> to see and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a> is calling my name. Mmm, cosy.</p>
<p>Have a good one, everybody!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Pushing into the final chapters of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> with the reminder that I will still have to tackle Goro Majima’s saga before I can consider this one cleared. Spending my final days of 2025 with Digital Eclipse’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> for a slice of nostalgia and knowledge and online co-op campaigns with my mates on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Still tackling ace pilot difficulty campaign on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> (one missile hit and game over), wondering with every mission failure, 'Why am I doing this to myself?' Is my ego writing checks my body can’t cash?</p>
<p>2025 was THE year of gaming for yours truly. I am quite looking forward to seeing what 2026 throws my way, but I am dreading the price of a hypothetical gaming PC upgrade… at least Switch 2 seems to continue to climb the industry ladder, can’t wait to see what new surprises Nintendo throws our way. Have a great New Year, everyone!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I don't think I'll be getting any games for Christmas, but I have bought my partner the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a>, in the hopes that he'll want to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a> (which he's mentioned before!). I've never played a Final Fantasy game except half of the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7</a>, which feels like it doesn't really count in a lot of ways. I hear FF6 is good! Don't tell me anything about it, though — I've somehow managed to avoid any FF spoilers for my entire life, and I'd like to keep it that way!</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to play through some of my Steam Deck backlog over the break, which includes a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/regency_solitaire">Regency Solitaire</a> that my friend got me, and <strong>Séance of Blake Manor</strong>. I'm looking forward to both.</p>
<p>Aaaand, if there's any time between all that, I'm going to try to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, and force my partner to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000XResist</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/13_sentinels_aegis_rim">13 Sentinels</a>. I think that's a reasonable amount of video games to fit into 2 weeks, right? Yeah. Totally reasonable.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> a couple of days ago and immediately hit Bandcamp to download the Blood Cultures soundtrack. And then immediately went back to Bandcamp, slightly grumpier, to download another Blood Cultures album that has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiA41zgrj_Y">the first song you hear in the game</a>. I've only played 20 minutes but I'm loving it so far.<br>
I really need to download <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2D</a> over Christmas, too - I am the ultimate target audience for that thing and I want to savour it. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is an end-of-year arrival (one that Felix put on his top five games of the gear, no less!) that I'm eager to sit down with.</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My wife and I have a bit of a tradition when it comes to the time after Christmas but before New Year: we hibernate. We'll pick a game, usually something fairly meaty like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>, and just go to town on it for a few days straight.</p>
<p>We'll break for dinner (plenty of leftovers), go for walks in the woods, and other stuff besides, but there could well be a 24-hour period where we do not leave the house or do anything of note beyond playing our chosen game. What'll it be this year? Let's just say that we've fallen dramatically behind on our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> recently.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't plan on playing much over the last remaining days of 2025, but I have recently started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a> again, so I'd like to dip into that one occasionally if I can find the time. It's a weirdly relaxing game despite some of the deviously tricky stages, y'know?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I think we'll be welcoming the New Year in with a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which I made the mistake of leaving Zach alone with for one morning and now we have all of the Battle-Tested and Forbidden Weapons, and have had them since level 50. So yeah, any sense of challenge in the main game has evaporated! What can you do about RPG fans, hey?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll be checking out the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> update and playing a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>. Nothing crazy, it's the holiday season, and we have a big 2026 ahead of us. See you next year!</p>

<p>Fans of the long-running RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> have a chance to tell Square Enix their thoughts about the series in a new online survey. It’s available until 9th January 2026 and features over 30 questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no reward at the end of it, so if you do plan on doing this survey, it's mostly to tell Square Enix how you feel. Of course, it will also narrow down who you are with the usual questions like your age and how many games you've purchased recently.</p>
<p>From there, you're asked things like whether you've bought physical or digital copies of Final Fantasy, your familiarity with the series, how many games in the series you've purchased, what game you like the most, and even how high your expectations are for the series "in the future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="KK3nTYgZ9yY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKK3nTYgZ9yY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6205b9lwqruz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Towards the end of the survey, you're also able to provide feedback about the Final Fantasy series with a written response.</p>

<p>This follows on from the recent release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo. If you haven’t already played this, It comes with a gifted bonus for the full game. This includes some “Revival Earrings” and the “Survival Set”. Your save data will also carry over to the main game when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> fan and happen to be located in the United States or Canada, Nintendo is currently running a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> ‘Legacy Sweepstakes’ featuring a “bounty” of prizes.</p>
<p>You can enter this sweepstakes via the My Nintendo website for <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong>. This gives you a chance to win the official Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective art book as well as a highly-detailed Samus Gravity Suit PVC statue from First 4 Figures.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit about both, along with a look:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f45e29e93c4d0"><a title="Metroid Prime" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f45e29e93c4d0/metroid-prime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, this art book showcases concept drawings, sketches, and assorted illustrations from the Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, and Metroid Prime Remastered games. With an extensive range of behind-the-scenes, high-quality artwork, this hardcover anthology spans more than 20 years of game development and includes exclusive commentary from Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe and Retro Studios. Printed on premium sheet-fed art paper, this book is stitch-bound, with a lavish cloth hardcover featuring an etched Samus metallic foil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First 4 Figures proudly presents a PVC statue of Samus Aran in her Gravity Suit inspired by the Metroid Prime game! Standing 10 inches tall and 7.9 inches wide, this deluxe statue faithfully recreates the sleek design and iconic components of the Gravity Suit. The base upon which Samus stands is inspired by the Screw Attack emblem. Plus, the Exclusive Edition incorporates an LED light-up function that brings Samus to life. When activated, key elements of the suit glow, including the helmet, Arm Cannon, and blue piping along the arms and legs!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official art book is valued at $49.99 USD and the statue is valued at $164.99 USD. This sweepstakes ends on <strong>3rd February 2026</strong>, and there will be five winners in total that receive both items.

This includes the talented Japanese developer Monolith Soft, best-known during the Switch generation for its work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series.</p>
<p>Now that another year has passed, the company has taken a brief moment on social media to acknowledge the release of the two titles it worked on this year. This obviously includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Here's the translated message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’ll also be plenty of hard work next year on even more projects! Here’s the translated message in full:</p>
<p>“Monolith Soft's last day of work for the year is today.</p>
<p>This year saw the release of two titles: “Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition” and “Mario Kart World,” on which we worked as a subcontractor.</p>
<p>All our staff will continue to work hard next year as well. We look forward to your continued support.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition arrived earlier this year in March. Since then, this version has received some compatibility updates for the Switch 2. As for the new Mario Kart, as we previously highlighted, Monolith Soft was contracted to develop "fields and character designs".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer celebrated the 8th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> with some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/anniversary-monolith-soft-celebrates-xenoblade-chronicles-2-with-a-post-but-were-desperate-for-a-switch-2-revamp">stunning artwork</a>. It also recently released an interview celebrating its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/monolith-soft-releases-interview-celebrating-its-work-on-the-zelda-series">work on the Zelda series</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5a355c79d7a30"><a title="Nintendo Hints That Metroid Prime 4's Tortured Development &quot;Divorced&quot; It From The Evolution Of The FPS Genre 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5a355c79d7a30/nintendo-hints-that-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-divorced-it-from-the-evolution-of-the-fps-genre-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">read our review</a>, we adored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and consider it to be one of the highlights of the Switch 2's library.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">with a Metacritic rating of 79 at the time of writing</a>, it's clear that Samus' latest adventure didn't strike the same chord with many players.</p>
<p>It's certainly a different experience from prior Metroid outings, and it seems that Nintendo is willing to chalk this down to its protracted development period – lest we forget, it was originally announced in 2017 with Bandai Namco assisting, but was rebooted in 2019 with Retro Studios returning to the helm.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/" rel="noopener">Famitsu</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson (a name isn't given, it's worth noting) gives the following assessment of Metroid Prime 4's development period (thanks to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-discusses-its-approach-to-metroid-prime-4-and-why-it-isnt-open-world/">Nintendo Everything</a> for the translation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world Metroid’. However, Metroid’s core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas. Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.</p>
<p>In the end, the game took much longer than expected to finish, and we realized that players’ impressions toward open-world games had changed. That being said, development had already been reset once before (when we started again from scratch with Retro Studios) so backtracking development again was out of the question, and we resolved to move forward with our original vision. During this time, shooting games and action games went through evolutions, with an increase in game speed in particular, but taking in those changes would have made it difficult to construct the tempo of an adventure game, so we actively chose to not take them into account. Therefore, I think this game is pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as we (and many other outlets) loved Metroid Prime 4, it's fair to say that Retro Studios wouldn't have chosen to inherit a design template it had little influence or control over, and this surprisingly candid interview appears to back up this assumption.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition</link>
            <guid>1392649</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Switch owners already have access to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear: Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">its sequel</a>, but Bloober Team is back with a new port for Switch 2. Utilising Unreal Engine 5 to achieve some truly impressive visuals, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a> is neither a sequel nor a remake, but rather the definitive vision of the series so far, packaging both titles into one enhanced experience.</p>
<p>The result is mixed. Although this is new for Switch 2, it launched elsewhere in 2023, before the studio significantly upped its game (in my opinion) with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>. As such, what you’re getting here is a perfect representation of what I’d call ‘old’ Bloober; one that focuses on scripted, linear events with minimal player agency.</p>
<p>There’s certainly a place for that, but Layers of Fear feels like the video game equivalent of a haunted house ride. Lots of things happen <em>around</em> you and it’s all very pretty, but rarely does anything actually happen <em>to</em> you. The result is a sense of detachment from the frequent scares, which come so thick and fast that there’s barely any time to soak in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>You've got three main stories here: The Painter from the original game, The Actor from its sequel, and The Writer, a new frame narrative that ties everything together. DLCs old and new can be accessed through The Writer’s story, making this a comprehensive retelling of the series. Each story features some wonderful voice acting, though I do think this has actually been overused. Nearly every note found in the environment (and there are a <em>lot</em>) features an unseen narrator, and it’s just a little excessive – thankfully, muting it entirely is an option.</p>
<p>Gameplay is a case of meandering through detailed environments to pick up documents, letters, and objects that gradually shed light on the overarching narrative. Mysterious sounds puncture the air, furniture moves of its own accord, and corridors that might seem perfectly normal at first glance shift in new directions when you give them a second look. This is pretty cool for the first couple of hours, but the novelty wears off.</p>
<p>Exacerbating this, navigating the world is a little tougher than it needs to be. You open doors by holding ‘ZR’ then pulling forward or back on the right stick. This works fine 90% of the time, but there are moments when it just won’t function as intended, so you’ll need to let go entirely and take a moment to recalibrate what your fingers and thumbs are actually doing. Optional mouse controls alleviate this slightly and feel great for the most part.</p>
<p>And what a handsome game! The lighting is particularly impressive, and it runs well on Switch 2, appearing to aim for 60fps when docked, though the 30fps and excessive motion blur can look a touch jarring in handheld. If you’ve yet to experience the 2016 original or its direct sequel, this is the best way to do so, but if you’re after a really solid horror experience, Cronos is the better option.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition]]></content:encoded>
