<figure><a title="Atlier reserlianana nananam famitsu score" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0168e87dbb5e/atlier-reserlianana-nananam-famitsu-score.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gust Corporation</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Famitsu scores have hit the inter tubes (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/famitsu-review-scores-issue-1915">Gematsu</a>) and in amongst all the excitement, we've got our very first score for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>The popular Japanese gaming magazine has awarded Gust's latest 8/8/8/8 [32/40], which ain't too bad at all considering that this writer's pick of the franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_ryza_3_alchemist_of_the_end_and_the_secret_key">Atelier Ryza 3</a>, got itself a 34 from the same weekly mag, and it was a cracker (as we go into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/atelier-ryza-3-alchemist-of-the-end-and-the-secret-key">lots more detail on in our 9/10 review</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-and-the-white-guardian-devs-on-the-series-evolution-ai-and-de-stressing-with-dk">We recently spoke with the folks behind Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> about the game, AI, and a bunch of other things, and we'll be bringing you our own thoughts on the latest Atelier adventure a little down the line.</p>
<p>In the same issue, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_robot_wars_y">Super Robot Wars Y</a> (which released in the West at the end of August), Bandai Namco's grid-based combat RPG, also got itself a score of 8/8/9/8 [33/40] on Switch.</p>

<figure><a title="madden big patch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c10fce3ee4b2e/madden-big-patch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>EA Sports has dropped a huge new update for the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a>. The September 17th patch introduces a large number of fixes, adjustments, and other bits and bobs to a game that does a very solid job of bringing the full Madden experience to handheld - so long as you can take the frame rate hit.</p>
<p>Focusing in on highlights here, this patch (which brings the game to version 1.7) brings defensive adjustments in the midfield that should make runners a little easier to catch, whilst a new mechanic that's been brought over from EA's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_26">College Football</a> franchise allows you to make your own default pass protection system to suit your chosen coach philosophy. Audio and visual effects, some quirky animations and other bugs also see fixes.</p>
<p>You can check out the full, and very long, patch notes over at <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-september-17-2025">EA's site</a>, but here are some highlights for your perusal:</p>

<li>Resolved desyncs in 6v6 and Sick Six modes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Audio</h2>
<ul>

</ul>

<hr>
<p>Indeed, a glance over to the game's forums in the wake of the news of this update, and players seem very happy with the laundry list of changes in the patch notes, most of which have been in response to feedback. So well played there, EA.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">8/10 review</a>, we said Madden NFL 26 is "a very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory. Yes, you'll need to get used to a drop in the frame rate to 40fps on Switch 2, but it's a reasonable downgrade in order to get this type of game running as well as it does on a portable machine."</p>
