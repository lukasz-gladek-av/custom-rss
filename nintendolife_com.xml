<p>Star Wars Outlaws releases on Switch 2 this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/343efa136838a/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot mentioned recently how he was hopeful the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> could <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/ubisofts-yves-guillemot-is-hopeful-that-upcoming-switch-2-port-can-revive-star-wars-outlaws">potentially revive the game</a>. While there's always a chance, beyond this adventure, the future doesn't sound very promising for Kay Vess and Nix.</p>
<p>According to a new scoop by Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, a sequel to Outlaws was originally planned but was recently scrapped in the "very early" stages. This information was shared on the <a href="https://youtu.be/1bFaIYn9H3g">same outlet's weekly podcast</a>. Here's exactly what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They [Ubisoft] also recently cancelled Star Wars Outlaws 2, because that was planned and in the works. It didn’t enter production, as far as I know. It wasn’t set in stone."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/ubisofts-disastrous-2024-may-lead-to-the-company-going-private">hasn't had the best run over the past year</a> – with multiple titles, including Star Wars Outlaws, falling short of the company's financial expectations, along with delays of games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> (a title which could also potentially be on the way to the Switch 2 in the future).</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will launch for the Switch 2 on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>. If we hear anything else about the supposed sequel and its cancellation, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>If you end up purchasing the full game on the Switch 2, it will cost you <strong>$79.99 / £66.99</strong>. And if you decide to upgrade your Switch copy, you'll need to pay <strong>$19.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>
<p>So, vote in our poll and tell us in the comments about what you're planning to do.</p>

<figure><a title="Plants vs. Zombies" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/284c752077c8e/plants-vs-zombies.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a> remaster is potentially on the horizon, and it might be releasing as early as October, a new rumour suggests.</p>
<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-version-revisitee-de-plants-vs-zombies-en-approche-on-vous-revele-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-60272">Dealabs and Billbil-Kun</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/plants-vs-zombies-appears-ready-to-return-in-leaked-ps5-remaster">Push Square</a>), the remaster is reportedly called <strong>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</strong> — which could be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/plants-vs-zombies-looks-set-to-be-revived-and-reloaded-on-switch">related to the Brazilian age rating of Reloaded</a>, discovered earlier this year.</p>
<p>If the leak is correct, EA and PopCap Games' remaster of the 2009 tower defense game will be launching on Switch on 23rd October 2025 for 19,99 €. We'll also be hearing about Replanted officially within the next month — that could mean Gamescom, but it could also mean <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">a Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fuvjxgp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA87rC9nG4k" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted was originally spotted on EA's servers very briefly, before the publisher removed it. Not before video footage of the game being discovered was shared online, of course (above).</p>
<p>So it seems pretty inevitable, then. The original game was available on DS and DSiWare, but hasn't been made available on other Nintendo consoles. Considering how well loved the OG is, the remaster will probably be pretty well received.</p>
