<p>Big plans are in store</p>

<figure><a title="RE30th 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc97a8c56f7c9/re30th-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has launched <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/30th.html">a new website</a> dedicated to Resident Evil's upcoming 30th anniversary in 2026.</p>
<p>More specifically, <strong>22nd March 2026</strong> marks the 30th anniversary of the original Resident Evil on PS1. We're unsure what Capcom has in store for us to celebrate the milestone, but the website has a section marked 'Coming Soon' toward the bottom, so chances are the publisher has some big plans.</p>
<p>We do know one thing, however. 27th February 2026 will see the release of the latest mainline entry: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Currently, the title is not scheduled to launch on Switch 2, but given how much Capcom has supported the Switch over the years, we're not prepared to completely rule it out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, that's about it for now! We'll leave you with a look at two logos for the upcoming 30th anniversary; one designed to look like an archway encompassing the Umbrella logo, and the other quite literally depicting a raccoon wearing 30th anniversary shades. Badass.</p>

<p>Capcom recently provided updated sales figures for its best-selling titles, with half of the top ten games being Resident Evil titles. The best-selling of all time is currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a> remake, which is available on Switch as a Cloud download.</p>

<p>This time it'll be focused solely on the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for Switch 2, with an extensive deep dive into its gameplay from none other than director Masahiro Sakurai. What's more, it'll be a whopping 45 minutes long. Crikey!</p>
<p>If you're here, chances are you're ready to rock, but here's a quick reminder of when the Direct kicks off:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PDT / 7am MDT / 8am CDT / 9am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CEST / 4pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10pm JST / 9pm AWST / 11pm AEST</li></ul>

<p>There's just one thing bugging us...</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Gulikit - ES | ES PRO 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2304f4170f9b1/gulikit-es-es-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Gulikit has launched a new range of budget controllers with Switch 2 wake-up support.</p>
<p>The ES and ES PRO Wireless Controllers are out now and priced at <strong>£24.99 / $24.99</strong> and <strong>£29.99 / $29.99</strong> respectively (exchange rates working wonders there, we see). Aesthetically, both models are pretty similar and seem to be based on the overall design of the Xbox controller, with off-set concave analogue sticks, a faceted d-pad, and an almost identical shape.</p>
<p>The ES PRO comes in black or white, while the standard ES is more of a light grey colour with matching sticks and face buttons.</p>
<p>As for the specific features, the ES boasts Hall Effect sticks, while the ES PRO comes rocking 4000-level TMR anti-drift joysticks. Gyro aiming is supported along with d-pad directional adjustment, various vibration settings, and face button re-mapping.</p>
<p>The latter seems particularly important, since there's one thing about the ES and ES PRO that's bugging us. You've probably noticed it already, right..? Yes, the ABXY layout isn't suited to the Switch out of the box. They're the wrong way around! Oof, vexing... Still, the ability to re-map will likely resolve this issue, and let's face it, nobody stares down at their controller whilst playing a game. For the relatively cheap price, it's something we can probably forgive.</p>

<p>We can't decide which right now</p>

<figure><a title="Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e24551779a43c/silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>With yet another major games showcase just around the corner, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans are once again hoping against hope that a release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> will be confirmed.</p>
<p>This time, however, something feels different. We're mere hours away from Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, and host Geoff Keighley has posted a rather intriguing tease via <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018">X</a>. It simply shows himself in what looks to be a rather fancy hotel room, looking in the mirror whilst wearing a clown nose (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>The accompanying caption reads "First time? See you tomorrow for @gamescom ONL", with a clown emoji included for good measure.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zoswtr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Now, if you're unaware of what the heck this all means, it's essentially a blatant nod toward Silksong fans who have made it somewhat of a tradition to post clown memes and emojis during major gaming events, indicating their fruitless hope that Silksong might finally be showcased.</p>
<p>So, there are two possible outcomes here, as far as we can tell. Either Geoff is simply being a complete tool and purposefully winding up Silksong fans, or... Silksong will <em>actually</em> be shown during Gamescom ONL.</p>
<p>It seems wild to us that Keighley would go out of his way to procure a clown nose just to p*** people off, but who knows! We reckon he's fully aware of the intense backlash that would occur if that was indeed the case. So as it stands, we're leaning <em>slightly</em> toward the genuine possibility that we might finally get a release date for Silksong.</p>
<p>Or maybe the joke's on us.</p>
