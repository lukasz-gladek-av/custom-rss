<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157351/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The world is an unpredictable place, full of strife and economic instability. So, there will always be room for another cosy city builder.</p>
<p>Swiss developer Stray Fawn Studio sticks to the genre formula but delivers a charmingly fresh thematic twist. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wandering_village">The Wandering Village</a> casts you as the steward of a tiny community, striving to survive on the back of a gigantic creature that quite literally wanders a post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>
<p>Your chosen Onbu (which roughly translates to 'piggyback ride' in Japanese) ambles across the desolate landscape while villagers scramble over its vertebrae, carving out a life and unlocking the mystery of the world around them. Throughout the journey, your community makes contact with others scattered across the Onbu’s path.</p>
<p>Balancing the needs of your villagers with the well-being of their colossal host is a fascinating experience. At any point, you can pull the camera back to watch the Onbu's thunderous footsteps, and zooming out even further reveals the wider biome it currently inhabits.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157348/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, this is a traditional management sim, complete with generic building types and a straightforward research tree. But nuances start to emerge once you tailor your playstyle to the living, breathing land mass beneath your people’s feet. The symbiotic relationship between the settlers and their walking province is where the game finds its unique rhythm.</p>
<p>Early on, Onbu meanders aimlessly, occasionally stopping to graze or curling up for a nap. As you progress, you’ll unlock tools that let you influence its behaviour and eventually guide its path.</p>
<p>You’ll need to feed Onbu, treat it when it gets sick, and steer it using a giant horn. As the game unfolds, your toolset expands. Unique synergy abilities range from the wholesome (yes, you can pet the big goof) to the unsettling (sacrificing your own villagers for the creature’s benefit). An even more sinister layer of control emerges, with abilities that discipline the creature and siphon its bodily fluids for your own gain. Exploit this strange animal that lets you have festivals on its back, or make an effort to nurture it? That choice is left to you.</p>

<p>The pace of the main campaign is steady, with a reduced sense of danger that makes for a mostly relaxing experience. The challenge lies in managing staff across your growing infrastructure. Each building requires a specific number of workers, and while nomads will occasionally join your settlement, increasing the population, your workforce is often limited. You’ll find yourself frequently reassigning roles to adapt to whatever issue crops up next.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Onbu will pass through hazardous areas that can make it sick. It also needs to be fed regularly, so keeping an eye on the map for nearby grazing spots is essential for its health. You can even build a catapult to launch food into its maw.</p>
<p>The story is a bit thin, revolving around the construction of a radio tower that receives transmissions from the world beyond. From there, your village elders try to uncover what led to the collapse of civilisation, while building relationships with other settlements. Aside from a couple of beautiful, Ghibli-esque animated sequences, most of the dialogue unfolds through static text boxes.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157341/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The size of Onbu’s back makes the build area limited and manageable. Still, things can get hectic. In the late game, you’ll have an army of villagers zipping around at 4x speed, creating a lively little metropolis. The Switch handles things surprisingly well, although zooming in while fast-forwarding occasionally caused a slight judder on the older hardware. Everything is pure controller input, with no touchscreen functionality. Performance on Switch 2 appeared flawless, with the larger screen complementing the format nicely while undocked.</p>
<p>While the main story is diverting enough, with multiple layers of difficulty to tweak your game, there are also a couple of other modes designed to encourage that just-one-more-go mentality.</p>
<p>Challenge Mode offers a collection of modifiers that adjust the experience, making it as punishing or forgiving as you’d like. There's also a Sandbox Mode, which allows you to disable some of the Onbu and villager debuffs, giving you the freedom to coast through an endless campaign. This level of accessibility is greatly appreciated and often missing from other titles of this ilk.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157345/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Managing an ever-growing community on what is essentially a Tamagotchi the size of an aircraft carrier is an inspired experience that engages throughout its campaign and into the freeform modes. It delivers the familiar elements of the sim management genre, but with an added layer of responsibility: cohabiting with, neglecting, or even ruling over your adopted home.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Wandering Village is a worthy addition to the city-builder genre. It's a mostly undemanding hybrid that mixes sim management with a touch of pet care. A slight experience, with an uninspired and slow-moving story, but it still manages to charm in its own quiet way.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Game-Key Card - RAIDOU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cecbe85d71493/game-key-card-raidou.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game-Key Cards, it's safe to say, haven't gone down too well with the Nintendo community.</p>
<p>With rumours heavily indicating that the only Switch 2 cartridge currently on offer to third-party developers is the full-fat 64GB model, the vast majority of games so far have arrived on Game-Key Cards. This means that you need to download the full game from the eShop upon insertion of the cartridge into the console.</p>
<p>Many have expressed their views online about Game-Key Cards, and it appears that Nintendo is, at the very least, conducting some of its own research over in Japan. As reported by <a href="https://switchsoku.com/nintendo/114247">SwitchSoku</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-gauging-player-opinion-on-switch-2s-game-key-cards-in-japan/">VGC</a>), the company has sent out a quick survey seeking player feedback on Game-Key Cards.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7kpuizq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's pretty straightforward stuff: the survey simply attempts to gauge to what extent players are aware of Game-Key Cards and how they work, and whether such knowledge affects their choice of media. Essentially, it asks whether customers would rather buy games on a Game-Key Card or as a download.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the three survey questions and their choices:</p>
<h3>Did you know that Nintendo Switch 2 packaged software includes a game card called a “Game Key Card”?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I own Game Key Card software</li>
<li>I don’t own Game Key Card software but I know about it.</li>
<li>I don’t know about Game Key Card software.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do you know anything about the characteristics of the Game Key Cards? Please select all that you know.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have downloaded the main game data, you can start playing without connecting to the internet.</li>
<li>When playing the game for the first time, you will need to download the game data via the internet.</li>
<li>Free space on the device’s internal memory or microSD Express card is required to download the main content.</li>
<li>You can play the game on another console by downloading the game data and inserting the key card.</li>
<li>You must insert the key card into the console to play the game.</li>
<li>I never knew any of this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After reading the above explanation, if you wanted to buy a piece of software and there was a Game Key Card or a download version available, which would you choose? Please choose the answer that applies.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I want to buy Game Key Cards as much as possible.</li>
<li>I would rather buy a Game Key Card.</li>
<li>I can’t choose either.</li>
<li>I would rather buy the download version.</li>
<li>I want to buy the download version as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It's tough to know at this stage whether the survey results might affect Nintendo's reliance on Game-Key Cards in the future, but we suspect that quite a few folks might tick the 'I can't choose either' option on the last question.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, recently attempted to explain the company's decision to introduce Game-Key Cards for the Switch 2 during the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">annual Shareholder meeting</a>. He said it was down to the "larger game data sizes on Nintendo Switch 2 compared to Nintendo Switch", which very much sounds like something to appease publishers and developers rather than the end user.</p>
<p>Big-name titles that have released as a Game-Key Card so far include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</a>.</p>

<p>Are you excited? Because we are excited! Yes, it's getting mighty close to the return of everyone's favourite video game ape, and to celebrate Nintendo has posted a little movie on its social media (and to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> app, naturally) to remind us all that there are precisely <em>three days to go</em> until the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Nice! We hope DK gets over that rather crushing blow in time for our adventures later this week, though.</p>
<p>Of course, for a game that hadn't really got us particularly excited in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 itself, Bananza has rapidly become one of our most-anticipated games of the year over the past month or so.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8nlqowh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game's excellent Direct did lots to whet our appetites, revealing the clever layered world and smashing traversal styles at the heart of it all, and finding out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">the Super Mario Odyssey team are behind this one</a> has now got us 100% on board.</p>
<p>It seems that physical copies of the game have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">found their way into gamers' hands already</a>, but the rest of us don't have too long to wait until the Thursday launch. How many days was it again? Make sure to check out our preview of the game, too, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">which is sounding mighty positive thus far</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the DK sphere, the game's director has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-director-acknowledges-performance-drops-we-prioritized-fun-and-playability">acknowledged some performance dips</a>, and a copyright filing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-might-be-getting-his-own-movie">suggests</a> the ape may be getting his very own movie.<em><br></em></p>
