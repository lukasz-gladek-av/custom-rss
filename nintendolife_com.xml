<header><section>
<p>Plus a neat charity collaboration</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rue_valley">Rue Valley</a>, a narrative RPG heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, has been confirmed for the Switch in addition to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>No release date has been set at the time of writing, but we're keeping a close eye on this one. It looks pretty awesome; definitely a little more upbeat and comedic than what Disco Elysium offered, but still retaining some of the same DNA.</p>
<p>Publisher Owlcat Games has also announced a collaboration with Movember, a leading men's health charity, aiming "to showcase how the immersive power of gaming can be used to explore mental health in new and meaningful ways".</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key themes of the collaboration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Meeting Players Where They Are:</strong> Using gaming as a familiar non‑clinical space, <em>Rue Valley</em> provides a natural approach to promote mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>- <strong>Gaming as Connection and Healing:</strong> Through the dynamic narrative and compelling characters, players are encouraged to reflect and engage in meaningful conversations.</p>
<p>- <strong>Normalizing Therapy:</strong> <em>Rue Valley</em>’s thoughtful approach to storytelling helps players explore what therapy can feel like in a safe, immersive way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the game itself will see you craft your own personality traits as you look to break free from a time loop and discover the secrets of Rue Valley. It's got the same isometric presentation as Disco Elysium, and a lot of the narrative elements definitely remind us of our exploits as Lieutenant Harrier "Harry" Du Bois.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ex-Disco Elysium staff have since formed a new studio called Longdue, and are hard at work <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/ex-disco-elysium-devs-reveal-a-spiritual-successor-is-in-the-works">creating a spiritual successor to the critically-acclaimed CRPG</a>.</p>
