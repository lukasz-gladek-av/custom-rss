<p>I suspect many of my fellow parents can relate to this, but when you have your first child, a whole bevvy of problems that never existed before are suddenly thrust upon you.</p>

<p>Granted, a lot of these aren’t necessarily ‘problems’ as such, rather minor inconveniences that, along with frequent moments of unbridled joy, make up the weird and wonderful world of parenthood. I do, however, have a bit of a bone to pick with Nintendo, specifically with its approach to game difficulty in the last mainline Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Before having a child, the idea of lowering a game’s difficulty had honestly never really entered my mind. If anything, I would crank the difficulty up wherever I could in the hope that it would both extend my overall playtime and provide a unique sense of accomplishment. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/halo">Halo</a> on Legendary? No problem. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> on Climax? Is that all you've got?</p>
<p>This all changed, however, when my daughter expressed interest in playing Mario Wonder. She watched the <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and became somewhat obsessed with the characters – especially Princess Peach. She’s only three, so I knew immediately that if I’m going to let her play, I’d need to make sure it was as approachable as possible, despite my own proclivities.</p>
<p>As you might know, however, Super Mario Bros. Wonder essentially locks its lower difficulty setting to specific characters: Nabbit and four Yoshis. So when the character select screen came up, I gently tried to explain this to my daughter, knowing full well how the conversation would go.</p>
<p><em>“Now listen, if you go for one of <strong>these</strong> characters, the game will be a bit easier for you and you’ll have a lot more fun.”<br></em><em>“I want to be Princess Peach thoooough!”<br></em><em>“That might be a bit trickier. If you go for the purple rabbit, it’ll be better.”<br></em><em>“No, Princess Peach!”</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="d3b1fe9bd18f7"><a title="SSMBW - Nabbit 02" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3b1fe9bd18f7/ssmbw-nabbit-02.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"You'll play as Nabbit and you'll LIKE IT!"</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Sigh.</em> Anyone who’s had the pleasure of raising a three-year-old knows that it’s borderline impossible to change their mind once their heart is set on something. In this case, Princess Peach is my daughter’s favourite character from the movie, so <em>of course</em> she’s going to want to play as her. This meant we'd have to do without the perks – including <em>invincibility</em> – that come with Yoshi or Nabbit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how did it go? Well, rather predictably, not well. The opening stage – Welcome to the Flower Kingdom – was doable, but it went rapidly downhill from there. I knew that changing to Yoshi or Nabbit wasn’t suddenly going to make the game a cakewalk; after all, while both characters boast unique abilities that would theoretically make most scenarios easier, there’s still the task of actually navigating the levels. Given my daughter’s age and inexperience, even that would no doubt prove quite the challenge.</p>
<p>Still, it seems baffling to me that Nintendo would create a game aimed at children and families and not offer any optional difficulty settings for the majority of its 12 playable characters. No offence to Nabbit, but no child wants to play him when the likes of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach are sitting right there; especially when the Illumination movie had such an immediate, profound influence on my daughter's perception and preferences.</p>
<p>And yes, I know Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options, in my eyes.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I managed to convince her so she could enjoy the game, but she was exceptionally stubborn in her desire to play as Peach. And honestly? I'm quite proud of that. It makes me think that perhaps, way off in the future, she'll be playing her games on higher difficulties just like me... Or she just loves Peach and wants to play as her – yeah, that's probably it. In the end, though, she gave up and went back to playing with her Peach plushie.</p>
<figure data-uuid="585a5d013f786"><a title="SMBW - Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/585a5d013f786/smbw-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yeah... She never got this far.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> have proven that even the most challenging of experiences can be accessible to almost anybody when it has the right options in place. Quite frankly, I think with invincibility turned on and unlimited stamina applied, my daughter could probably have more fun with Celeste than she did with Mario Wonder – and I consider the latter to be <em>much</em> easier on its default settings.</p>
<p>So come on, sort it out, Nintendo. You've made some strides with difficulty and accessibility options over the years, but you've clearly got a long way to go. Applying blanket difficulty settings to a tentpole Mario title seems like the most basic of tasks when your goal is to reach as many potential players as possible, but as ever, the company stubbornly does things its own way.</p>
<p>Forcing those who want a breezier time to play as a specific character, though..? Nah, that ain't it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - December 2025</h2>

<h3>"a lot of stick" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Greedy Nintendo! Time and again we hear it, Nintendo are greedy! It is a line that gets repeated so often, I wonder if people actually consider what it means. Shareholders? Nintendo's dividend payments place them just behind Microsoft, as well as many other companies in the gaming sector like Koei Tecmo, Square Enix and Capcom. Executives? In 2024 Shuntaro Furukawa was paid just over a fifth of what Phil Spencer earns at Microsoft. But Nintendo charge too much, especially for older games! Maybe that is true, but they pay their staff quite well and have really high retention rates, they also seem to reinvest what they earn from their popular titles in more niche titles, so maybe the latest release of Super Mario Galaxy will pay fro a new Famicom Detective Club, Another Code or Advance Wars. I also don't think that Gameshare is a feature that screams greed. Nintendo are getting a lot of stick at the moment, and they do make some wrong headed decisions at times, but as far as massive corporations go, they seem ok. We've all gotten used to low prices in gaming, but low prices, high development costs and a fandom that is often reluctant to compromise on quality, is not a recipe for a sustainable industry.<br>
<strong><em>Andrew Mcleod</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't disagree that Nintendo, <em>generally</em>, seems to focus on the right things when it comes to experimenting with new ideas, respecting employees, and doing things that other companies wouldn't or couldn't do. That's why we're all here.</p>
<p>It would be great if everything were cheaper, but again, <em>generally</em> Nintendo does a decent job of threading the needle on pricing - although a $50 Kirby amiibo feels like a real ask. Welcome Tour should absolutely have been a pack-in, too, so I get the frustration, especially in this economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, I don't think the company needs us defending it from a little childish name-calling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sweaty"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there Nintendo Life!<br>
I wanted to shout out a franchise that I think doesn't get enough credit: Just Dance. I feel like Just Dance is often seen as just that one yearly Ubisoft release that nobody bats an eye at. But this year reestablished for me what a powerhouse it is for social and energetic fun.</p>
<p>This feeling came to me at Comic Con. There was a huge Just Dance setup and it was constantly packed with people. Joining these crowds for the first time was an experience. There's nothing quite like being in cosplay, standing in a crowd of other con-goers and cosplayers, and jumping around to Boney M.'s Rasputin or teaming up with a stranger for Lady Gaga's Abracadabra. No other game there generated the kind of loud and mass fun that Just Dance did, and that's an achievement.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Its appeal is nearly universal. I've enjoyed the game with all kinds of people and in all kinds of places, including in gamer spaces. There's this lovely gaming space I frequent, stacked with consoles and games, so we can play just about anything we want there. Yet a bit ago I booted up Just Dance, and it was a smash hit. We had a blast waving our arms and stepping around the room, with wide grins and loud cries of energetic joy. (Also, shoutout to the accessibility filter and accessible dance routines, so people that can't stand or jump could also join in.)</p>
<p>And speaking of moving around, that's another thing I have to praise Just Dance for. I don't exercise nearly enough: I find it very hard to push myself to do so and I feel deeply uncomfortable and unsafe at gyms. But Just Dance is fun, motivating and accessible enough for me to get up and move with it at least every couple of days. With Just Dance+ there's more than enough songs to keep things fresh, and trying to learn the difficult expert routines to songs like Dua Lipa's Houdini or Britney Spears's Circus and Toxic is genuinely a really fun challenge. I'm not going to act like it's a substitute for proper exercise, but it's a heck of a lot better than nothing and I guarantee you that some of these routines will get you sweaty. You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying, I'd love to see it.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Just Dance is a high quality game with lovely visuals, fun and varied choreo's, and appeal everyone including many hardcore gamers. I know it's not for everyone, nothing is, but in so many groups it's been a guaranteed good time for many years, and it deserves more credit for that. Love you Just Dance!<br>
<strong>Zander</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, it suffers from being the known-est of quantities in 2025, but Just Dance is decent and I've had fun with it over the years.</p>
<p>Honestly<em>,</em> "<em>You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying</em>" is prime bonus letter material, Zander. But we're staunch Boney M defenders in this household, and I wouldn't be able to embed this video in the bonus section. Wunderbar. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"throw my hat"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With all this talk about animal crossing I've seen a lot of debates about whether new leaf or new horizons is the best. I'd figured I would throw my hat in the ring. I grew up playing new leaf so I have a very strong emotional attachment to that game. I think neither is better than the other. When I play new horizons there are things I wish it had that new leaf, and when I play new leaf there are things I wish it had that new horizons had. For those at the NL towers who have played both what do y'all think?<br>
<strong>beltmenot</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wild World was my first, so the impact of anything afterwards is lessened - in my brain, WW is still peak. New Leaf and New Horizons are pretty much on a par. For all the improvements, NH has gotten unwieldy with items accessible in too many different places for my taste, and more to come in the January update. And I'd give anything for an icon that shows if you already own an item on sale in Nook's Cranny!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/poll-so-animal-crossing-new-leaf-or-new-horizons-which-do-you-like-best">We have discussed this before</a>, and most of the team are off on their hols now, but let me see who I can find ransacking the office fridge for party leftovers... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"NL is way better. Too much crafting in NH, it felt like a chore – NL was honed to near perfection." - <em>Ollie</em></li>
<li>"NL - <em>love</em> NH, but the fiddly island customisation, the more homogenous villager personalities, and the huge focus on decorating gets away from what I adored in NL. NL felt a lot more compact and impactful to me." <em>- Alana</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>"nothing substantial"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendo Life,<br>
been a while since I joined Your community.<br>
last time i wrote a fan letter i was a kid and wrote to power and games, an italian vg magazine, asking for SFII advice on how to beat m. bison at hard level.<br>
no reply.<br>
I'm 43 and I am writing to you now with nothing substantial to say except for congrats on your hard work.<br>
greetings from Genova, Italy.<br>
<strong>Skoffo</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Skoffo! Greetings to you from the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>I'll get back to you with the Bison tips. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"in lieu"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a Splatoon fan, and I know there are others hiding around here somewhere, so in lieu of any news whatsoever at all about Splatoon Raiders or an 11.0.0 update for Splatoon 3, I am here with a list of tiny paint-based games to suggest. Or rather, a tiny list of tiny games, because this genre is not huge, apparently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ink">INK</a> - This is legit my favorite platformer! It's got a such a fun gimmick, good difficulty, and is super satisfying to speedrun! I have nothing more to say, just go buy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a> - This is essentially a Mario Party minigame, yes, but it's super fun! If you've got kids, or nieces, or nephews, or other little ones in your life, this is a good time! (Plus it's being updated regularly, so if you ever have suggestions... send 'em in to Hey! Kookaburra and he'll probably implement them.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> - It's on NSO, and like... 67% of you probably have this, so give it a whirl!</p>
<p>OK, thank you for reading my tiny list of tiny games with ink-based aspects. Have a nice day, and stay fresh!<strong><br>
CaleBoi25</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't have NSO, I know a man who's got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">a few copies of Mario Paint</a>. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"There could be a Pokémon game collection with Gen 1, 2 and 3 with remakes included." - <strong>Your fan, Scottdevine48</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine how much greedy Nintendo would charge for that? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hello NintendoLife,<br>
Could you please publish PSA articles about NSO game trials? Not everyone is always online and they are easy to miss." - <strong><em>Morsel</em></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a rolling guide might be best. I'll see what we can do. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I got an NSO N64 controller and realised that it can be used to play Mario Kart 8. Do you know what other non-Nintendo Classics games it works with?" - <strong>OswaldTheLuckyGamer</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything that doesn't require a second stick? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I just want to say, I love nearly all of you." - <strong>Ed.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Feature: I Play This One Particular SNES Game Every Xmas As A Personal Tradition]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-play-this-one-particular-snes-game-every-xmas-as-a-personal-tradition</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It was the Christmas of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/svcznf9cxtY?si=XFI81dUw7IU_LgNC">Mr Blobby</a> was the funniest thing on television (according to your parents), and <a href="https://youtu.be/3JWTaaS7LdU?si=X88fExf5WKFM4q0D">Whitney Houston</a> had been tricked into singing a love song about everyone's favourite sentient cardigan, Kevin Costner (I feel like I'm having a war flashback now).</p>
<p>And me? Well, I was having a great time despite all of this, actually. Because Santa had done me a massive solid.</p>
<p>Now, two things. Firstly, Santa hadn't done a toilet in my lounge. That's not what I mean at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I was 14 years old in 1992, so I shouldn't have been asking my bewildered and frightened parents (Mr Blobby-loving fools) to send a rather bullish letter to the North Pole requesting — demanding — a Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<p>With the arrival of this tour-de-force into to the sitting room of my Dickensian home on 25th December 1992, I, for the first time ever, was experiencing graphical and gameplay parity (<a href="https://youtu.be/BiufDI8cBkU?si=8WK4Z9utZUC-3ee2">after a lot of trying on my beloved Commodore 64</a>) with the local arcade version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">The World Warrior</a>, where I had previously been spending all the money I could steal from my Mr Blobby-loving dad to feed my addiction to Eddie Honda's big shiny chest. (Don't worry, I never paid him back.)</p>

<p>This was my first Nintendo console! My first console of any kind that was mine, in fact, and as a result of this, and because it was the first game that really made me feel as though the home experience could indeed match the flashy side of the arcade one, Street Fighter 2 has — and always will have — a very special place in my heart. It was a bonus, really, that it was also phenomenal to play as well as to sit and stare at.</p>
<p>In a way that it's hard to convey today, when we're drowning in deep and meaningful gaming experiences, and when gamers have grown up with home consoles that give them the best of everything at their fingertips, Street Fighter 2 awakened me to the possibility that, for me, gaming might not, like a puppy for example, be just for Christmas.</p>
<p>And this is the serious bit, the 'science bit' if you will. Because I grew up in a time and place that happened entirely before the internet (and possibly before Jesus, but that's another Christmas story for another Christmastime), it was very easy to feel cut off and left behind in matters technologic. Such was life in rural '80s and '90s Ireland; lots of cow s**t, not so much of the latest high street cool s**t.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3cc5bfd3621c5"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3cc5bfd3621c5/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Street Fighter 2, though, with those fancy arcade-perfect graphics and noises and music, well, that was what everyone who knew anything was playing and talking about that particular year's end (in my young mind), and I was now playing and talking about it, too. Mostly to myself, but you can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>It seems like nothing, and it is! But that little glimmer of feeling as though I was involved was, for a wee guy who was yet to meet any other real-world gaming pals, and for someone who lived quite remotely, it was a big deal to be riding the latest wave of excitement. You couldn't just hit someone up in their DMs back then, y'know. Connections hit different.</p>
<p>And so, because I'm a legit saddo (as you'll now know and understand), every Christmas <em>to this very day</em> I still boot up the old Street Fighter 2 on my SNES (not my OG machine, unfortunately) and dig into one or two runs of its fabulous arcade mode. It's a game that's never aged in my mind; it looks as good as it ever did in its detailed pugilists, atmospheric environments and delightful little background animations. And complaints about the awful frame rate will get you banned from my Xmas party punch bowl, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>It ties a bow on my festive period, it drowns me in just right volume of intoxicating nostalgia, and it reminds me of more innocent times. All of that guff.</p>
<p>But it also marks a point where I remember vividly having shifted from loving games and playing games for what they were to wanting to keep them in my life as a thing that helped me connect and feel connected. And I guess that's what I'm still doing to this day.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to show my sons how red and trembly my face goes when I can't reliably pull off Vega's wall dive. Merry Christmas and that.</p>

<p>It will come as no surprise, then, that we were rather excited to see a sequel on the way. Announced in June 2023 and confirmed to be coming to Switch at the June 2024 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/tabletop-inspired-rpg-citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-gets-january-release">PC Gaming Showcase</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> promises more of the same deep space dilemmas, but with an expanded dice system, clean-cut job roles and multiple environments to explore, we were keen to learn more about its new recruits before liftoff.</p>
<p>Sitting for a chat with Gareth Damian Martin (of the game's one-person team, Jump Over The Age), we aimed to do just that. Our conversation covered an intergalactic range of topics, including the pressure of making a sequel, the game's TTRPG roots and their plans for the future.</p>
<p>So, don your space suits and buckle up, Sleeper, it's time to talk spaaaaace...</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Citizen Sleeper was a huge success back in 2022, but you’ve said in the past that a sequel wasn’t the natural next project for you. What was it that made you want to come back to this universe for Citizen Sleeper 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gareth Damian Martin, Jump Over The Age:</strong> I’m a big fan of making experimental projects, and inventing new designs within games, which means a sequel isn’t always my first instinct. But with Citizen Sleeper, I felt there was still so much more of the experiment to do! The first game was fairly modest in terms of system and scale, so it left plenty of space for new systems and ideas. In particular, I’m a big fan of “ship and crew” sci-fi series like <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> and <strong>Farscape,</strong> but I have always felt games never quite got the genre right. So it was exciting to try to make one of these stories within the Citizen Sleeper universe, which I felt was ideally suited to this kind of storytelling.</p>
<p>In the end, I felt like there was an opportunity to build on the first game while also offering something equally fresh and different so that the two games could sit alongside each other as a pair.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2246b1082effe"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2246b1082effe/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2, like its predecessor, is about a lot of different things: capitalism, humanity, survival, loneliness, etc. What are the biggest challenges of balancing so many themes when it comes to writing a story like this?</strong></p>
<p>I have to be honest, I don’t really write “thematically” when I’m telling a story. I’m not really focused on making statements. Instead, I am very interested in my characters and the different paths they can take through the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I start writing, I often have a lot of situations in my mind that feel interesting or exciting. I might have an idea for a contract where you instigate a mutiny on a ship in the middle of a general strike or an idea for a group of characters who are all pursuing the same long-lost interstellar drive. I select and invent these based on my own interests, so the reason Citizen Sleeper has these themes is because that’s what interests me in the world! That’s when I really set up the subjects of the story, and from that point on, my mind is focused on who the characters are, how they speak, how the world works, and what might make for a compelling plot.</p>
<p>Some stories are compelling because they are tense and pacy, others because they are introspective and heartfelt. For me, the beauty of Citizen Sleeper is that the game can contain all these atmospheres and stories at once, so I don’t worry too much about balancing. If it interests me and seems like a strong story, I try to get it in!</p>
<p><strong>Despite sharing some narrative DNA, this sequel feels like it can be played by those unfamiliar with the first entry. How important was it for you to create something that continues the Citizen Sleeper universe, but also works as a standalone?</strong></p>
<p>I think this is always an important part of making a sequel, you have to assume that this is the first game for players. But rather than see this as a limit, I saw it as an opportunity. I have always been a big fan of time skips in stories. When done well, they mix all the existing ingredients of the story, and then the reader or player gets to feel smart and curious as they piece it all back together and tell their own story of what happened in the missing time between.</p>
<p>What is especially fun with a time skip is they often allow for the prequel/sequel order to be read in either way, as discovering where a character came from is as compelling as discovering where they end up. So this was a big focus when making the game, and I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games and being surprised by the often unusual journeys characters may take.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ebd649438a817"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebd649438a817/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The sequel appears to be much more rooted in the RPG genre, with clearly defined class skills, missions and expanded dice mechanics as just a few additions. Were there any other games (video or tabletop) that inspired these mechanics during development?</strong></p>
<p>As with the first game, Citizen Sleeper 2 was massively inspired by designs and concepts from pen-and-paper TTRPGs. <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel">Blades in the Dark</a> was the first tabletop game I ever ran, and it remains my favourite. It inspired the first game, and with the sequel, I saw the opportunity to adapt more of its systems into a video game. Citizen Sleeper 2’s “push” mechanic, where you accrue stress to gain a bonus to or reroll your dice, is a direct inspiration from that game, and its systems are designed around asking the player to “push their luck”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the stress systems I added to Citizen Sleeper 2, I took inspiration from the myriad of stress systems appearing in tabletop games over the past five years, but especially <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gerdling/mothership-sci-fi-horror-rpg-1st-edition-boxed-set">Mothership</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart:_The_City_Beneath">Heart: The City Beneath</a>. There’s so much good and exciting game design happening in the tabletop scene, and I find it a constant inspiration for my own work.</p>
<p>On the video game side, my main touchstone was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/mass_effect_2">Mass Effect 2</a>. I wouldn’t say I was attempting to replicate anything from Mass Effect 2, however, more that I wanted to make a game that approached similar ideas in a different way. I often find this is a way I like to work in games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/in_other_waters">In Other Waters</a> was my own take on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, refocusing it on scanning and xenobiology. In the same way, Citizen Sleeper is my own take on the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series, shifting the focus from saving the galaxy as a supercop to learning to live and survive in the margins of an interstellar society.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8285810a21037"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8285810a21037/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With community and home being such an important part of the first game, how does this theme play into the larger setting of the Starward Belt in the sequel, and what challenges do the new hubs pose for the Sleeper?</strong></p>
<p>Ideas of home play out a little differently in Citizen Sleeper 2: rather than having a massive urban megastructure as the location, the game plays out over a series of scattered habitats of varying size and style. Because of this, your home really becomes the Rig, a ship you have stolen and that expands and changes over the course of the game. I really want to capture that slow and subtle process of transformation as the ship gains crew and becomes more familiar, and often in writing the game, I found that to be in contrast with the Hubs, which ultimately, you always have to leave.</p>
<p>So I think at the heart of the game is a tension between moving on and settling down, which feels very important to the Citizen Sleeper series in general.</p>
<p><strong>There were many stressful moments in Citizen Sleeper, and now Stress is a mechanic in the sequel. Why did you decide to implement this, and what effect will it have on your relationships in-game?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely, while also opening up the possibility of more stories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stress systems are a fairly popular and well-battle-tested element in many contemporary TTRPGs, and I think that’s because they offer an abstract form of harm vs Health Points. You might take stress from a heist, a difficult negotiation, or babysitting a child, but you hopefully wouldn’t take HP damage! This allows for a broader range of challenges for players and also consequences. I was really aware of the possibilities this opened up for telling a broader range of stories from running TTRPGs, especially ones that aren’t focused on combat. So this was one of the first things I wanted to add to the sequel.</p>
<p>As I developed these ideas in Citizen Sleeper 2, stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game. It represents the stress your body is under and the possibility that the pressure might turn into real and permanent harm. It represents your crew’s eagerness to continue working on a contract when things don’t go well. It also represents more abstract ideas, like how quickly a derelict ship is falling apart, or the opinions of a disgruntled crew turning against their captain. So stress bars of various kinds will have a huge effect on your path through Citizen Sleeper 2, and I think managing them is one of the most compelling and tense parts of the game.</p>
<p>This time around, I really wanted the game to be stressful, compelling and filled with emergent stories of success and failure. Stress is the tool that allows me to achieve that.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8d4943da6bf49"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d4943da6bf49/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You recently told</strong> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-will-be-the-last-citizen-sleeper-video-game"><strong>Eurogamer</strong></a> <strong>that Citizen Sleeper 2 would be the last video game in the Citizen Sleeper universe, but a tabletop adaptation is still on the cards for the future. How does it feel to be thinking about returning the game to its tabletop roots and is there anything you feel will be lost/gained in the process?</strong></p>
<p>I’m very early in the process of making a Citizen Sleeper TTRPG (as you might imagine, I’ve been busy with the sequel!), but I have a very clear objective with it. I’m really happy with the two games and the story they tell in this universe. I think Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely while also opening up the possibility of more stories. My aim with the TTRPG is to hand the tools to tell those stories over to the player and to let them carry whichever threads catch their interest forward with their friends (or start totally new ones).</p>
<p>What gets left behind by doing that is, of course, my own presence as the narrator of those stories, but I think after two games, there are a lot of references for people to go to if that’s what they want. What is gained is the radical openness of a tabletop system, the chance for players to fill in the gaps in a meaningful way and really explore their connections to the universe’s characters and ideas. Which, in a way, is what these games have been about all along.</p>
