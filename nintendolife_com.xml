<figure data-uuid="125f45ffa1eab"><a title="Pokemon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/125f45ffa1eab/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you missed it, the first season of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> Ranked Battles is already underway. It will run from now until 4th November 2025, and gives trainers who reach 'Rank K' a special reward of <strong>Greninjite</strong>. This item can be used to Mega Evolve Greninja into Mega Greninja, and "can't be obtained through normal gameplay".</p>
<p>The official Pokémon website further explains the three types of rewards for Ranked Battles. You'll get rewards at the end of the battle (regardless of your performance), and promotion rewards are gained when you advance to the next rank (this includes items for training such as Mega Shards). The last type of reward is a seasonal reward, which is based on your ranking at the end of a season.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown of first season of Ranked Battles, including eligible Pokémon, how to start a ranked battle, and how to receive rewards:</p>
