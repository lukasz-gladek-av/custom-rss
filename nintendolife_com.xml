</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Illumination have revealed the first proper trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, and it's a galactic banger.</p>
<p>We get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosaline, plus a whole bunch of new locations based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>? Yep, there's representation from both games here.</p>
<p>New cast members have also been confirmed, with Brie Larson (<strong>Captain Marvel</strong>, <strong>Room</strong>) taking on the role of Rosalina, and Benny Safdie stepping into the shoes of Bowser Jr. If that name doesn't quite ring a bell, Safdie has acted in a number of projects, but is perhaps more notable for is directorial work on <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> and <strong>The Smashing Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the trailer also reiterates the planned release date of <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, which isn't too far off at this point. Like the first movie, it seems more than likely that we'll get another Direct / trailer at some point in the next few months or so, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>And if you're interested in seeing the whole Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct, you can watch the Shigeru Miyamoto-hosted video below:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160456/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Sega and developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are seemingly on a mission to bring as many <strong>Yakuza</strong> games to the Switch 2 in as short a time span as possible. With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a> joining <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>, we’re already at three within five months of the console’s release. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> next February will make it four. Damn, Sega – keep going!</p>
<p>Kiwami 2 was originally released in 2017, and while that seems like a lifetime ago at this point (just ask <strong>Metroid</strong> fans), the underlying Dragon Engine makes it comfortably the most technically demanding entry on Switch 2 yet. I’m thrilled to confirm, then, that it’s a joyous experience from start to finish. It’s easily one of the best entries in the series, one that comes dangerously close to the highs of Yakuza 0.</p>
<p>So once again, you step into the shoes of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu who, after a short period of peace and quiet, is brought back into the criminal fold following a growing conflict between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance. Kiwami 2 features the familiar sights and sounds of the Tokyo-inspired Kamurocho, but a good chunk of the game also takes place within the Osaka-inspired Sotenbori.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160457/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wielding the might of the Dragon Engine, which made its debut in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/yakuza_6_the_song_of_life">Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</a>, both main locations look absolutely incredible. Neon lights shine brighter than ever, buildings reflect accurately off Sotenbori’s main river, and streets are filled to the brim with well-rendered residents going about their day.</p>
<p>By keeping the literal size of these cities in check, RGG Studio is able to pack them with things to see and do, and in combining this with realistic diegetic sounds like distant arcade music and the casual chatter of NCPs, it makes for one of the most vividly alive settings I’ve ever seen in a game. Take note, Game Freak.</p>
<p>The notable improvement to visuals does come with one potential drawback: 30fps performance. Both Yakuza 0 and the original Kiwami reach a stable 60fps with the previous engine on Switch 2, and while moving directly from Kiwami to Kiwami 2 did make the drop much more apparent at first, it didn’t bother me at all once I actually started playing properly.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160460/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It remains stable throughout, even during effects-heavy action sequences, and the improvements elsewhere more than make up for any initial disappointment. Not only does Kiwami 2 look <em>much</em> better, but transitions into fights and (most) interior locations are seamless, making for a significantly more modernised experience.</p>
<p>General gameplay is a familiar mix of exploration, minigames, and melee combat, with a sprinkling of RPG mechanics thrown in for good measure. Yakuza games have a remarkable ability to distract you from completing your primary objectives at every turn. So one moment you might be laying the smackdown on a formidable boss before watching the dramatic aftermath in a couple of sumptuous cutscenes, and two minutes later you’ll somehow find yourself in the men’s toilets having a literal peeing contest. It’s absurd, and I love it.</p>
<p>That’s just one of the <em>many</em> minigames. You can play darts, win prizes on claw machines, master mahjong, sing karaoke, clean up in a game of poker, and more. A true highlight was stumbling upon a Club Sega arcade joint, which houses fully playable versions of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/virtua_fighter_2">Virtua Fighter 2</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/virtual_on_cyber_troopers">Virtual On: Cyber Troopers</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160455/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The authenticity really helps the overall setting sing, and you can also buy real-life beverages like The Yamazaki and Hibiki, or dine in at a real-world eatery like Zuboraya. Stocking up on food and drink is encouraged to maintain your health, but I hardly need the excuse to browse Kiwami 2’s extensive, hunger-inducing range.</p>
<p>Watching your health is vital, mind you, since you’ll be getting into fights left, right, and centre. Naturally, a lot of scraps will take place as you progress through the main story, but the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are also riddled with gangs of thugs who won’t hesitate to start wailing on you at any given moment.</p>
<p>Unlike previous entries, Kiwami 2 doesn’t feature multiple fighting styles to switch between. You’ve only got the one here, but as someone who never really bothered with the Beast style much in the first Kiwami, I appreciate the more streamlined approach. You still have melee weapons like knives and baseball bats, while upgrades add whole new abilities to your arsenal.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160454/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each fight grants a bunch of experience points, which you can spend on general stats, battle skills, heat actions, and life skills. Overall, it feels far less fiddly than previous entries' overwhelming upgrade paths, and you’ll find yourself purchasing upgrades at frequent intervals. Once you’ve added a few new moves to your belt, powered up your heat meter, and unleashed a blistering flurry of combos, you’ll feel just like a dragon.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would matter one lick if it weren’t for the story at Kiwami 2’s core. It’s full of wild twists and turns, but the exceptional performances from Takaya Kuroda, Aya Hisakawa, Satoshi Tokushige, and more wonderful voice actors help keep everything grounded. RGG Studio's team are masters at storytelling, and they're only getting better with each new entry.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re particularly fond of the fan-favourite Goro Majima, you can play as the character once again with a short but sweet side campaign accessed via the main menu after a certain point in the main game. This covers what Majima was up to after the first game, and it proves to be a strong, albeit inessential detour.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a wonderful experience on Switch 2. The improved visuals and streamlined mechanics make for a delightful gameplay experience bolstered by a compelling narrative at its core.</p>
<p>There are so many ridiculous minigames to keep you entertained, and exploring Kamurocho and Sotenbori remains enjoyable five or even fifty hours into the game. It stands alongside Yakuza 0: Director's Cut as one of the finest entries in the series.</p></section>

<p>In Japan, at least</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Folks will no doubt be aware of Kazutoshi Iida from the cult-classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> for 64DD and GameCube, but now two of the creator's earlier titles are heading to the Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_tail_of_the_sun">Tail of the Sun</a> (1996) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_aquanauts_holiday">Aquanaut's Holiday</a> (1995) both launched for the PS1 with western publication from Sony itself. Now, Artdink is reviving both titles as part of its ARTDINK GAME LOG preservation project. Tail of the Sun will launch in Japan on <strong>16th December 2025</strong>, while Aquanaut's Holiday will follow in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARTDINK GAME LOG is a project to port and re-release game titles previously developed by ARTDINK onto modern gaming hardware.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"It serves as a record (log) of ARTDINK's game development journey. By reviving past masterpieces using current technology and platforms, it delivers nostalgia and rediscovery to longtime fans, while offering an unprecedented experience to new players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're unaware of what these titles entail, Tail of the Sun is an open-world game of sorts in which you play as a caveman with an aim to reach the sun by stacking 'ivory' from mammoths tusks. Meanwhile, Aquanaut's Holiday is an underwater simulator set in the first-person perspective in which you explore the ocean, find treasure, and interact with deep-sea creatures.</p>
<p>No release has been confirmed for western audiences at this time, but we wouldn't be surprised to see both games at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Plus an increase for new-hires</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ba04dbd7d6d21"><a title="Sonic Mania" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ba04dbd7d6d21/sonic-mania.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html">has announced</a> that it is raising the salary for its full-time staff along with increasing the starting salary for new-hires over in Japan (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Starting from 1st April 2026, the base salary for full-time employees will raise by an average of around 10%. Sega is introducing a more flexible pay structure while also converting annual bonuses into base pay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the starting salary for new university graduates will see a similar 10% increase from 300,000 to 330,000 yen (approx $2,140).</p>
<p>In the press release (via machine translation), Sega said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[SEGA] will revise the salary levels of full-time employees at its Japanese subsidiary and raise the starting salary for new employees, with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices, and of recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega had already increased its employees' base salaries back in 2023 from 222,000 to 300,000 yen, so this latest news will no doubt be very welcome to workers over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-hit-by-mass-layoffs-as-part-of-global-restructuring">Square Enix recently announced widespread restructuring of its international workforce</a>, leading to layoffs across the UK, Europe, and the US. The progress report provided notes that the changes will lead to a saving of around around 3 billion yen, or roughly $19.6 million.</p>
