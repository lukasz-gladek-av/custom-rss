<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a>'s reputation precedes it. The notoriously-difficult precision platformer is designed to be extremely challenging, and death on every single screen is basically inevitable. Amazingly, it's taken over 15 years for anyone to fully complete the game — that's get 106% completion — without dying, but it <em>finally</em> happened at the end of last year (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-taken-15-years-but-someones-finally-completed-super-meat-boy-without-dying-once">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Back in December, Nintendo speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7bnhmqT3s">shredberg</a> became the first person ever to fully complete Super Meat Boy deathless. Yes, seriously, no one has been able to do this since the game was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010. The platformer came to Switch in 2018.</p>
<p>"I've been doing this way too long" shredberg says laughing after his record-breaking win. "I'm not saying that I wasn't nervous, because I was very nervous at the end there, but I was way more nervous just in Dark Cotton... Once I got past Dark Hell 2, I was relatively fine."</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be emailing everyone — Kotaku, IGN, CNN, Chef's Illustrated. They're all going to hear about it."</p>
<p>You can watch the full two hour stream up-top, but if you've even played a few minutes of Super Meat Boy, you know how tough this game can be. shredberg, somehow, makes this look effortless.</p>
<p>Even one of the game's co-creators, Edmund McMillen, congratulated shredberg on social media with a simple "Congrats!"</p>

<p>Sharing his achievement on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Supermeatboy/comments/1pnjrqr/i_got_106_without_dying/">Supermeatboy subreddit</a>, shredberg thinks it took him "like 700-800 hours of grinding" to reach this goal, which is staggering.</p>
<p>He's been streaming much of his progress over on Twitch over the years, in-between other speedruns for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's next? Some followers on the archived stream have made some suggestions for shredberg, such as playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or other games. Whatever it is, we hope shredberg has fun. Congrats on the record!</p>

You made it! Congrats!</p>
<p>Of course, we start the year off by looking at the last month of 2025, December. And boy, what a December we had — probably one of the most-stacked we've ever had, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>'s release and a bunch of surprise Nintendo Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>Of course, that means the eShop has been pretty busy, with some genuine surprises sneaking in before the Holiday season. So we've voted for the best of the best of the digital-only selection. The reles, as always: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from December 2025 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wiqtgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Alrighty then, let's have a look at the very best of December's eShop releases.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:195306,181925 @ 1767732152 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We don't think anyone was expecting the amount of game releases we got in December 2025. Usually, the end of the year is a little quieter, but we were kept rather busy in the run up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Of course, there are two bigger games we haven't had the chance to review yet — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> dropped on Christmas Day in the US, and we're working on covering that very soon. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, which (now-former) Nintendo Lifer Felix <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">ranks among his favourite games of the year</a>, also slipped through the cracks of a busy festive period.</p>
<p>That leaves us with a total of eight games that scored an 8//10 or above that are eShop exclusives (at the time of writing this). Here's the five that didn't quite make the top in a closely-fought battle of votes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">9/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">3rd Place - Marvel Cosmic Invasion (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Trust Tribute Games to give us a near-perfect Marvel beat 'em up in the same vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>. And that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> is — not only a love letter to Marvel's rich comic book history, but a beautiful and excellent arcade side-scroller.</p>
<p>The roster is surprisingly robust and varied here, with every character feeling extremely distinct. And with the tag-team mechanic, you can play through the game multiple times with your favourite pairings and change things up as many times as you want. Add in the unlockable hard mode, and you have your new favourite co-op experience with a friend.</p>
<p>Available on both Switch 1 and 2 — and fantastic on both platforms — we scored the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">an 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Sonic Racing CrossWorlds -(Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Surprise! Speeding onto Switch 2 at the end of the 2025, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is <em>finally</em> fully realised on the newer console. Yes, it is getting a full physical later in 2026, but right now, this is a digital-only purchase or upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for this port, too, as CrossWorlds really struggled on the older hardware. Here, it's beautifully smooth with sharper resolutions and 60fps in both docked and handheld mode; all the other excellent bells and whistles are in tact, meaning this excellent racer can stand alongside Mario Kart World as one of the system's best, at least in the early days.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds scored an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10 from us</a>, and there's more free content and DLC to come in the future.</p>

</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">1st Place - despelote (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>One of 2025's very best games released on other platforms earlier in 2025 — <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/nobodys-really-heard-of-it-but-this-is-one-of-my-xbox-games-of-the-year-for-2025">Pure Xbox</a> is among the outlets celebrating it — and it <em>just</em> managed to squeak its way onto Switch in December. And thank goodness, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> is a special one, and it barely beat out Sonic to win December's eShop Selects.</p>
<p>This short, sweet game follows Julián as he reflects on the time Ecuador qualified for the 2002 World Cup. This is not a soccer game, though — it's a beautiful narrative tale about Julián's experience growing up amidst this fervour. It's largely flown under the radar, but those who have played it have raved about it. And we're joining the chorus.</p>
<p>despelote scored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/despelote">a well-deserved 9/10 from us</a> and takes the final eShop Selects trophy of 2025.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-december-2025]]></content:encoded>
