<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158069/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Though it may feel like the ‘quirky’ branch of indie JRPGs has become a played out trope by now, it wasn’t too long ago that a confusing, humorous, and parodying take on the standard template was seen as a novel concept. One of the most significant examples of this was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/off">OFF</a>, a simple freeware RPG Maker project that caught fire on Tumblr in the late 2000s and inspired the development of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omori">OMORI</a>, <strong>Yume Nikki</strong>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>.</p>
<p>Now, developer Mortis Ghost (along with Fangamer) has put out a modestly tweaked remaster of the game for Switch and PC, introducing the classic to a new generation while also polishing up some of its rougher edges. I’m pleased to say that this remaster has largely stuck the landing—the original game feels like it's barely aged a day, while the few additions genuinely enhance the overall experience.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158073/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s first briefly review what’s been changed or tweaked here. In addition to the expected resolution and visual asset sharpening, this rerelease also features a brand new soundtrack, six new optional bosses, a new zone, and rebalanced combat. It’s no comprehensive overhaul, and it debatably isn’t even the best version of the game, but everything new here is welcome and justifies the (low) price tag. All the same, it would’ve been nice to have seen a bit more to round out the package more, as the completely free and still accessible original release offers an experience that’s pretty close to what you can get here.</p>
<p>The narrative in OFF follows a mysterious protagonist named 'The Batter, who traverses a Wonderland-esque world to “purify” various spirits that he believes are a blight on the weird society you explore. If you're expecting a traditional RPG narrative, you won't won’t find one here as OFF is content to pitch you a disorienting, funny, and occasionally scary plot that proves to be quite memorable. Combine this with multiple endings, and you’ve got a story that manages to set itself apart from most of its genre peers, even if its gameplay largely falls in line with them.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158068/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Throughout the game, you guide the Batter and your varying party through dungeons packed with loot, battle weird monsters, solve (very!) esoteric puzzles, and interact with the strange citizens of this dreamlike world. If it were any longer, OFF would feel a bit too simplistic for its own good, but the snappy five-hour runtime ensures the pacing is brisk as you progress through the different zones. The gameplay is quite competent and satisfying, then, even if it feels a bit predictable in its execution.</p>
<p>Combat follows a similar familiar pattern, then, featuring a breezy ATB structure where characters and enemies can make a move once their own action bar fills up. Depending on how you command your crew, you can easily ‘steal’ turns from foes by smartly dispatching or interrupting those whose bar is about to fill. It’s nothing you haven’t seen before, but OFF does a good job of making its encounters feel dynamic without overstaying their welcome. Plus, those of you who cut your teeth on <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> will be pleased to know that combat speed can be increased in this remaster by adjusting a setting in the pause menu, though autobattle from the original release is bizarrely absent here.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158082/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puzzles go quite a bit further than you’d expect in a typical RPG, often testing your observation skills by demanding that you really interact with the world to wring out all the clues you can. Mortis Ghost stated that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/myst">Myst</a> was a big inspiration for the game, and it's noticeably present in the various logic and memory teasers you encounter. Some of these puzzles are a bit frustrating given how obtuse their solutions can be, but it feels <em>great</em> when you finally stumble upon the answer you’ve been chasing for a while.</p>
<p>Visually, OFF goes for a very basic, but effective visual style that highlights the strange and often grotesque enemies designs. There’s a warped, almost Lovecraftian style to many of the spooky specters you face, and OFF loves to throw random photorealistic references into the exaggerated and cartoonish world to keep you wondering what the heck is going on. Beyond these more macabre aspects, the monochromatic world designs and retro-inspired sprite work prove to be competent, if not a bit uninteresting.</p>
<p>One of the more controversial aspects of this release is the soundtrack, which was redone form the ground up due to copyright issues and the original composer, Alias Conrad Coldwood, being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/offthegame/comments/1hmf8gj/i_emailed_acc_asking_about_the_new_soundtrack_in/">cautious of signing contracts around the music</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158076/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The new OST — which has Coldwood's blessing — pulls together tracks from a variety of composers, most famous among them being Undertale and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>’s very own Toby Fox, and the final result is certainly <em>different</em>, but it’s hard to say if it’s better. On one hand, it feels like the somewhat clashing variety of styles on display fits the confusing energy of OFF in a way that the original soundtrack didn’t. On the other hand, there’s something quite distinct about the whispering, lo-fi vibes of the original and its absence here robs OFF of a bit of its quirky charm.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>OFF is a decent remaster of a great game and ultimately stands as a worthy return to this watershed moment in the ‘weird’ side of the indie RPG scene. Its memorable story, engaging combat, and challenging puzzles all combine to make for a brisk and enjoyable RPG adventure that no fan of the genre will want to miss. Even though the additions in this remaster feel a bit minimal, OFF is overall well worth batting for.</p></section>

Before we get into our plans, though, let's recap the week.</p>
<p>It was a pretty quiet one in Nintendo Land, with not so much as a whiff of a Direct — which is weird, after the last three weeks of showcases. Nintendo revealed an all-new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mario-kart-world-announces-summer-vacation-skill-test-event">event in Japan</a>, announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> would soon be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-next-week">arriving on the GameCube NSO library</a> and just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/could-this-mysterious-super-mario-40th-anniversary-x-account-be-legit">maybe set up the social media account</a> for Mario's upcoming 40th anniversary. Oh yes, and we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/first-impressions-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-an-attempt-to-catch-the-hardcore-again">hands-on</a> with a little-known curio called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m knee-deep in yet another fighting game binge, so this weekend will be a mix of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>. I’ve still yet to purchase the latest character pass for Street Fighter 6, but the temptation to play as Sagat is slowly but surely starting to overwhelm. Maybe I’ll cave by Monday, we’ll see. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I polished off the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina</a> demo in one tasty sitting, and have been noodling about with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_seasons">Oracle of Seasons</a> ever since — it's funny how all that GBC inspiration can get you in the mood for... more GBC, isn't it? I also seem to have blinked and somehow racked up a backlog of 2025 games that I'd like to see to before the year is out. Chilling with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> and swooning with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/date_everything">Date Everything!</a> it is, then.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm like Jim has been the past two weeks — in between multiple things but never quite settling on one. UFO 50 is only adding to the problem with its huge 50 game library. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello</a> is amazing, so I'm glad I can dip in and out of that as I please. It'll keep you top-down fans more than occupied until Mina the Hollower arrives.</p>
<p>September and October are <em>stuffed</em> though, so maybe it's a good thing I don't feel like playing much right now. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I've been playing a fair bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ritual_of_raven">Ritual of Raven</a>, a farming-meets-programming game that just came out. It's very interesting! I'll admit that the learning curve is steep, but since I'm learning programming anyway (in Love2D, with Lua) it's basically homework.</p>
<p>I also FINALLYYYYYY completed <strong>PEAK</strong> this week. Got to the top of the mountain after dying 4 times on the way up. Now I just have to do it again, right? Easy...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a> is one of the best Sonic games ever, and while there were hopes it would get a sequel, a few years ago, it was revealed how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/sonic-mania-2-didnt-happen-because-sega-wanted-to-move-beyond-pixel-art">Sega was eager to move beyond pixel art</a> and ultimately it didn't go ahead.</p>
<p>At the time, Sega worked with Headcannon and Christian Whitehead "to consider concepts for the next generation of Classic Sonic", and now, after all this time, Whitehead <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cfwhitehead.bsky.social/post/3lwhbnncp6s2y">has shared concept artwork</a> of what could have been, including a look at the Kanga Clanga Badnik "as it appears in the 2.5D prototype".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is now the 8th anniversary of Mania so time to dig up some Sonic trivia... This year, it's Kanga Clanga! (aka the Kangus). This lovable robo-roo originally lived in the outback but now entertains us all in Pinball Carnival Zone!"</p>

<p>Along with this, Sonic Mania composer Tee Lopes has uploaded a funky 'Outback' beat for "the game that never was":</p>

<p>Sonic Mania was eventually followed up by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, with Whitehead and his studio Evening Star moving onto the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pennys_big_breakaway">Penny's Big Breakaway</a>.</p>

<p>Playable at the World Championships</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> isn't out until October, but this weekend there's a Switch 2 demo at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>The first impressions are now rolling in, and we've put together some thoughts so far – starting with a 'hands on' from our senior video producer Zion Grassl. Although it might not be for everyone, we're thinking the hardcore fans will be pleased with how it's shaping up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"While I’m still trying to temper my excitement and expectations for the overall city exploration, I’m relieved to report the combat, from what I've played, feels like just the thing the series needs to take it into the next generation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186394 @ 1755352037 -->
<p>So, what did other outlets have to say about the demo? Here's what's been said so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview">The Verge:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system... It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of <em>Pokémon</em> games<em>.</em> I’m used to thinking about <em>Pokémon</em> like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in <em>Z-A</em>, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">IGN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can see the potential, but with just twenty minutes of experiencing the early game, it’s much too soon to tell if this real-time battle system will scratch the strategy-itch Pokémon games usually do for me."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-active-battle-mechanics/">Polygon:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat felt fresh, and I was only able to see the beginning of it. I wanted to get right back into another epic battle. I wanted <em>more</em>. And this is all based on a relatively small representation of early-game hours. I can only imagine how much more engaging the combat will feel with a full party of Pokémon, all rocking fleshed-out movesets, as you go up against a formidable foe."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/">VGC:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>" Arceus was a game that brought back so many fans, specifically because it departed from the main series formula, and Z-A is an even bigger departure. It will take much more time with the new battle system to get to grips with the new way of taking down Trainers, but we’re thoroughly sold on Rogue Mega Pokémon battles already."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/">Serebii.net</a></h3>
<p>And to round things off, here's what Serebii.net webmaster Joe Merrick had to say about this demo (<a href="https://youtu.be/8bjZLO8cKyw">via Serebii on YouTube</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's still early, and it's hard to say how well the new systems will work in an overall game, but from what I played here, it seems like it's a cool evolution of the Pokémon Legends formula and it has me wanting to go back and play more, which is a good sign in my view."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This demo is available to the general public at the World Championships this weekend, but you'll need to have registered your interest on Nintendo's website with a Nintendo Account, and it's "first come, first served". You can find out more in our post about this demo:</p>
