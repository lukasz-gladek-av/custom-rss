<p>"They've done an amazing job"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Square Enix had a holiday treat in store for us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrades-free-switch-2-demo-is-now-live">earlier this week,</a> when it dropped the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo on the Switch 2 eShop. Before the full game launches next year, you can now get an idea of what to expect by playing through the iconic opening sequence <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>But how does it hold up from a technical standpoint? Here to answer that very question are the experts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQoWX_Q94vs">Digital Foundry</a>, who have been diving into the demo to see what it can muster.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, DF notes that the Switch 2 <em>is</em> running the 'Intergrade' version of the game (as its name suggests), with all the improved bells and whistles that we previously saw on the PS5 re-release. The frame rate is still at 30fps, mind you, but we knew that already.</p>
<p>On a similarly optimistic note, Digital Foundry describes the HDR implementation as "excellent", with popping highlights and dark zones which don't appear washed out.</p>
<p>In terms of image quality, the game isn't fully comparable to any other console version. The image is a little soft, but "still clear enough", with some dithering weirdness when objects are in motion and across select surfaces. DF puts the Switch 2's approximate internal resolution count at 1080p, stating that it's "really, really beautiful in portable mode".</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like it's holding up really rather well. The DF analysis concludes that the demo is currently "one of the best looking games on Switch 2", though whether that all holds up for the final, much larger version remains to be seen.</p>
<p>That full version will arrive on Switch 2 on 22nd January, and any demo data that you get under your belt until then will carry over to the full release.</p>

<p>Those of you of a certain age will remember <strong>Neopets</strong>. Arriving with a bang in 1999 as a free-to-play virtual browser game where you look after digital pets, it exploded in popularity, spawning merchandise, toys, video games, trading cards, and more. It's still pretty massive today, even!</p>
<p>On the video game side, things have been a little quieter on that front in recent years for console owners, (it's been 20 years since the last home console game), but that changes on <strong>26th</strong> <strong>March 2026</strong> with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/neopets_mega_mini_games_collection">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Acting as a sort of return to the heyday of Neopets, this collection brings together 25 classic Neopets minigames including Turmac Roll, where you roll a little turmac across the ground and collect fruit while avoiding obstacles, and Meerca Chase II, which is a bit like Snake.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still play most of these on a browser, but developer Outright Games has stated that these minigames have been updated with refreshed visuals and more-polished controls.</p>
<p>There's also a brand new minigame in the form of Starlight Symphony, and secret 27th one. DLC, seasonal events, story mode, and online leaderboards (all connected to your Neopets account if you wish) all round out the package.</p>


<p>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection was originally announced back in October 2025, but today's announcement confirms that the game will be available to pre-order on the eShop from15th January 2026.</p>
<p>A Neopets game was rumoured to be coming to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/rumour_neopets_could_be_coming_to_switch">Switch <em>years</em></a> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/rumour_neopets_could_be_coming_to_switch">ago</a></em>, but that never happened. We only had to wait another four years for an actual announcement!</p>
