<p>Yep, jump on over to the search engine to type in the name of either of its young stars, (cheers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/check-out-googles-legend-of-zelda-film-easter-egg-a-nice-reference-to-a-cheeky-meme">Eurogamer</a>) — that's Bo Bragason and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth — and you'll be greeted by a few fun messages at the top of your search results.</p>
<p>We've had a little go, and typing in either of the main stars (of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">ever-so-slightly delayed film</a>) will get you a little emoji and message, with a "well, excuse me princess!" accompanied by a cute little elf emoji for Bo, and Benjamin earning a quite amusing "KYAAAA! HYAAAAA!" when you search for his details, alongside a little dinky Link.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFfvavDRTdA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, as experts on everything Nintendo, you'll all be well aware that these quotes are references to the Legend of Zelda cartoon series, and a nod to the exasperated sounds that Link likes to make when he does anything more strenuous than cook a bird leg. Honestly, how's this guy saving worlds when he's having to roar like that swinging an axe?</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda movie is due to hit cinemas on the 7th May, 2027.</p>

<p>PokéPark Kanto opens in 2026</p>

<p>During today's Pokémon Presents, Chief Creative Fellow at TPC Junichi Masuda showed off aspects of the park (at least, the concept of it). The aim was to create a world where Pokémon actually exist. The park opens in 2026, with tickets going on sale later in 2025.</p>
<p>The park is split into two — a town area, and a forest area. The town itself is like every single little town you've seen in a Pokémon game, complete with a Mart, a Pokémon Center, and places where trainers can gather.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fxtqszo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Pokémon statues will be dotted all across the park in various locations, and they look extremely good — almost like they're real! Well, not quite, but they fit into the environments, anyway.</p>


<p>We'd <em>love</em> to take a visit, but that'll mean taking a trip to the Yomiuriland amusement park in Inagi, Tokyo next year. Better start saving those Poké Dollars!</p>

<p>Just a little longer now...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Whilst we already knew that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, an upcoming battle-focused game for Switch and mobile platforms, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/pokemon-champions-a-new-battle-focused-game-announced-for-switch-and-mobile">was a thing that is happening</a>, extra details have been fairly thin on the ground this far, including when we'll actually get our hands on the game.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a brand new gameplay trailer which was just shown during the latest Pokémon Presents, we have some more info to dig into, most important of which, perhaps, is that the game won't arrive until <strong>2026</strong>. There's no further info on exactly when we can expect a drop, but this is a little longer than we'd expected, given that we've known about the new entry for a little while now.</p>
<p>Outside of a narrowing down of the release window, we also learned a few more positive things about the game itself, including its compatibility with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> - allowing you to transfer your collection of critters from other games into Champions.</p>
<p>You'll be able to fight in Ranked, Casual, or Private Battles and recruit Pokémon to your team using Victory Points.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for yourself above, it's certainly looking action-packed we have to say, and the inclusion of the ability to recruit in-game Pokémon to use in 1v1 and 2v2 battles sounds rather neat indeed.</p>

<p>Lookin' Mega</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Surprising absolutely no one, today's Pokémon Presents showcase left us with yet another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with a lengthy trailer detailing the game's story, side missions and new Mega Evolutions. And yes, there was more than a little Dragonite thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Let's start with that delightful dragon, shall we? The trailer brought us our first proper look at Mega Dragonite, which sports several "Dragonair-like features" — wings on the head, a pearl on the tail, you know the drill. We can't say that we're completely sold on the design, but more Dragonite is always a good thing.</p>
<p>You'll need to rely on newbies like this one to tackle the rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon that are springing up across Lumiose City at their own accord. The trailer gives a closer look at that Xenoblade-style combat that we were so interested in after the reveal, and yep, it still looks cool.</p>


<p>For those who weren't watching the presentation live, TPC split the Legends: Z-A section into two trailers, so you can check out the other half below to find out what the game's story will have in store.</p>

<p>If all of that takes your fancy but you haven't picked up a Switch 2 yet (and you don't want to face the Switch 1 version), Nintendo has revealed that a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-its-very-own-switch-2-bundle">Legends: Z-A Switch 2 bundle</a> will be launching alongside the game on <strong>16th October</strong>.</p>
