<figure data-uuid="39a6170d6ab5b"><a title="The Duskbloods leak" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39a6170d6ab5b/the-duskbloods-leak.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: FromSoftware</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a>, being that it's a FromSoftware joint and all that good stuff, is certainly high on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">our list of things we're very excited about</a> arriving on Switch 2 in the near future. However, given that it's a multiplayer-typed deal in the same vein as the studio's divisive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, we understand that there's a little more trepidation surrounding it, or at least that's how it's felt.</p>
<p>Solo FromSoftware efforts get a big thumbs up very quickly, it seems, but words like 'multiplayer' or even 'online' might make you feel it's not a full-fat adventure from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> studio, perhaps. It's understandable. And yet, according to a new leak surrounding the game (as reported by <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-duskbloods-is-more-innovative-than-elden-ring-according-to-new-leak/">Vice</a>), The Duskbloods has been cooking longer and having more consideration put into it than any of FromSoft's work thus far.</p>
<p>The leak in question comes from a Chinese journalist who gained credibility after leaking correct <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> info before it launched back in 2022. As translated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lHUBWlGTgY">Ziostorm</a>, they report that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From what I know, <em>The Duskbloods</em> was greenlit even earlier than the marketing period for <em>Sekiro’s</em> release. It is the FromSoftware title that has spent the longest time purely on gameplay prototyping and validation among all of their games so far. Although its PVE and PVP, it reportedly contains many innovative elements the team themselves are very proud of.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to claim that the game, which sees Hidetaka Miyazaki on directing duties, lest you forget, could be more influential than the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/sekiro_shadows_die_twice">Sekiro</a> and its great big red mark that it paints on baddies for you. So it seems as though there may well be some big new mechanic at work here that we are yet to find out about as you get down and dirty as one of the game's vampire-flavoured Dusksworn combatants.</p>
<p>You can check out the full quote in Ziostorm's time-stamped video:</p>

<p>As to why it's been so quiet on the news front regarding the game thus far, the same leaker says that all Elden Ring Nightreign DLC will be wrapped up (something which occurs on 7th December) before FromSoftware turn their full attention to revving up their Duskblood engines. Oooh, we're quite excited, actually.</p>
<p>With no confirmed release date beyond "2026", plus not a whole lot of info about the PvPvE online adventure to sink our teeth into <em>and</em> the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/elden-ring-delayed-on-switch-2-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">Switch 2 port of Elden Ring delayed into next year</a>, let's hope we're in for a little pre-Xmas info drop. Or even just a tease. Come on, lads, give us something! Check out the reveal trailer below for a reminder.</p>
