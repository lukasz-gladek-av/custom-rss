<p>Capcom has released a new teaser trailer for Alex, the latest addition in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There's no raw gameplay here, but if you ever wanted to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a>'s Andore (Hugo) get beaten to a pulp, this trailer has you covered. Alex fully turns heel for this one, becoming 'The Man With No Allies' as he taunts his opponent and rebukes the crowd.</p>
<p>From this short teaser, we're not overly keen on Alex's look, but it's at least much, <em>much</em> better than his appearance in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a>. Jesus, that was <a href="https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/as/common/character/bustup/l/alx.png?h=eb260947df38fcec30440acb79613441">rough</a>.</p>
<p>As for when fans will finally get to play as Alex, there's no firm release date, but the trailer ends to confirm that he'll be available in 'Early Spring'. So we're potentially looking at a release in March, perhaps.</p>
<p>Alex will join Sagat and C. Viper in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass, with Ingrid making her mainline series debut at some point in the future.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> for Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2, we said it's "crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped", awarding it a score of 9/10. It also featured as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">one of our personal Game of the Year choices</a> for 2025, so do check that out if you have a moment.</p>

<p>According to the latest Dragami Games press release, it will be launching in this location on <strong>26th March 2026</strong> (this includes a physical release). Switch users who already own the game will be able to purchase the "Upgrade Pack" in this region for 1,100 yen (about $7).</p>
<p>This version will include graphical enhancements apparently "not possible" in the Switch version of the game. The game's performance has also been "significantly improved" and it now runs at a "stable 60fps in both handheld and docked".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xuqvol&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>There'll also be some new content in the Switch 2 Edition, including an exclusive arcade-style mode where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret. Joy-Con 2 mouse support will also offer a "fresh and distinct control experience".</p>
<p>Outside of Japan, this upgrade is currently scheduled for an "early 2026" release on the Switch 2. When we get an update about the local release, we'll let you know.</p>
