<p>Darwin's evolution</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this year, in Sony's February State of Play, Konami revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darwins_paradox">Darwin's Paradox!</a>, an octopus platformer with more than a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Inside</a>-esque stealth gameplay under the hood. A Switch 1 version was announced at the time, but a new trailer suggests that things might have made the jump entirely to Switch 2.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 icon at the end of the reveal trailer has been solely replaced by its Switch 2 counterpart in the new footage, accompanied by a <strong>2026</strong> release window.</p>
<p>So, the old hardware might be missing out, but the new trailer has got its tentacles around us, all the same. The Inside vibes are still present and correct, as Darwin the octopus stealthily completes platforming puzzles while avoiding the gaze of creepy, dystopian scenes in the background.</p>
<p>There are abilities like flying when filled with hot air, or twanging across large gaps that make things look a little more family-friendly than Playdead's depressing affair, but we sense there'll be a decent number of chills along the way, too.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screens from the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/darwins_paradox/">Konami website</a>, so you can get an idea of the dread under the colourful surface:</p>

<p>Alongside the new gameplay trailer, Konami has also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emK1N6GWvIU">Darwin's Paradox dev deepdive</a> with some of the team from ZDT Studio, which delves into the game's inspirations and stealthy protagonist.</p>
<p>So yes, the Switch 1 version may be dead in the water, but we'll be excited to check this one out on Switch 2 — hopefully with some improved specs to boot — at some point in 2026.</p>

<p>Indeed, while we heaped praise on the game for its excellent interactive documentary and wide selection of games in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">7/10 review</a>, we noted that the online functionality is simply not up to scratch at the moment. Additionally, an issue in which lowering the in-game difficulty setting doesn't provide adequate respite for players struggling against the AI <a href="https://x.com/frostman007/status/1984113281607651706">has also been acknowledged by developer Digital Eclipse</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, this latter issue appears to be so prevalent that some players over on PS5 have actually been awarded full refunds from Sony (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/sonys-allowing-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-refunds-because-the-ps5-ps4-compilation-is-a-downright-nightmare-for-some">Push Square</a>). A Reddit post from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Natural_Parsnip_5291/">Natural_Parsnip_5291</a> stated that "the AI input reading is a downright nightmare".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067joizgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Digital Eclipse is, however, working incredibly hard to resolve the issues that have arisen since launch. In fact, Head of Production Stephen Frost has been remarkably communicative over on X regarding player grievances, and recently stated that he is "running on fumes" in attempting to respond to all of the complaints.</p>

<p>The company has, however, confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-update-announced-here-are-the-patch-notes">a patch is already available on Steam</a>, with fixes addressing audio issues when playing online, missing audio from the 32X version of MKII, and more general stability. This patch is due to release on console at any moment.</p>
<p>Stephen Frost has also stated that more patches are due to go into testing imminently, so it seems crystal clear that the team is razor-focused on improving Legacy Kollection for players on all platforms. If you're not keen on diving in right now, we'd advise keeping your eye out for future updates – we're confident Digital Eclipse can stabilise things.</p>

<figure data-uuid="0c2e0ba680b7e"><a title="Sonic" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c2e0ba680b7e/sonic.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega has released updated sales figures for both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/ir_2025_web_all_low_en_.pdf">integrated report for 2025</a>.</p>
<p>As we'd expected, Sonic Frontiers is ahead of Superstars, likely due in part to the simple fact that it released much sooner, but we also believe that folks are generally more receptive to fully 3D titles these days. Indeed, Sega has previously stated that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/sega-reports-sluggish-sales-of-sonic-superstars-and-other-major-titles">sales for Superstars were "sluggish"</a>.</p>
<p>As for the specific figures, Sonic Frontiers sits at <strong>4.57 million units</strong>, while Sonic Superstars has shifted <strong>2.43 million units</strong>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is, for some reason, completely absent.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067joizgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>We unfortunately don't get a look at what the platform split is for the sales data, but something tells us that the Switch is probably up there as the most popular console; at the very least, it'll be second to the PS5.</p>
<p>All in all, these certainly aren't bad figures, but it definitely puts into perspective that Nintendo's recent performance with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. The game, which launched back in July, has already shifted 3.49 million units, which compared to Frontiers and Superstars is kind of astonishing.</p>
<p>Still, we have nothing but love for the blue blur (even if we weren't particularly fond of Frontiers), so we hope Sega can shift even more units going forward. For racing fans, the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> will also be released soon, so keep your eye out for that.</p>

<p>All in all, there's not a whole lot to report on with the OG Switch. The numbers are all gradually going up, but there are no changes to the overall order. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is just shy of 70 million units sold now, so we fully expect the game to hit this for the next financial release.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> has bumped itself over the 22 million mark, which is a fantastic achievement for a sequel. You might wonder, in fact, why both this and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> didn't see an even bigger jump, considering both received Switch 2 Editions. Well, the reason is simple: Nintendo has stated that Upgrade Packs don't count toward total software sales, so there you go.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067joizgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Only 10,000 units separate it from the DS</p>

<figure data-uuid="104c3f1734b63"><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/104c3f1734b63/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been positively <em>itching</em> to see the latest financial report from Nintendo, as we had expected the Switch to finally surpass the Nintendo DS and become the company's best-selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Alas, that hasn't quite happened yet. At <strong>154.01 million units</strong>, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Switch is a mere 10,000 units away from the DS</a>, and considering the data is only viable to the end of September 2025, it's likely that the gap has already been closed in the couple of months following.</p>
<p>We don't <em>know</em> that though, so we just have to assume for now that the DS is still in the lead.</p>
<p>Still, what a remarkable feat by the Switch! And let's not forget that the console commands the most software sales by a <em>huge</em> margin, shifting a total of <strong>1,452.79 million units</strong>. DS, meanwhile, managed <strong>948.76 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the Switch 2, which has now sold a total of <strong>10.36 million units</strong> after just 4 months on the market, it's only 3.2 million units away from surpassing the Wii U - <em>mad</em>.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at where things stand at the moment:</p>

<figure data-uuid="9cd0e499927a1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cd0e499927a1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">financial data</a> for the six months ending <strong>30th September 2025</strong>, and has provided updated sales figures for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The console has now sold at least <strong>10.36 million units</strong> according to the official figures, which is seemingly more than even Nintendo itself was anticipating. As such, the company has increased its forecast for the year, bumping expected Switch 2 sales up from <strong>15 million</strong> to <strong>19 million</strong>. Switch 2 software has seen a similar jump up from <strong>45 million</strong> to <strong>48 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Naturally, this also means that sales for the original Switch family of systems have tanked, with the console pulling in a meagre <strong>1.89 million</strong> in sales, a hefty drop of 60% year-on-year. As a result, Nintendo has decreased its forecast for the Switch accordingly, lowering console sales from <strong>4.5 million</strong> to <strong>4 million</strong>. On the flip side, however, thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility, the software forecast has been increased from <strong>105 million</strong> to <strong>125 million;</strong> a bump of 19%.</p>
<p>Here's a look at how the Switch 2 has sold across various regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Americas - 3.68m</li>
<li>Europe - 2.40m</li>
<li>Japan - 2.35m</li>
<li>Other - 1.93m</li>
</ul>
<p>With the help of bundles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has also sold an extraordinary amount, shifting a total of <strong>9.57 million</strong> <strong>units</strong> since launch – a remarkable attach rate of over 92%. Meanwhile, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold <strong>3.49 million units</strong>, which perhaps isn't as high as fans would have hoped for. Still, it's a good start nevertheless.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that a total of <strong>20.62 million software units</strong> for the Switch 2 have been sold since launch, of which approximately <strong>8.10 million</strong> were bundled with the console itself.</p>
<p>A pretty solid start for the Switch 2, then! As expected, this also means that gross profit also saw a nice little bump for the company, "rising 25.3% year-on-year to 398.4 billion yen". It's also increased its financial forecasts for the year, including net sales to 2,250.0 billion yen and operating profit to 370.0 billion yen.</p>
