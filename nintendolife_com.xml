There we are just trying to enjoy our day, when all of a sudden, <em>BOOM</em>, we're reminded that today is the 15th anniversary of the 3DS.</p>
<p>Yes, the 3DS, that console which, in our minds, is still a relatively young whippersnapper, was released on this day (26th February) <em>fifteen years ago</em> in 2011.</p>
<p>It's a system that many of us here at Nintendo Life still hold dearly in our hearts, and one that we return to with a surprising frequency, even though we've got <em>two</em> newer consoles from the House of Mario at our disposal. But there's something about the software lineup that we just can't knock. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a>?

<p>But we're not here to discuss the software this time (we've got our list of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/50-best-nintendo-3ds-games-of-all-time">50 Best 3DS Games Of All Time</a> for that), we want to talk about the system itself. More specifically, we want to talk about its weird and wonderful family.</p>
<p>Because yes, while the 3DS is a system in its own right, it spawned a whole family of models to choose between. These were released every couple of years between 2011 and 2017, and included everything from bigger screens to additional control stick 'nubs'.</p>
<p>As the OG system celebrates a decade and a half since launch, we thought it'd be only right to remind you about each model's quirks before we pit them head-to-head in a poll to decide, conclusively, which one is the best (or which one is your favourite, at the very least).</p>
<p>So, here they all are, in release order.</p>
<h2>3DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="322f2411bfd81"><a title="3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/322f2411bfd81/3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 26th February 2011</p>
<p>The first model really was a beauty, wasn't it? The big selling point was that autostereoscopic 3D screen, of course, but let's not forget the internal and external cameras for all of those free AR games, a particularly slippery circle pad, and the trio of Select / Home / Start buttons that never <em>really</em> felt like buttons. <em>Magical</em>.</p>
<h2>3DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="fa6500028ef05"><a title="3DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa6500028ef05/3ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 28th July 2012</p>
<p>Do it again... but bigger. Just a year and a half after the 3DS first appeared on the market, Nintendo launched the XL model. It had all the same features as its predecessor, but with a 124mm screen, compared to the old model's 90mm.</p>
<h2>2DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="273f5b0adf4de"><a title="2DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/273f5b0adf4de/2ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released</strong>: 12th October 2013</p>
<p>Another year, another 3DS. Only, this one <em>wasn't</em> 3D. Aside from being the ugliest-looking handheld Nintendo had released in a hot minute, the 2DS removed the family's trademark gimmick (and its internal stereo speakers) for a cheaper, <em>non</em>-autostereoscopic model.</p>
<p>A lot of people didn't get on with the 3D, so its removal is fair enough. The removal of the clamshell design, however, is a little harder to overlook.</p>

<h2>New Nintendo 3DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4738e1324284a"><a title="New Nintendo 3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4738e1324284a/new-nintendo-3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 25th October 2014</p>
<p>The 'New' model felt like a big step up. This boasted all the same features as the OG system, but with a bunch of fresh bells and whistles thrown in to improve the play experience. We're talking face tracking for an improved 3D effect, automatic screen brightness adjustment, longer battery life, bonus ZL/ZR buttons, a 'C-stick' nub, amiibo support... the list goes on.</p>
<p>Throw in a more powerful processor, swappable faceplates, some exclusive games, and Virtual Console titles, and Nintendo was onto a winner of an upgrade.</p>

<h2>New Nintendo 3DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6a7e526be8b13"><a title="New Nintendo 3DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6a7e526be8b13/new-nintendo-3ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 11th October 2014</p>
<p>Launching in the same window as the smaller 'New' option, this model packed in all of the features outlined above, but, once again, with a 124mm screen to boot.</p>
<h2>New Nintendo 2DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="eff0fdb60e904"><a title="New Nintendo 2DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eff0fdb60e904/new-nintendo-2ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 15th June 2017</p>
<p>The final member of the 3DS family actually launched after the Switch generation was already up and running. This model supported many of the same features as its 'New XL' counterpart, but with a new home button (shifted to the left of the screen), an updated SD Card and cartridge placement at the front of the system's base, and a little cart cover, vaguely reminiscent of the Switch. Naturally, this one dropped the 3D option, too.</p>
