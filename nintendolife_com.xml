<figure><a title="Miyamoto - Super Nintendo World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca4def15ef96e/miyamoto-super-nintendo-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>During Nintendo's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">shareholder Q&amp;A meeting</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto stressed the importance for developers to "work for the consumer, not your boss", ensuring that teams can produce games that will satisfy players.</p>
<p>Afterwards, ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura added his own two cents to the conversation and stated that Miyamoto has always viewed games as "products", not "works of art", and believes that his background studying industrial art helped shaped this viewpoint (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shigeru-miyamotos-background-in-industrial-design-explains-his-pragmatic-product-not-art-approach-to-making-games-nintendo-veteran-says/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Miyamoto studied industrial design at an art university, and he views games as ‘products,’ not ‘works of art.’ I think this perspective is what leads to game development that’s more aligned with the user.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it's not clear from the quote, Imamura doesn't believe Miyamoto's view of games to be a negative one. Instead, it helps to ensure that game development is done in service of the player, ensuring that the final product is one of exceptional high quality.</p>
<p>The discussion over whether game development can be viewed as an art form has been ongoing for many years, and we believe that yes, it absolutely <em>is</em> an art form. But it's one that customers are ultimately paying good money to experience, and we don't necessarily believe it's wrong, therefore, to also view them as products.</p>
<p>Hey, if it helps make sure they're consistently great, then we're all for it.</p>

<p>It's super effective!</p>

<figure><a title="Popplio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c2867edeea91/popplio.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's not every day that you get to meet The Pope, but one Pokémon fan decided to make the most of his recent trip to The Vatican on 5th July.</p>
<p>Reddit user ReptileCake took two Pokémon cards with him when meeting Pope Leo (real name Robert Francis Prevost): one to get blessed, and one to get signed. But why? Why Pokémon cards, specifically? Well, the Pokémon in question is Popplio!</p>
<p>Get it..? Popplio. Pope Leo. Guffaw!</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fan-meets-pope-leo-gets-him-to-sign-a-popplio-pokemon-trading-card-and-it-looks-like-the-pontiff-got-the-joke?utm_source=campaigner&amp;utm_campaign=NL_FIX_July_08_2025&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;Ictg=45858995214">IGN</a>, ReptileCake said that Pope Leo took the whole thing in his stride and clearly understood the reference, happily signing the card in question:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkzywlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was pretty chill. We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p>
<p>"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the card immediately gaining a significant amount of worth, ReptileCake says that he has no intention of selling it on, stating that Pope Leo agreeing to sign the card is "worth more than any monetary value can satisfy", and that it is now "a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity".</p>
<figure><a title="Popplio Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2a715c1ebbfd/popplio-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fa-man-got-his-popplio-pok%25C3%25A9mon-card-autographed-by-pope-leo-v0-h3y8oua088bf1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3024%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D07843c370d3f5870f9ecff1477731b2a235f6796">ReptileCake</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So there you have it! Quite a wholesome little incident, all told. Though we imagine this will kickstart a rather concerning trend in which fans flock to the Vatican to get their own Pokémon cards signed.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ball game for scalpers, huh?</p>
