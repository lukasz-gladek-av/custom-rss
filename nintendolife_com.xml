<p>"It's been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios' CEO Stephen Kick has once again reiterated his desire to remaster <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a> (or at the very least see <em>some</em> sort of rerelease), originally released on the GameCube in 2002.</p>
<p>If you remember back in 2022, Kick posted on social media to state that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/nightdive-studios-wants-to-remaster-titles-like-eternal-darkness-but-hasnt-had-any-luck-with-nintendo">Nightdive had been involved in discussions with Nintendo</a> about remastered some of its games, but noted that the company was "gun shy" about working with third-party developers. He followed up by saying that "Eternal Darkness is #1 on my list".</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview with Shacknews, Kick once again mentioned Eternal Darkness as one of the games high up on his so-called 'bucket list' of titles to remaster. At the very top is the 2000 FPS title <strong>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</strong> from Monolith Productions; a game that may well prove difficult to revisit thanks to complications around the IP rights.</p>
<p>Here's what Kick said about Eternal Darkness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I will say that there's another game really high on that list, and that would have to be Eternal Darkness. It's been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time, and it's something that I would personally love to see get rereleased."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nightdive's next release for the Switch is a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a>, originally released in 1997 and built on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_dark_forces_remaster">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a>' Jedi engine. It's currently scheduled to launch on. <strong>20th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Prologue demo also announced</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Falcom and GungHo have today confirmed the upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> will be getting a Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>This particular version will be a digital release and includes higher resolution and frame rate "for sharper" and "smoother graphics", along with reduced load times. This is part of a paid upgrade path for existing Switch owners and is priced at <strong>$1.00 USD</strong> (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2dcd98f04fd51/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>As you can see in the fine print above, to "play Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you must purchase the paid Upgrade Pack" and this "Upgrade Pack alone" does not give you access to the full game. A standard physical release will be available for the Switch as well as a 'SteelBook' and 'Bracer Edition'.</p>
<p>Along with this news, a <a href="https://trailsfirstchapter.com/trial/">prologue demo has also been revealed for Switch</a> and other platforms. Players will be able to carry over their save data to the full version, when it arrives next month on <strong>19th September 2025</strong>. The demo is now live in Japan.</p>

<p>After a restart, delays and an incredibly long wait, it appears Retro Studios' anticipated release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> may have <em>finally</em> been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.</p>
<p>A rating has recently been spotted on Nintendo's website in the US, taking it from "Rating Pending" to a 'T' for "Teen" classification.</p>
<p>The currently attached description on the same page references animated blood and violence. As noted by <a href="https://shinesparkers.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-what-it-means/">Metroid fan site Shinesparkers</a>, this age rating would be consistent with the main <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> games <em>before</em> the fourth entry.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here is ESRB's basic summary of this age rating, describing what a game under this classification may contain. The guide on its <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">website also goes into detail</a> about "interactive elements" referenced by the rating above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Teen - content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ratings for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, 2 and 3 in this same region contained "animated blood" and "violence". The classification and "rating summary" for Beyond has not gone live on ESRB's official website yet, so if there are any changes or updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This discovery follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rating-spotted-fuelling-nintendo-direct-hopes-again">game being rated in South Korea</a> by the Game Rating and Administration Committee in July, so hopefully, all this recent activity means an official release date isn't too far away. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently targeting a <strong>2025</strong> launch and the Switch 2 version will include enhanced resolution and frame rate as well as Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lineup of games for the remainder of this year is already looking quite busy, with the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> game scheduled for October and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> now locked in for November.</p>
