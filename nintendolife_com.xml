<p>The old "platform expansion", eh?</p>

<figure data-uuid="955cbbc138351"><a title="Stellar Blade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/955cbbc138351/stellar-blade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen several ports come our way in the last eight months that would have been nothing more than a pipedream on Switch 1, and it looks like another title that got everyone talking on PS5 back in 2024 might make the jump to the new Nintendo hybrid, too.</p>
<p>We're talking about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, of course, the action-adventure title from Sony Interactive Entertainment and Shift Up. In the developer's latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">financial report</a>, the team discussed what it hopes to see the game achieve in 2026, noting, "We are reviewing platform expansion beyond PS5 and PC to broaden audience reach. This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series".</p>
<p>Now, okay, there's no specific mention of Switch 2 in there, and the platform expansion is merely being <em>reviewed</em> at the moment, but if it's audience reach that Shift Up is after, we struggle to think of a better destination than Nintendo's latest.</p>
<p>"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," the note concludes.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade enjoyed PS5 exclusivity for the best part of a year before the PC version was released in June 2025. With its sequel now in development, it makes sense that the team would want to broaden its reach to attract as big an audience as possible, it just remains to be seen whether Switch 2 or a straight-up Xbox Series port is the way to do it.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more info this year, and will keep you updated with any juicy Switch 2 nuggets.</p>

<figure data-uuid="347d15142edfd"><a title="Switch and Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/347d15142edfd/switch-and-switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It was back in 2024 that Nintendo really kicked its emulator takedown requests into overdrive following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/switch-emulator-yuzu-to-pay-usd2-4-million-to-nintendo-and-cease-development">removal of Yuzu and 3DS emulator Citra</a>, and a fresh wave came late last week.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/switch_emulators_got_hit_with_dmca_notice/">Reddit</a> user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Devile/">Devile</a>, Nintendo issued a new DMCA notice on Friday calling for the removal of 13 Switch emulators' GitHub pages. Alongside any that still rely on Yuzu, the takedown targeted Citron, Eden, Kenji-NX, MeloNX, Pine, Pomelo, Ryubing, Ryujinx, Skyline, Sudachi, Sumi, and Suyu (the one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/creators-of-new-switch-emulator-suyu-hope-to-avoid-nintendos-wrath">formed in Yuzu's wake</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8ghkzxl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As with previous takedowns, Nintendo cites the circumvention of its technological protection measures (TPMs) as grounds for removal.</p>
<p>"Nintendo Switch emulators are primarily designed to play Nintendo Switch games. Specifically, these Nintendo Switch emulators illegally circumvent Nintendo’s TPMs and run illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games," the notice reads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, they are primarily designed to and unlawfully "circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under"the DMCA, and distribution of these emulators constitutes unlawful trafficking in technology that is "primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access" to copyrighted works."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, not every emulator outlined is ready to pack up just yet. As noted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-once-again-brings-dmca-hammer-down-switch-emulators/">wccftech</a>, one of the project managers behind Switch emulator Eden took to its dedicated Discord channel on Friday to note, "Our source code is unaffected, as it isn't hosted on GitHub. The only thing targeted was our GitHub releases page".</p>
<p>According to the post, Eden seems confident that its emulator source code will remain available, despite the GitHub takedown. "Our development will continue as always," the message concludes.</p>
<p>In a message to wccftech, Eden founder Camille LaVey said, "We want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware". While LaVey didn't specify whether the goal was to keep running the emulator even if the GitHub page was removed, he hoped that "Eden can still be alive for the years to come" if the community stays on board.</p>

            <guid>1437223</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162023/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>It feels like just yesterday that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> slashed its way onto the Switch to deliver another one of the series’ action-packed adventures for the ages — and, really, that’s not too far off the mark. The 10th mainline entry in NIS’ seminal RPG franchise made its way westward back in late 2024, which is still plenty recent enough for it to remain fresh in the minds of players and established fans. However, that hasn’t stopped NIS from forging right ahead with the global launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> on Switch 2 just a year and change later.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, this is an expanded re-release of the original Ys X: Nordics with a bevvy of additional quality-of-life features, enhancements, and gameplay scenarios. I’ll cut to the chase: nearly every addition in this enhanced version is a win, all but eliminating common grievances from the base game and tossing in a bunch of new features that make it far and away the definitive way to experience Ys X.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162025/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I’m not sure if anyone who recently dropped a bag of gold on the original will be swayed by what this release has in store.</p>
<p>Just like the base game, Proud Nordics focuses on two leads: recurring series protagonist and fanatical adventurer Adol Christin and Norman warrior princess Karja Balta. Mysterious forces (quite literally) bind this unlikely duo together before an unexpected catastrophe sends the pair scrambling across the Norse-inspired Obelia Gulf to defeat the undead forces of the Griegr.</p>
<p>Gameplay sees you controlling both Adol and Karja to explore the realm, engaging in real-time combat with an array of monsters, and even piloting your very own pirate ship across the sea.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162028/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additions aside, Proud Nordics is as much of a blast to play as the original. The combat is great fun, maintaining a straightforward slash-block-and-dodge system while also letting you simultaneously control both protagonists on the fly to pull off devastating attacks via Duo Mode. The game’s RPG systems are all polished to a fine sheen, with a ton of different ways to customise your stats and movesets for both your protagonists and your ship.</p>
<p>Traversing Obelia Gulf brings me right back to the good old days of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, with oodles of treasures, side quests, and hidden lore drops littered across the map. The story bridging everything together is no slouch either — not groundbreaking by any means, but compelling in its own right with plenty of emotional beats further elevated by an excellent English voice dub.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ys-x-nordics">Mitch reviewed Ys X: Nordics on Switch 1</a>, some of his key issues centred around the tedious nature of sailing, as well as the game’s performance and visual fidelity. I’m happy to report that this updated version takes pretty major strides in addressing both of these areas.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162027/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Obelia Gulf now features a vast swath of wind currents, which the Sandras can ride to quickly sail between locations. It’s not a perfect fix for those who were frustrated by bouts of sluggish sailing in the original game — many currents must first be unlocked via brief naval skirmishes and there are still plenty of points on the map where you can only rely on your ship’s innate abilities — but this change goes a long way in reducing downtime for map traversal.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more critical to the moment-to-moment gameplay experience, however, is the massive bump in performance and graphical quality that Proud Nordics offers over the original. Back on Switch, Ys X often struggled to hit its 30fps target and the resolution could get pretty fuzzy. The strain on the ageing hardware was obvious, but Proud Nordics on Switch 2 feels like the game has traded in tight working boots for a nice, roomy pair of slippers.</p>
<p>In addition to retouched graphics, it now features options for Quality and Performance modes. Quality Mode bumps up the resolution tremendously while keeping things running at a stable 60fps. However, Performance Mode is the real star of the show here, with a solid resolution of its own and a deliciously smooth 120fps target.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162024/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Action RPGs live and die by their game feel, and this refreshed version of Ys X brings a level of responsiveness that makes the simple act of picking up the controller and hitting a few buttons an amazing experience. The only remaining issues I noticed are strictly in the visuals department, as some textures in the game still look rather flat and enemies have an odd penchant for moving at a lower frame rate in handheld mode. All told, these are only minor problems that didn’t impact my overall enjoyment.</p>
<p>Enhancements and quality-of-life features are just half of what Proud Nordics brings to the table. The most substantial addition to the game itself is the newly explorable Öland Island, which brings with it an extra side story, a host of extra dungeons to explore, and a new Mana Action to add to your mystical arsenal.</p>
<p>This large landmass houses previously unrevealed truths about the history of the Norman people while also introducing two new characters, Canute and Astrid, a pair of Shield Brethren with a surprising connection to Karja’s past. The narrative, which sees the game’s heroes in a race with Canute to discover the island’s secrets, may not be a game-changer, but it does a great job of further fleshing out Karja in particular.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162026/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>More parts of Öland Island become accessible as you progress through the main story, encouraging you to come back every so often. Progression also requires use of Mana Hold, a new Mana Action that allows you to pick up select objects and fling them forward for use as platforms or projectiles.</p>
<p>Considering how tactile and fun to use many of the base game’s Mana Actions are, I was disappointed by how finicky Mana Hold is by comparison. Aiming is far more complicated than it should be due to awkward camera angles, and the blocks you launch tend to spin arbitrarily or phase through the environment where you can no longer reach them. Couple these issues with the fact that Mana Hold is essentially locked to exclusive use on Öland Island, and it feels pretty underwhelming.</p>
<p>Beyond the new story scenario on Öland Island, there are a fair few other things to do. Astrid hosts the Coliseum, where you can rematch powerful foes for time-based rewards. Meanwhile, the new postgame dungeon Muspelheim challenges you to battle against ultra-strong enemies and avoid traps to reach the end within a strict time limit. Repeated runs net you rewards that allow you to lessen the dungeon’s difficulty in a variety of ways, injecting the core gameplay loop with a decidedly roguelite flavour.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162022/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the breezier side of things, you can also now participate in a couple of new Gullinboard races for performance-based prizes — a major win for those who, like me, could not get enough of the breakneck land surfing action in the main game.</p>
<p>While all of Proud Nordics’ new experiences are certainly welcome additions to the overall Ys X experience and do a particularly effective job at expanding the postgame, I can’t help but feel that a lot of what’s exclusively on offer here feels just a tad superfluous. The new stuff is perfectly good, but Ys X was already crammed so full of things to do both on and off the beaten path that most of what’s added here feels like just another layer of icing on a delicious cake — it’s nice to have, but that bite is going to taste almost the exact same as before.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162029/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyone who already had their fill with the original Nordics may be too full to go back for seconds, and it leaves me wondering whether Proud Nordics would have been better suited as a Switch 2 enhancement patch and further DLC packs for the original game rather than a standalone release.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It may have all the same bones as the original version, but Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 is undoubtedly the way that this landmark action-adventure title deserves to be experienced on Nintendo hardware. Not only are the visuals improved, but the major performance bump makes everything from striking down enemies to simply navigating menus an absolute joy.</p>
<p>The new gameplay additions, ranging from new story scenarios to tough-as-nails dungeon crawling, are nice to have as well, even if they ultimately feel like a small speck awash in the sea of gameplay variety that Ys X already contained. This enhanced version's siren song may be too faint to lure back anyone who forged through the original release, but newcomers and prospective fans owe it to themselves to answer the call and embark on the definitive version of this grand adventure.</p></section>
