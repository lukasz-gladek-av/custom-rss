<p>Happy Hollowdays</p>

<figure><a title="Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2088611c25fb5/silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>The day is finally upon us! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> arrives on the Switch 2 (and Switch 1, have no fear) in just a few hours, with Team Cherry doing a global drop later on today.</p>
<p>Now, there's no eShop page currently live, nor are there any pre-order options for this one, so if you want to dive into the hotly anticipated sequel as early as you possibly can, you'll want to be there at drop time. Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry revealed the release times in a handful of regions, but we thought it was only right to recap 'em all for you now, so you don't miss out on any valuable metroidvania minutes. You'll find the exact time Silksong launches in your region below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jinzmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game will set you back <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> (there's no GBP price info available at the time of writing, but we have to imagine it'll be £19.99 too), and there's even a free upgrade path to the Switch 2 version of the game if you decide to pick up the S1 edition today.</p>
<p>And we'll be diving right in with you. Team Cherry confirmed that it wouldn't be sending our pre-launch codes, so we'll be setting out on our underground adventure today and will endeavour to have our review with you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>New features, but no game update</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Switch Online's 'Nintendo Classics' library has this week been expanded with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a> and the Japan-only release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a>. Although the GBA title hasn't been made available locally, the app here has received an update, bumping it up to Version 3.0.0.</p>
<p>Firstly, the official banner and icon for this app have been updated – swapping out the 'Switch Online' branding for 'Nintendo Classics'. Apart from this, there's <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-classics-switch-online-gba-app-adds-new-functionality/">reportedly been some added "functionality"</a> including button remapping options along with 1080p support in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>
<p>An easter egg has also been added to the start up screen. If you hold the left analogue stick when starting the app, the original GBA boot up screen will appear (<a href="https://www.vooks.net/game-boy-advance-boot-screen-easter-egg-add-to-switch-nintendo-classics-app/">here's a look via Vooks.net</a>).</p>
<p>Since the release of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has updated its other Switch Online retro apps with new features, improved filters and additional games. Nintendo highlighted the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/icymi-nintendo-highlights-super-nes-nintendo-classics-features-update">updates to its SNES app</a> in a new video last week, including mouse support for multiple titles.</p>

<p>One issue was tied to the game's resolution not being properly optimised. Fortunately, it looks like SEGA has taken player feedback on board, with the company's official Japanese social media account revealing there'll be a patch to address this. Here's the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy Shinobi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, this patch is on the way for the Switch version, so hopefully players won't have to wait much longer. Apart from the game's resolution, in our review build, we encountered some frame rate issues.</p>

Plus, there will be a new Companion, Sidekick, and more to enjoy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update also includes an "earnable avatar" Classic Rayman, a Murfy Companion (who will join you in battle and react to the events of the match), and a Forest Dragon Sidekick. There are also new themed emojis and more.</p>
