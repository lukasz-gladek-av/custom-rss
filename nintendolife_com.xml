<p>Just remove the red lens cover</p>

<p>Yesterday, Nintendo shared an update about its Virtual Boy library coming to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack next month.</p>
<p>Although it seemingly doubles down on the requirement to purchase new headsets, on a more welcoming note, there will be some quality-of-life enhancements. Apart from the usual options, including save states, the ability to rewind gameplay and remap controls - in case you missed it, there'll also be the option to change the colour of the screen.</p>
<p>Yes, users will actually be able to remove the red lens and swap to the following colours to make the whole experience a little easier on the eyes:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f5a3e167c969d"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f5a3e167c969d/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="5fcd40fbe7241"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fcd40fbe7241/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="d98c622b1157a"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d98c622b1157a/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one downside is that this colour change option <em>won't</em> actually be available at launch next month. According to Nintendo, it will be coming "later this year", so you'll just have to wait! Once again, this new feature will require users to physically "remove the lens cover" from the headset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> delivered an excellent Switch 2 port last July, and if you were hoping for the next entry on Nintendo's new hybrid system, it seems you're in luck.</p>
<p>According to Dealabs' Billbil-kun, who has accurately reported on game announcements ahead of schedule in the past, the next WWE 2K will not only be coming to the Switch 2, but it will also be arriving on the same date as the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 counterparts.</p>
<p>The current date for <strong>WWE 2K26</strong>'s launch is apparently scheduled to take place on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>, with pre-orders expected to open this week, so we'll provide an update if we hear anything. The source has also shared some details about the physical copy of the game, claiming it will be another "code-in-box release", much like last year's entry.</p>
<p>When we find out more, we'll let you know. In some <em>other</em> sports-related news, it seems the next chapter in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_26">MLB The Show</a> series will actually be skipping the Switch 2, as Sony sticks with a Switch release for now.</p>

<p>To hell with these bugs</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4e1835aa8e7a7"><a title="DOOM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e1835aa8e7a7/doom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo and developers have been working to make as many Switch games as possible compatible with the new system.</p>
<p>One of the many titles that has experienced issues on this hybrid device is Bethesda's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a> reboot, which launched in 2016 and eventually made its way to the Switch in 2017 with the help of the talented team at Panic Button.</p>
<p>Although issues with the title on the Switch 2 were thought to have been resolved in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/more-switch-games-receive-compatibility-updates-for-switch-2">compatibility update last November</a>, it appears there are still some problems to iron out. While the title is now officially "supported" in terms of Switch 2 compatibility, according to Nintendo, the "game behaviour may vary from Nintendo Switch".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067orhytl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The update posted on Nintendo's compatibility site earlier this week on 27th January 2026 mentions how "the game sometimes force closes after autosaving at specific points". For now, it's simply a matter of reopening the title when this happens and to continue playing using the same save data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b83d434af1971"><a title="DOOM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b83d434af1971/doom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, it's not a major problem, but it's something that's being investigated and will hopefully be resolved sooner rather later. Despite this issue when playing DOOM on the Switch 2, this title, in general, is still a hell of a shooter and a fantastic port from Panic Button.</p>
