<p>But what could it mean?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a surprise new short film called '<strong>Close To You</strong>' and it's... not what we expected from the House of Mario.</p>
<p>Initially shared on the Nintendo Today! app before cropping up on YouTube and socials, the short follows a baby that learns to take its first steps via the magic of a sentient dummy (or pacifier, if you'd rather).</p>
<p>It feels very Toy Story, and the animation style has big Pixar energy to boot, but the strangest part of it all is how it feels very... un-Nintendo. There's no Mario to seen, the baby doesn't stumble past some Joy-Con at any point, there's not even a Pikmin cameo.</p>
<p>Or is there? It feels to us like there's something missing in this short. Don't you get the impression that we <em>should</em> be seeing something carrying the dummy or pushing the blocks? Do we spy something moving under the bed in the background <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsufGY5I8jA&amp;t=99s">around 1:38</a>? Doesn't the music sound a little <em>too</em> Pikmin-coded?</p>

<p>The whole thing has a whiff of an invisible Pikmin scheme to us, but hey, that's just a theory. Whether this turns out to be something bigger, well, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this animated short? Do you think it will be part of something larger? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>

<p>Better late than never</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>More than five years after its initial console release, the retro FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ion_fury">Ion Fury</a> is finally getting its DLC expansion later this month.</p>
<p>Titled <strong>Ion Fury: Aftershock</strong>, the expansion was originally launched in October 2023 for PC, so it's been pretty much two whole years of waiting for console owners to receive the same treatment. Heck, a full sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phantom_fury">Phantom Fury</a>, has even launched in the interim.</p>

<p>Better late than never though, right? Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Uncharted Territories, Higher Stakes:</strong> Ignite the Fury with a gripping new campaign. Traverse 15 freshly-designed levels teeming with lurking adversaries.<br>
<strong><br>
Fresh Faces of Evil:</strong> Heskel’s been busy. Meet his new lineup of augmented monstrosities itching for a fight.<br>
<strong><br>
Packing More Heat:</strong> Enhance your firepower with new weapons and tools.<br>
<strong><br>
Push Your Limits:</strong> Challenge your skills with the grueling new Angel of Death difficulty level.<br>
<strong><br>
Ride On:</strong> Find out what a rotorcycle is and engage in white-knuckle vehicular combat.<br>
<strong><br>
Old, Yet New:</strong> Immerse yourself in Arrange mode for a fresh new take on all 28 levels from the original 2019 campaign, featuring new areas, new enemy encounters, and more.<br>
<strong><br>
Packed With Content:</strong> Engage in a total of 43 additional levels of sheer mayhem. See Ion Fury through a whole new lens.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Our review for Ion Fury back in 2020 described it as the "time-travelling love letter from the past you’ve been waiting for", praising its challenging combat and intricately designed levels, but noting that the boss battles were uninspired, ultimately awarding it a score of 7/10.</p>
