<p>Can we expect Starfield to make contact in 2026?</p>

<figure data-uuid="c45e2aa7eaf07"><a title="Starfield" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c45e2aa7eaf07/starfield.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-another-bethesda-game-is-landing-on-switch-2-its-claimed">rumour in August</a> about Bethesda's newest original IP <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield">Starfield</a> landing on the Switch 2 in 2026, a new story is now making the same claim.</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/is-xboxs-starfield-going-to-get-its-cyberpunk-2-0-moment-rumors-swirl-around-a-secret-event-and-a-ps5-launch">Windows Central Executive Editor Jez Corden</a>, who says the action role-playing space game will not only be arriving on the PlayStation 5 in 2026 but also Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Starfield will not only be getting its PlayStation 5 version in 2026, but also a Nintendo Switch 2 version on top."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds to this, mentioning how it will "hopefully" be a good experience on this particular portable unit, as the title has now undergone optimisations for "low power" devices like handhelds.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ox0NHxAh5v8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytox0NHxAh5v8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed78ab97ougkmi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The YouTuber and podcaster 'Nate the Hate' previously spoke about Starfield coming to the Switch 2 after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> was revealed for the same system at Gamescom Opening Night Live this year.</p>
<p>Since then, Bethesda has revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is on the way to Switch 2 at some point in 2026. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> also got a surprise release on the new device. However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">it hasn't got off to a good start</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the rumour about Starfield being released on more platforms, the same report mentions how the space outing will apparently be getting "big upgrades to space travel" (<em>and more</em>) alongside new DLC in 2026. Corden also says it's worth taking everything mentioned with "a pinch of salt".</p>

<p>The "superhero comedy" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> got announced for the Switch and Switch 2 this week, and following the initial reveal, <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Dispatch-Comes-to-Nintendo-Switch-1-and-2-on-January-28#:~:text=A%20free%20update%20will%20be,720p%20on%20the%20original%20console.">we've now got some details</a> about the game's performance.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version (which is a free upgrade for anyone who has the game on Switch) will offer "enhanced performance" of up to 60fps with 1440p resolution. And on the original Switch, players can expect 30fps and 720p resolution.</p>
<p>Exact frame rate and resolution differences between the portable and docked modes haven't been revealed.</p>
<p>Once again, when Dispatch launches on both of these platforms on <strong>28th January 2026</strong>, it will set you back <strong>$29.99</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>). Between now and the release date, you can also get a 10% discount on this price, bringing the total cost down to $26.99.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this upcoming release in our previous post here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>The good news is the fifth chapter is "really moving along" now. In saying this, the official release date could still be "several months" out. Fox also expects the team to be focused Chapter 6 in just "a few months":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> "If I had to give a realistic estimate, I believe that it will take several months to release the game from where we are now.</p>
<p>"It feels crazy to say this even though only 6 months ago you guys only had Chapters 1 and 2, but in a few months, much of the team will probably already be focusing their attention on Chapter 6..."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="htp-VfCtJow" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythtp-VfCtJow" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c7531rywgsj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>As for the current progress, work on localisation has just begun. And around January, the plan is to start investigating how the fifth chapter will operate on consoles.</p>
<p>Fox has also shared a few more details – noting how all the rooms in this chapter "are more or less done". Along with this, almost all the scenes in the chapter are complete, and most of the battles are also done. Players can look forward to "hours of fun" when it eventually arrives.</p>
<p>One last thing is Deltarune will be getting a sale this holiday season. It'll be 20% off on Steam, and this deal will apparently follow on console platforms "in the coming days".</p>
