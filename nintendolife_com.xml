<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162432/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a> featured in the Switch reveal trailer back in 2016, it was a statement of intent for the system. This was a big title in every sense of the word, and for the first time, Nintendo-only console owners could step into a Bethesda RPG and take it on the go, too. Sure, it was yet another version of a terminally re-released game, but it was also a key selling point for Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Fallout</strong>, the post-apocalyptic sister series to <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong>, has never had a mainline entry on Nintendo hardware. Aside from the vault management sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fallout_shelter">Fallout Shelter</a> back in 2018, Nintendo players have largely missed out. That makes the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> on Switch 2 worthy of real fanfare.</p>
<p>The second season of the TV show has rekindled interest in the franchise and alongside rumours of remasters of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_3">Fallout 3</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_new_vegas">New Vegas</a>, now feels like the perfect time to strap on the big iron and go for a wander.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162437/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like its fantasy counterpart, Fallout presents a huge open world that is easy to get lost in. It is packed with hundreds of quests, branching narratives, and NPCs driven by dynamic AI. The result is a living, breathing, and frequently broken world (more on that later).</p>
<p>Set in the irradiated wasteland of the Commonwealth — Boston and its surrounding areas — Fallout 4 offers a standalone adventure within the franchise's broader timeline. Your created character is torn from their idyllic suburban life when atomic war breaks out, forcing them to seek refuge in one of many corporate-built vaults. Awakened from cryogenic slumber, they witness the murder of their partner and the kidnapping of their infant son. Emerging into a world of mutated monsters and fractured tribal societies, they begin a desperate search to find their child.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162426/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You take on this new frontier using a combination of stealth, melee, and firearm skills, shaping your character through a versatile upgrade system. Combat leans heavily into the series' stylistic calling card, the slo-mo combat system V.A.T.S.</p>
<p>Like previous entries, the main quest is merely a jumping-off point for the wider mountain of tasks and diversions your wastelander will undertake. Along the way, you encounter different factions trying to survive and shape this crumbling world. Some, like the totalitarian Brotherhood of Steel, pursue domination through fascist ideology. Others, like the clandestine Institute, seek to rebuild civilisation through science.</p>
<p>You are free to pursue any of these groups up to a point, each faction questline leading to a late-game decision that will fundamentally change the main story's conclusion.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162434/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alternatively, you can just do… whatever you want. The wasteland is a gigantic sandbox, and there are no restrictions on your exploration. It's often the case that Bethesda Fallout titles carry their best content in ignorable side tasks, and that is certainly true here.</p>
<p>Starting strong with some great setpieces, your mission to find Shaun is ultimately shallow and convoluted. The best things to do in the Commonwealth happen off this beaten narrative path. Unlocking the mysteries of Cabot House or reliving the adventures of Silver Shroud are clear highlights among many. Elsewhere, there are one-off encounters and a wealth of locations to plunder. These moments capture Fallout at its most creative and memorable.</p>
<p>Then there’s the biggest diversion that Fallout 4 brought to the franchise - settlements. Early in your travels, you will meet Preston Garvey and his Minutemen, who guide you through building makeshift homes for wasteland survivors. Think of it like a post-apocalyptic <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>, except you have to defend your villagers from bandits high on Jet and Psycho.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162438/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like most aspects of Fallout 4, this surprisingly deep base-building can be largely ignored. It’s a love-it-or-hate-it time sink, so feel free to skip right over it, or alternatively spend hundreds of hours rebuilding civilisation in your own image.</p>
<p>This toolset is further expanded by the numerous workshop bundles included in the Anniversary Edition. This bumper, all-in package is also bolstered by shorter questlines like Nuka World and Automatron, the latter of which introduces customisable robot companions.</p>
<p>The main course of extra content is the excellent Far Harbour. Here, you join synth companion Nick Valentine on an expedition to the titular island. This expansion features new quests, enemies, and compelling faction storylines.</p>
<p>So, Fallout 4 is a game that’s constantly giving, bursting at the seams with content and endlessly replayable thanks to a deep upgrade system and multiple routes through the story. But content is one thing, experience is another. This is a Bethesda RPG and Switch 2 port; the proof will ultimately be in the optimisation.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162433/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You have three performance modes to choose from in the main menu. 30, 40, and 60fps offer quality, balanced and performance options, respectively. Given this game is a couple of generations old and has been optimised for the current platforms, all of these modes are pleasingly stable from a visual standpoint.</p>
<p>Higher frame modes add softer edges to textures, which mars the fidelity of the long-distance vistas somewhat. There is also the occasional frame dip in busier scenes on any mode, but these issues are rare across a long playthrough.</p>
<p>I chose to play mostly at 40fps as it removed that texture smoothing and maintained stable frames. It’s worth noting that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/fallout-4-on-switch-2-is-getting-dlss-support-and-stability-improvements">an announced update</a> will add DLSS to 40 and 60fps modes, alongside some stability fixes.</p>
<p>Far more pronounced than the occasional frame hiccup is the rich suite of bugs and technical issues carried over from previous incarnations of the game. Unfortunately, the Switch 2 version does not make any effort to iron out these kinks.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162435/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I spent most of my playthrough dealing with a bug that completely disabled sprint (reminder to always be saving, people). This isn’t a fun issue to have when you have alpha Deathclaws snapping at your back. I also suffered multiple audio issues, scripting glitches, and good old-fashioned crashes. Much like the performance fluctuations, these bugs become diluted over a long enough period. They still frustrate every time they occur, though.</p>
<p>It’s customary for Bethesda titles to arrive on a new platform with an existing suite of issues still intact, of course. It’s just a shame that Fallout’s first appearance on a Nintendo console is blighted by a less-than-optimal experience.</p>
<p>Further disappointment comes from the complete lack of Switch 2 system features, such as gyro or mouse controls. Mouse control in particular feels egregious, especially considering how comfortably the series plays on PC.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In spite of its issues, Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition remains a key title for the console. It’s a hugely generous package that looks great and, much like Skyrim before it, is very enjoyable to play undocked.</p>
<p>It’s Fallout, on Switch 2. A giant experience, overflowing with content and featuring some of the best quests in the series, and a mostly great visual optimisation that tests patience with more bugs than a bloatfly nest. If you can endure its (many) technical shortcomings, there are hundreds of hours of solid RPG here.</p></section>

<p>There was plenty of juicy news this week, as we saw <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/balatro">Balatro</a> arrive in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/balatros-back-to-steal-all-your-spare-time-in-new-switch-2-version">all-new Switch 2 version</a> (RIP our spare time), Nintendo continued to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/donkey-kong-bananza-has-been-updated-to-version-3-2-0">waves of updates</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/poll-whats-your-favourite-3ds-model">3DS turned 15</a>, and that's not to mention everything we heard in the annual <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-february-2026-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Pokémon Day Presents</a> showcase.</p>
<p>It was reviews that stole the show this time, however, as we shared our thoughts on a bunch of Resident Evils — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Village Gold Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Biohazard Gold Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">9/10</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">9/10</a>) — as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/caves-of-qud">8/10</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">The Disney Afternoon Collection</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-disney-afternoon-collection">8/10</a>).</p>
<p>Now then, what's everyone up to this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:198088,198072 @ 1772287472 -->
<h2>Alex Olney, Senior Video Producer</h2>
<p>As much as I'd like to say I'm planning on playing Resident Evil Requiem this weekend, I can't make that claim. That's because I've already completed it like the cheeky boy that I am. Instead, I'll be dipping my toes into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across The Unknown</a>, and probably spending 50% of that time allocated to Janeway's adventures in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> because I have a problem.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Apologies for the last two weeks of silence, haven’t had much time for video games due to “adulting”, but I'll make it up this week because not only is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Arcade Archives 2 Rave Racer</a> on the grid, but something else I have been quite looking forward to: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/raiden_fighters_remix_collection">Raiden Fighters Remix Collection</a>! Time to dust off my arcade stick. Oh, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron">FUR Squadron</a> sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron_phoenix">FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>, has been released without much fanfare and is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_fox_64">Star Fox 64</a> in all but name. Do a barrel roll… ish! Rounding it all off is a major update on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> that brings the new Tech Marine class to the table. Bless the Omnissiah and whatnot... but where is the Switch 2 port?</p>
<p>My game of the week is Resident Evil Requiem. It has been a very long time since I played a Resi game on release day (I believe <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a> 2019 remake was the last), and seeing the latest RE Engine entry in the series running this well on Switch 2 gives me great hope for future Capcom support on the system.</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>After playing the ever-so-lovely <strong>Resi</strong> games for the review on Monday, I think my nerves need a wee break with some cosy games. I've been playing even more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> (I'm obsessed now) and some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cast_n_chill">Cast n Chill</a>. I still intend on jumping back onto Resi 7 &amp; Village as I really enjoyed both of them. I'm determined to have nerves of steel by the end of the year!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still on my classic Pokémon kick with all the 'mon news in recent weeks and have been enjoying training up my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Emerald</a> squad after getting sufficiently <em>whooped</em> by Tate and Liza in Mossdeep's Psychic Gym. It really takes me back to the good old days, and I'm doing everything in my power to resist dropping 20 quid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed</a> this weekend to do it all over again on Switch.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This week is the Steam Next Fest, and though I usually abhor playing a demo (I'm too hungry to eat just a snack), I have been playing tons of demos on stream this week to entertain my friends! It's been a mixed bag, for sure, but some real gems in there, too. I'm going to be keeping an eye out for any of them coming to Switch, so I can say "aha! I knew it was good ages ago. I am very cool" and everyone will nod and respect me for my deep wisdoms. That's the plan, anyway.</p>

<p>Capcom has done it again</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has done a great job with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but if you're still debating about it and the PlayStation 5 release, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://youtu.be/8izgK3xQHWY">shared a side-by-side comparison</a> of the game running on the Switch 2 and the PS5 Pro, and as you can see, the wizards behind other Switch 2 ports such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> have done it again!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/dlss-is-the-game-changer-for-resident-evil-requiems-impressive-switch-2-port?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Digital Foundry</a> mentioned in its own technical analysis, the Switch 2 is running a low internal resolution in docked but this version and the PS5 release actually end up comparing "fairly equivocally", and it's all thanks to DLSS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Foundry:</strong> On paper, a 540p image blown up to 1080p on a modern flat panel display doesn't sound great. However, DLSS looks surprisingly competitive. Fine detail like wires and fences can actually appear more temporally stable on Switch 2, while PS5's spatial upscaling solution (likely FSR1 or similar) looks noisier and less refined in motion. PS5 still wins overall on clarity, aided by its higher internal resolution and 4K UI (Switch 2 uses a 1080p UI), but the gap is much narrower than raw pixel counts would suggest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of cutbacks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-analysis-of-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-capcom-deserves-kudos-for-this-port">as previously noted</a>, geometry is pared back in the Switch 2 version and there are lower-quality textures. Capcom has also taken a "different" approach to the character hair design on Nintendo's new hardware, but overall it's a solid effort.</p>

<p>Game Freak is moving on from the original Switch hardware</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 generation last year, certain first-party titles have received cross-platform releases. Trainers saw this with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but this won't be the case for the new mainline entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, The Pokémon Company has clearly stated in official press materials and the new webpage how these next-generation entries developed by Game Freak are "exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2". In other words, Nintendo's existing hybrid platform isn't part of the plans.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjmkzyh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a glance, this new generation is already looking quite promising, and Game Freak potentially has over a year to polish the experience, with the titles currently scheduled for a 2027 release.</p>
<p>So, this means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> and Legends: Z-A are likely the last "major" new entries that will be released on Nintendo's original Switch hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo previously said it would continue supporting the original Switch as long as there's an audience, but also understands "exclusive games are crucial when launching new hardware" and intends to shift support to its new hybrid system as the fan base grows.</p>

<figure data-uuid="27101ee173e6e"><a title="Pokémon FireRed Version" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27101ee173e6e/pokemon-firered-version.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the joys for many trainers during the earlier generations of Pokémon was giving the main character and their rival a rude or downright inappropriate name. In the Switch eShop versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a>, it seems there have been some updates to this.</p>
<p>As reported by Kotaku, you'll either have to get <em>really</em> creative now, or there's a good chance the game will override whatever you've input and instead give you a generic name. Here's a sample of some of the words that won't fly:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnkrvit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p><em>"Kotaku</em> has verified that some words, such as “d**k,” “p***y,” “s**t,” and even the f-slur are replaced by names like “Gary” or “Janne.” This doesn’t seem to extend to some milder words, however, as “hell” and “damn” were not replaced."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This update appears to impact Pokémon names as well. One theory suggests the update is to prevent users from flooding social media with screenshots and footage containing offensive language. It could also potentially be linked to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a>. Either way, some names wouldn't be the best look, as Pokémon is intended to be a friendly experience for all ages.</p>
<p>As many trainers have highlighted, this confirms these classic Game Boy Advance releases have actually been edited for this special release. There have also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-version-gives-you-the-mystic-ticket-and-aurora-ticket">some other updates...</a></p>
