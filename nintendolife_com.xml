<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156529/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>In honour of the game's arrival on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-games-list-every-nintendo-classics-retro-game-on-nso-plus-expansion-pack#nintendo-switch-online-switch-2-gamecube-games-3">the Nintendo Classics GameCube lineup</a>, here's our new retro review of one of Link's most memorable adventures...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If I were to put together a list of my favourite pre-Switch-era <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">Zelda</a> games, those that came before the franchise-transforming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, where would 2002's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> fit in?</p>
<p>It's an interesting one, a divisive game for a couple of reasons, but for me personally it lands in the top three, which — considering there are over 40 games to choose from (if we go all in with spin-offs) — is a <em>pretty</em> good result.</p>
<p>Yes, some may have baulked at the cel-shaded graphics when they were revealed (didn't get the hate then, don't get it now), whilst others saw the whole wind-conducting and sailing about in a boat as a waste of time, but I absolutely adored everything about it. There may also have been the <em>odd</em> fan who'd sort of grown up with the grittier Ocarina Link, who then didn't welcome this return to younger and more innocent/cutesy days, but we're sure they got over it once they played the thing.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156532/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Because of course, this is a Zelda game that's come to be almost universally loved over time, with any perceived flaws or design dislikes smoothed over once players got to grips with its succession of delightful dungeons whose deviousness comes as a nice surprise when you consider the cute, colourful nature of director and series producer Eiji Aonuma's bold graphical overhaul.</p>
<p>Like any great game in this series, Wind Waker is a masterclass in how an adventure game should flow, in terms of narrative, in terms of how it doles out its new tools and upgrades, and in how it constantly raises the bar with regards to dungeons that test you at every turn. Once you've gotten into its rhythms and made peace with sailing around, settling into a slower pace at times as you journey around this most beguiling of worlds, it's hard not to be very impressed indeed, even if you're not 100% a fan of the (amazing) art style.</p>
<p>There's an enchanting quality — a Saturday morning TV serial sort of charm — to this pirate adventure that, every single time I sit down to play it, draws me right in. I want to shimmy along its ledges, grapple and swing on its ropes, glide with a big leaf through its...undergrowth? Who on earth wouldn't want to spend a whole bunch of time exploring these delights?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/accessibility-report/2707/embed @ 1749400740 -->
<p>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, in this GameCube form, <em>is</em> missing the nips and tucks and an HD lick of paint from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker_hd">the later Wii U revamp</a>. But really, it makes very little difference - well, as long as the speedier boat wasn't a killer fix for you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-do-you-prefer-zelda-wind-waker-hds-bloom-lighting-or-the-flat-og">Some may even prefer the original's colour tone</a>, so you're not missing any real <em>game-changing</em> benefits in sticking with the classic form.</p>
<p>And what a form! This is a wonderfully streamlined, manageable, and constantly engaging slice of Zelda. It doesn't bog you down in busywork (hello, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Depths), and seeks to charm, surprise and excite at every turn.</p>
<p>You'll come to love sailing your (talking) raft, I'd wager, even come to love all the little repetitive rituals that are part and parcel of setting off for a new adventure. Yes, it can be a bit tedious, but it's so unlike other games, having all this peaceful space to mill around in whilst you fill in the game's delightful little chart of 49 puzzle-y islands. What an adventure.</p>

<p>It's the sort of game whose sandy beaches and windswept waves linger long in the memory. It's also got one of the best variants of Link, so full of expression and goofiness, if you have any misgivings going in, you'll likely have been put at ease by the time the fantastic tutorial opener is done.</p>
<p>This most lively and acrobatic of heroes is also a dab hand when it comes to combat, giving you a fresh and slick take on the series' decades-old, lock-on style of battle that still feels absolutely great to this day, with its swishy sword tricks and flipping around. If you come to Zelda for the usual flow of smart new tools and upgrades that keep things fresh as an epic narrative unfurls, well, you're in for a good time, too. The dungeons and storyline here are series-best stuff (again, pre-BOTW). I won't spoil it, if you're one of the few who've yet to play it, but let's just say that, besides one or two rushed sequences near the end, this is a cracker, and a game that manages to end in an interestingly downbeat, dark-ish way.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156530/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>If you come for cute towns packed full of red-nosed NPCs, weird shopkeepers, tons of collectibles, goofy side quests, and enough entertaining side stuff to balloon the running time from 30ish hours for a campaign-focused run, to around the 70-hour mark for full 100% completion, this old chestnut still has it where it counts. Zelda's kooky, eccentric brand of worldbuilding never lets you down, and that's not something that changed with this entry.</p>
<p>So, you're not getting the flashy HD version here, obviously, and the original — as much as I personally have no issues with it — does do things a little...well...it can be clunky at times, for sure. The speedier boat is a nice thing to have, let's say that much, and it stings once you've had it on Wii U and then have to go without.</p>
<p>There's also that one godawful late-game questathon that they shortened for the HD revamp (you know the one), but again that's not so much a deal-breaker as a slightly annoying bit of padding. Still, worth noting as it's one of my precious few actual issues with this delightful, 'toon-styled romp, though.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156527/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Apart from these hang-ups, though, Zelda: The Wind Waker, from its gloriously sunny opening to its (kinda dark) ending, is a blast, and one of my favourite Zelda games overall. In fact, only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a> top this one for me, if we're talking pre-BotW. I've replayed it a few times now, and it never loses the power to draw you in, once you're over the hump of the tutorial and into the meat of the deviously delightful dungeons on offer. What a timeless treat.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The HD revamp on Wii U may have added a few nice quality-of-life tweaks, but the original GameCube version of The Wind Waker is still an utterly charming and hugely enjoyable romp. The flashy sword-based combat still sings, banging around in your talking boat still feels epic, and the dungeons and narrative delights along the way ensure that this remains one of Link's finest outings. Indeed, bar the odd clunky mission and a rather slow mode of transport, this is right up there with the very best pre-BOTW Zelda games ever made.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156621/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>We’re making this a trend now, huh? It’s never long before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> makes its way onto the scene. Such was the case back in 2017 with the launch of the original Switch, when a worldwide release of 2014’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> (which released on Wii U and 3DS in Japan) served as one of the very first games available for Nintendo's then-fledgling hybrid.</p>
<p>It was arguably a ‘right place, right time’ moment for the crossover franchise, appealing to casual Tetris fans, puzzle game die-hards, and the massive influx of players just looking for more things to play on their shiny new system. Crucially, it helped reintroduce Puyo Puyo to the wider global market after a lengthy hiatus from localising the franchise.</p>
<p>Now, it seems Sega is aiming to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a> — an enhanced port of 2020’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> — as one of the very first games available for Switch 2. Unfortunately, some bizarre choices within and surrounding this release prevent it from shining as bright as previous entries.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156615/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S takes the sequel that once more mashed the worlds of Puyo Puyo and Tetris and tosses in a handful of new features, many of which are designed to take advantage of Switch 2’s new functionality. That sounds like a pretty solid grab on paper, but a deeper dive into what’s <em>actually</em> new this time around leaves this re-release feeling unjustified.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Switch review of Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a>, Scully found it to be a worthy sequel crammed with ways to experience the titular two giants of the falling-block puzzle genre. That’s all still true in this version, which retains the original’s wealth of modes, unlockables, customisability options, and more. Whether it’s a simple alternating battle between Puyo Puyo and Tetris, a mode where miniscule Puyos drop from the sky, a fast-paced race to clear 40 rows in Tetris, or Skill Battles that completely change the game by introducing light RPG elements and abilities, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S does an excellent job keeping that simplistic core gameplay loop fresh and varied.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156619/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its replayability is bolstered by the Adventure Mode, which offers up a light-hearted story featuring the Puyo Puyo cast and a bunch of levels to chew through, as well as its multiplayer modes, which turn it into quite the entertaining party game for the right crowd.</p>
<p>In contrast to all of that juicy returning content, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S adds just a single new mode: Puyo Tetris Doubles. This introduces 2v2 battles to the mix, in which each team must control and drop two Puyos or Tetriminos simultaneously on the same board. Critically, your pieces have collision physics with one another, meaning you need to carefully coordinate with your partner to stay out of each other’s way and drop the pieces in the right places.</p>
<p>It’s a solid addition that can lead to some fun multiplayer chaos, as you desperately beg your friend to please, <em>please</em>, get their annoying square block out of the way so you can nail a T-spin in just the right place.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156618/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of that said, Puyo Tetris Doubles mode feels like a small addition to the greater scheme of the game. This sentiment only grows stronger when considering that the mode is limited to a select number of game styles (Versus, Party, and Fusion) and that you absolutely need other players for it to be any fun at all. While Puyo Tetris Doubles can be played with CPU partners and opponents, you’ll be banging your head against a wall trying to wordlessly coordinate with the AI. As such, single-player gamers are effectively left out in the cold when it comes to just about any substantial new content in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S.</p>
<p>Outside of the one new multiplayer-centric mode, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is pretty light on enhancements. The game certainly looks better on the new hardware, with a resolution bump to keep things looking nice and crisp, and it runs buttery smooth. This version also adds native GameShare and GameChat support, letting you share your copy of the game wirelessly and online with friends.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the incorporation of the Switch 2’s new camera and mouse mode abilities. Players can use a connected camera to superimpose their face on various parts of the board during gameplay — a fun, if ultimately superfluous, little addition.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156613/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I don’t have anything as kind to say about the new mouse controls, which feel genuinely awful and imprecise for Puyo Puyo and Tetris gameplay compared to traditional gamepad input. Your mileage may vary, but it feels distressingly reminiscent of the shoehorned touch and waggle gimmicks that plagued the DS and Wii days. The only saving grace in my eyes is that it’s purely an optional input method and can be viewed as a weird little novelty.</p>
<p>And, well…that’s it. Aside from a few other minute adjustments to the experience, the features outlined above are really the only new things available in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. The game feels like it was just <em>slightly</em> updated and tweaked for release on Switch 2 compared to its Switch incarnation, which makes Sega’s release and pricing strategy for this title all the more baffling.</p>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S continues Sega’s frustrating trend of not offering any sort of upgrade path for its Switch 2 games. Just as with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</a>, you’ll need to purchase the Switch 2 version of the game at full price, even if you own a copy on Switch 1. There may be some reason to do that for the other aforementioned titles, which see substantial performance bumps on Switch 2, but that’s not the case for Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. This new version is barely any different from the original release and offers <em>very</em> little to anyone who played Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 the first time around.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156614/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even beyond the egregious pricing strategy, dividing Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S from its non-enhanced counterpart feels like a misstep that could seriously affect the longevity of this game from a multiplayer perspective. There’s no crossplay between the titles, which means that the online experience and player base are even further segmented than before. In the days immediately after launch, I tried multiple times to find any online matches and failed to find an opponent every single time. That could potentially improve as more people dive into the Switch 2 ecosystem in the days ahead, but it feels like a dark omen for this version’s community and future.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>More than most, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is a tough release to put a score on. Under no circumstances is it a bad game — in fact, it’s a pretty darn decent game that’s filled to the brim with modes and features to tide puzzle lovers over for the long haul. However, that has everything to do with the solid skeleton of the original Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 and barely anything to do with the minimal additions made to this Switch 2 re-release.</p>
<p>For newcomers to the series or those who missed its original release, there’s plenty of fun to be had here. For fans who already have the original version on Switch, I struggle to think of a greater waste of Switch 2 gaming funds than this.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156640/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Altogether now! <em>"This should have been a pack-in."</em></p>
<p>Or, if that simply wasn't on the table, free for the first year. Or free with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. It's painfully obvious to everybody but Nintendo that paywalling this specific software further behind the already-pricey console is a mistake.</p>
<p>And it's a real shame that more people won't experience it, because it makes you feel good about your sizeable investment in the hardware. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> is a peaceful, in-depth exploration of the system, taking you around and inside the device, its controllers, and peripherals (some sold separately - more on that later), and highlighting its various features and novelties. This is the platform holder celebrating and deep-diving into its tech in a way that feels unusual but also <em>very</em> Nintendo.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156649/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, the granular tech focus here is a necessity. Switch 2, by its nature, is an iteration on a theme, so if you're going to charge a hefty sum for something superficially 'the same but bigger', what better way than to highlight <em>every single</em> upgrade in a fun, demo-filled game of hide-and-seek that breaks it all down?</p>
<p>And the devs really do break it <em>all</em> down. You'll be running around capacitors, over circuit boards, batteries, and myriad chips and components that appear to be modelled extremely faithfully. This is Nintendo tearing down its hardware virtually so you don't have to, and being remarkably frank in some regards. There are various examples of 'we did our best' while discussing the challenges faced with, for instance, dispersing heat and optimising battery longevity. There's no console-wars chest-beating here; it's all very self-effacing. It's essentially an Iwata Asks/Ask the Developer interview in game form.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156635/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game itself takes the form of an explorative, isometric walking-sim affair. You control a person jogging (or running if you hold down 'B') around an oversized Switch 2 and accessories propped up and exhibited across an enormous park. Or are you tiny and the Switch normal-sized? It's never made clear, but hot Welcome Tour lore aside, you run around the virtual gear while the real-life gear throws novel audio-visual and haptic feedback at you. It's a particularly great showcase for HD rumble 2 - I only hope that devs take the time to implement it properly in other games.</p>
<p>Stamp Rally plinths pop up when you approach components and gate progress between areas. So, to get to the main console, you have to locate 18 stamps on the left Joy-Con, and so on. Simple enough, though some less obvious ones do present a challenge, usually when the button or port is on the inaccessible underside and you're hunting for the plinth.</p>
<p>Then there are the minigames, with multiple variations of the same game grouped on little exhibits across the hardware. It's all very 'Switch 2 Experience' for anybody who attended those pre-launch events. There are over 50 games and beating them earns medals to unlock harder variants.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156642/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some, naturally, are better than others. The Mouse Mode ones are <em>generally</em> more challenging and/or frustrating. Removing stains with a paint scraper was much harder on my leg or the arm of the sofa than on a table (where I donned the Joy-Con straps and got the medals first try); my lap or a cushion worked fine with other games, though. If you do hit a wall with one, just move on. You're able to instantly warp to anything you've visited by hitting 'X' to bring up the menu and selecting it, a real godsend.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, you'll be hunting floating pixels, shooting balloons, colouring within the lines, guessing the angle of the kickstand - all sorts. Only one minigame — Breaststroke: Floaty Frustration — is outright bad (it lives up to its name), and while there's nothing here you're likely to fire up again once you've completed the game, they're all effective at demonstrating the possibilities of your shiny new console.</p>
<p>On that theme, and beyond the realm of proper 'games', 14 tech demos highlight neat functions and features, letting you test the noise reduction qualities of the built-in microphone, make the Joy-Con emit sound effects, and plenty more. The 3D Sound demo with the helicopter is a particular highlight, but they're all fun to mess around with. My kids absolutely loved sawing logs, shaking maracas, and hearing themselves with robot voices. The HDR demo didn't wow me, but these are cool toys to play with. Who wouldn't want to rev a motorbike with a Joy-Con?</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156641/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond <em>that</em>, dozens of info desks contain multiple-choice quizzes testing your knowledge of nearby Insight boards. It's here where Nintendo goes into detail about the hows and whys of design, and in all honesty, it's incredibly interesting for anybody with a penchant for gaming hardware.</p>
<p>The light-hearted quiz questions aren't taxing if you're paying any attention whatsoever to the slides, though it's fun to imagine a world where 'Love' or 'Glue' hold the Joy-Con on. They do get progressively more challenging as you journey inside the console, but there's typically one comedy answer, two vague possibilities, and the obvious correct one. Get a question wrong and the relevant Insight board is flagged, so you can quickly swot up and repeat.</p>
<p>Burning through Insights for review isn't the best way to digest them, and they got repetitive towards the end. One named 'Games Use Electricity' isn't as blindingly obvious as it sounds, but the title made me guffaw. You're not obliged to do any of the quiz stuff, either, and along the way there's lost property to find, some charming NPC writing, cute moments as you skate across the screen, and a bunch of nostalgic nods to Nintendo history.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156639/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are also some smirk-worthy 'purely for reference' disclaimers when they show animations of the Joy-Con being wrenched from the console and other non-sanctioned actions, but Welcome Tour feels like Nintendo being refreshingly open and surprisingly confident. I can't imagine any other platform holder going into this sort of forensic detail for fear of a red-ring-level embarrassment down the line. It might even help allay fears about another Joy-Con drift debacle this gen, as the new mechanisms feature very prominently here.</p>
<p>There's an assuredness in inviting this kind of scrutiny; an admirable pride in the work. "I can't believe they're showing us as much as they are," says one of the milling NPCs, and I can only agree. It's a quality product.</p>
<p>And a surprisingly lengthy one. Due to the weird 10-day delay before playtime data is shown on your profile, I can't say exactly how many hours I've spent opening everything and getting nearly all the medals, but it's got to be seven or eight (and at least one of those was spent on the nightmare dual-mouse UFO bullet hell/star collection minigame). <em>[Update: So it seems Nintendo changed this at some point? I just checked again and it now states "10 hours or more," while the Nintendo Switch App says "11 hour(s) or more" - not sure why there's a disparity, but that total includes 30 mins of battery-testing idle time, plus extra for note-taking.]</em> There are 12 'areas' in all, going from the top of the left Joy-Con into the system itself via the dock, the Joy-Con grip and straps, and even peripherals that don't come with the system - specifically the Camera, the Pro Controller, and the Joy-Con wheels.</p>

<p>If you don't own those things? You can still earn 'fast-track medals' from them via a cute little SOS trick, so progress isn't gated behind them. However, access to a handful of minigames and demos <em>are</em> effectively blocked if you don't have the requisite gear (the Camera, a pad which has the 'GL'/'GR' buttons, and a 4K TV).</p>
<p>For me, it's nothing to get too upset about — there's so much else to be getting on with, and what's the alternative? Remove those experiences entirely? — but it's <em>another</em> straw on the camel's back if you're already irritated by the cost. It also highlights another unavoidable aspect of Welcome Tour: as well as being part instruction manual, part demo, it's also an ad for those lovely accessories you <em>didn't</em> pick up. Yet.</p>
<p>There's an undeniable allure to seeing pristine hardware at this resolution, too, without the skin cells and dust particles and pet hairs and assorted household detritus that attaches itself the moment you remove the packaging. Welcome Tour is deliciously, fetishistically sterile, with gorgeous specular highlights on the logos as you run across them, close-ups of glistening ports and shiny sticks. It tickles the same zones as Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/astro_bot">Astro Bot</a> in some ways, though this is much more of a museum piece.</p>

<p>It does a fantastic job of highlighting the design chops and consideration that goes into every aspect of Nintendo's products, from the 0.05mm height adjustments to individual face buttons to the minuscule tab on a single foot of the dock that means it will slide (rather than topple over) if you accidentally yank it with a cable connected.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Welcome Tour is modestly priced ($9.99 / £7.99), too, despite the wider economic context surrounding Switch 2's launch and the general upset over pricing across the industry which makes charging for it feel like the last straw. For your buck, there's a surprising amount of bang, though.</p>
<p>So, one more time, then: <em>This 100% should have been a pack-in.</em> But the software itself? It's great.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Welcome Tour is a calming, surprisingly engaging hardware exhibition with a handful of cool minigames, a trove of interesting info, and some neat demos that showcase exactly what the little system can do. It makes you feel good about buying the thing, which makes the platform holder's decision <em>not</em> to bundle it with the console utterly baffling. Featuring expensive add-ons you might not own also won't impress anyone who's indignant that the company wants another 10 bucks for this.</p>
<p>That aside, it's an undeniably fine demonstration of Nintendo's thoughtful design approach. It's cute, it's fun, and it's a shame the whole pack-in argument overshadows the delightful software. Anyone interested in tech, design, or Nintendo in general should check it out immediately.</p></section>
