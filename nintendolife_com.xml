<figure><a title="Sonic Timberlands" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a1224762b865/sonic-timberlands.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/these-sonic-the-hedgehog-crocs-are-kinda-horrific-and-theyre-out-now">collaborating on a pair of Crocs</a> back in 2023, SEGA is continuing its streak of 'Footwear That Would Be Inappropriate For Sonic The Hedgehog' with a new pair of Sonic-inspired Timberland kicks.</p>
<p>Let's manage those expectations right from the jump. It's unlikely that most of us will ever get our hands on a pair of these bad boys. The collab is in celebration of the upcoming grand opening of SEGA's flagship store in Japan, and will <em>only</em> be available at the nearby Shibuya PARCO Timberland store from 9th August.</p>
<p>Now that we know we're never going to see the range in the flesh, let's collectively cry over how cool it all looks. The highlight item is, of course, a pair of Timbs, which takes the classic "yellow" boot design and throws in some sneaky Sonic nods for good measure. There's a small picture of the blue blur himself etched onto the outer material, the Sonic the Hedgehog icon adorns the inner side, and get a look at those laces!</p>

<p>According to the collaboration announcement on the <a href="https://www.timberland.co.jp/news-250805_sega.html">Japanese Timberland website</a>, the boots will set you back ¥38,500 (roughly £196 / $261) and there are <em>apparently</em> only 30 pairs available. Yep, we're sure people will behave totally normally in the queues for these...</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some other items in the range besides the boots. The collaboration also introduces two long- and short-sleeve t-shirts, available in black or white. Both tops sport the rather snazzy collab icon of Sonic in his Timbs, with the brand logos on the sleeve/chest.</p>

<p>And just to rub it in even more, anyone lucky enough to pick up an item in the range will <em>also</em> land an exclusive postcard and sticker of the boot-wearing hedgehog. Damn, we're suckers for a good sticker...</p>
<p>As we say, it's unlikely that we'll ever see much of the range in person thanks to the ol' Japanese exclusivity, but who knows, perhaps it'll be so popular that it gets a bigger release in the future. We doubt it, but let us dream!</p>

<p>Out this December</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last week, during Nintendo's partner showcase, Square Enix lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> - a new entry in the HD-2D series where you'll customise and play as your own character.</p>
<p>Square Enix has already shared quite a bit about this upcoming release, and now it seems it's been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board ahead of its arrival this December. It's 'T' for "Teen" and contains blood, fantasy violence, language and suggestive themes.</p>
<p>Here's the official ESRB description, which goes into detail about all of the themes mentioned in the classification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is rated T for Teen by the ESRB with Blood, Fantasy Violence, Language, and Suggestive Themes. This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a traveler searching for sacred rings. As players explore a fantastical world, they assemble companions to engage in turn-based battles against human, animal, and monster enemies. Graphics are highly pixelated, with gameplay and cutscenes taking place from a distant perspective. Players use bladed weapons and elemental attacks to deplete opponents' health/hit points; combat is highlighted by impact sounds and light effects. Cutscenes depict additional violence involving small, pixelated characters: characters holding knives to their throats; cultists repeatedly stabbing a character; a man strangling a woman; a villain killing an unarmed civilian. Some characters are depicted with bloodstained clothing; a handful of scenes depict rooms with bloodstained corpses. The game contains some suggestive/sexual material: text describing a prostitute character (e.g., “sold their little sister to a brothel in a far-off land...In a distant land, their sister sold her body for coin.”); other dialogue (e.g., “Did you pleasure my old man last night you dirty wh*re”); stylized female monsters wearing revealing outfits (e.g., large amounts of cleavage/breasts). The word “sh*t” appears in the game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Switch 2 release is a Game-Key Card, and Square Enix says there are no plans to allow the Switch version to be upgraded in the future.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0 will release on the Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>One of the many announcements during last week's Nintendo's Partner showcase was the Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>With the game now available for the Switch 2 this week, Respawn Entertainment has outlined the game's performance details on this new platform. Here's the full rundown along with some information about the download process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Enjoy up to <strong>60 FPS</strong>, depending on monitor/hardware capability and compatibility (<strong>1920x1080 docked</strong>, <strong>1792x1008 undocked</strong>)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- When you login, you’ll be redirected to the eShop to download Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch 2. You’ll be able to delete “Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch” after you login to the updated version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you log into your Apex Legends account on the Switch or Switch 2 before <strong>16th September 2025</strong>, you'll also receive the "P.A.T.H." Pathfinder Skin!.</p>
<p>You can see the full patch notes for this latest update on EA's website. Once again, this game is a free download on the Switch 2. In terms of the estimated file size, according to the eShop it's a <strong>31.7 GB</strong> download.</p>
