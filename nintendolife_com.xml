<p>The demo arrives on the Switch eShop — for both the Switch 1 and 2 versions of the game — at <strong>9pm PST</strong> <strong>today</strong> (that's <strong>midnight EST</strong> and <strong>5am BST</strong> on <strong>5th November)</strong> and will allow you to play up to Episode 2.</p>
<p>And yes, of <em>course</em> you'll be able to transfer your progress over to the full game. That's the best thing about these demos. So it's the perfect way to try the game out if you're on the fence. You don't have to replay anything if you decide to pick it up, and if you don't gel with it, well, that's okay too!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067spnikl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>In case you missed it earlier this year, Raidou Remastered is a completely refreshed version of the 2006 PS2 action RPG <strong>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</strong>, which itself is part of the Devil Summoner spin-off series from the Megami Tensei series.</p>
<p>The remaster features completely overhauled visuals and compat, full voice acting, fast travel, the ability to save anywhere, and a number of other quality-of-life features.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">reviewed the Switch 2 version</a> of the game when it launched on 19th June 2025, calling it "a wonderful retread of a forgotten classic", though with some quibbles about the visuals and some simplistic gameplay elements.</p>

<p>This is the Raye</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Holiday season is almost upon us (this writer's local supermarket rolled out the advent calendars weeks ago), and Nintendo UK is equally keen to spread some festive cheer with its new TV ads.</p>
<p>This year's offering once again puts the record-breaking singer-songwriter star Raye front and centre, showing that even Brit-winners like to let off some steam with a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-uks-latest-switch-advert-shows-just-how-little-we-know-about-pop-music">last year's affair</a>, which also starred Raye, the ads focus on the family-friendly joy of a Nintendo system, as if to say, "forget the Brits, Grammys and Forbes list, only a Switch 2 can make you <em>this</em> happy". And once again, we'd be lying if we said that Raye doesn't do a good job of selling it — that's the face of someone who knows the joys of smashing a Crockoid in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Sure, it's cheesier than a Christmas cheese board, but nobody's after gritty realism from a holiday ad.</p>
<p>While Raye is this year's returning face, it's the <em>first</em> festive ads for the Switch 2 — hence all the GameChat and Mouse Mode. Expect to see similar shots of merry, bright faces playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> via a Switch 2 Camera for years to come...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a331f14a956ca"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a331f14a956ca/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The world of video games hasn't provided much respite from global issues recently, not for those of us who love games and the people who make them. The issues facing the industry and players post-COVID — including mass layoffs, cancelled projects, questionable acquisitions, the encroachment of generative AI, rising prices, an unstable economy and a cost-of-living crisis — mean it's easy to assume there's no going back.</p>
<p>But just when you catch yourself pondering whether the good ol' days of games as an artistic medium and pastime are numbered, just when it looks like we're hurtling down a F2P, games-as-a-service slide greased with AI-generated turds, Nintendo goes and proves that there's life in the old console model yet.</p>
<p>All the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">hardware numbers following launch</a> have been encouraging, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">today's financial results</a> give a much better picture of Switch 2's status, including figures from its first full quarter on the market. Any console from the big platform holders would be expected to sell well early doors, but numbers from July to September have maintained good momentum throughout a summer period where sales traditionally dry up in the biggest gaming territories.</p>
<p>To recap, Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units since launch, causing the company to bump up its first-year sales forecast from 15 to 19 million ahead of the holidays. Software forecasts have also been bumped from 45 to 48 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="061603600aafb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/061603600aafb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193371 @ 1762284657 -->
<p>As you might expect, especially when its successor offers very broad backwards compatibility with performance improvements, Switch 1 numbers have plummeted 60% year-on-year. Yet 1.89 million isn't a bad figure either, and Nintendo still thinks it can sell 4 million OG Switches this financial year, half a million fewer than previous forecasts. Switch 1 is just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">10,000 units away from DS' all-time console record</a>, with only the PS2 ahead of that. And despite the hardware decline, S1 software forecasts have gone up by 20 million to 125 million. More positive news for Nintendo's accountants.</p>
<p>Games-wise, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle worked wonders (with most people presumably avoiding the $80 standalone price), with 9.57 million copies of the game out there as of 30th September. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold 3.49 million units to date. Not Mario Kart numbers, but healthy for a non-bundled release; around a third of all Switch 2 owners also have a copy of DKB. It's never going to trouble MKW's current, colossal 92% attach rate, but the ape is holding his own.</p>
<figure data-uuid="931c4e78e3c32"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/931c4e78e3c32/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>High prices and uncertainty in the US made it a tricky launch; with Microsoft and Sony increasing hardware prices this year, Nintendo had a tricky needle to thread with its pricing. But despite the hashtags and general dismay at an $80 Mario Kart — at present, Nintendo's only non-NS2 Edition game at that price point — and increased accessory costs, the numbers speak for themselves. They threaded that needle well enough.</p>
<p>The system could have been rushed out last year, but again, holding back and stockpiling hardware to satisfy demand has paid dividends, with the ball rolling nicely over the summer months. Despite industry trends and suboptimal circumstances, Nintendo has proved that the market is still there, the appetite still healthy. People <em>are</em> still willing to pay for quality. The slow and steady approach has paid off. The strategy is working.</p>
<p>The third-party support has been excellent, too. Sure, multiplatform gamers may have played a lot of these games before, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> discontent is real, but looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">the best games on Switch 2 so far</a>, 'old' games or otherwise, the quality is undeniable.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ecc82dfd0fd1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ecc82dfd0fd1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wider problems with the games industry surround us still. While PS5 is selling well, Sony's hardly had the most exciting generation, benefiting as Microsoft lurches between <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/price-increases-are-never-fun-for-anybody-says-xbox-exec-defending-game-pass-changes">PR disasters</a> and makes Xbox a less viable option by the day. Price increases across the board, however, seem to be making the value proposition of gaming hardware and subscription services worse all the time.</p>
<p>Yet here's Nintendo putting out a little tablet console that, against the odds, is tracking very favourably with its trailblazing predecessor. Switch 2 certainly isn't cheap, and it's arguably still lacking its truly killer app, its 'I <em>must</em> own a Switch 2 to play Game X!' Mario Kart was a great opening salvo. Bananza is brilliant, but it's not a Mario. Switch 2 doesn't have its Breath of the Wild yet. (In fact, you could argue that, weirdly, Switch 2's BOTW <em>is</em> BOTW, but that's another article.)</p>
<p>What it does offer, though, has been enough for more-than-enough people. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">The launch had its stresses</a>, but Nintendo has maintained the momentum beyond that opening month and is very well-placed to get stuck in over the holidays and into the new year with a packed and varied lineup. Next quarter's results — the October-November-December crop — will include figures for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>.</p>
<p>That's four brand new games, including two S2 exclusives, and we already know that Pokémon had a monster-sized launch, scoring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-scored-us-biggest-physical-game-launch-since-totk">the US' biggest physical launch since</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Packed, varied, and super effective indeed - and that's just the first-party-published stuff.</p>
<figure data-uuid="41c00c3939cc3"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41c00c3939cc3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few months, I've pondered if peppering umpteen NS2 Edition upgrades between its brand new S2 exclusives would be enough to get people on board and sufficiently excited to splash out on a pricey console, despite the pent-up desire for something new. For all the buzz, the next Animal Crossing is, well, the 'old' Animal Crossing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">with some Bells and whistles</a>. Will that be enough? Will the inevitable 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Hyper Fighting Dash Dojo EX' keep this ball rolling?</p>
<p>All evidence points to 'Yes, absolutely.' Well played, Nintendo.</p>
