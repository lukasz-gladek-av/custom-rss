<figure><a title="switch 2 battery poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31fdc712f2c15/switch-2-battery-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With gamers across the globe now settling in to put their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles through their paces, we've been seeing a bunch of media outlets, alongside eager social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">Reddit</a> users, report in on how they're finding the battery life thus far.</p>
<p>For full transparency, we've yet to run a rigorous battery test here at Nintendo Life, but from this writer's personal experience it's taking around the two-hour mark roughly, to drain things right down whilst playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Our editor, Gavin, is getting about the same running <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>, too.</p>
<p>This may be disappointing, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-how-does-it-compare">it falls pretty much in-line with what we expected</a> given Nintendo's officially indicated <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">2-6 hours</a> estimates and roughly the same as Switch 1 (before it saw a few model revisions).</p>
<p>Gamers online are reporting roughly the same figures in some cases. However, there seems to be a growing number of folk saying that they aren't even managing to reach the magic 2-hour mark whilst playing bigger games.</p>

<p>Of course, with the fact Mario Kart World is such a big, beautiful, online sort of deal, we expect the battery to drain faster, but it's not great news to see that, in some scenarios, people apparently aren't getting two hours out of it.</p>
<p>What's more (and we can confirm this one), the battery in standby mode — when you've set your Switch 2 down for the evening — seems to be draining seriously quickly in some cases. It seems it goes from a full charge to 59% on some consoles doing this, (as it has done with mine left overnight).</p>

<p>Judging from some of the responses to the post above, there are a whole bunch of players who are finding that the battery is draining too quickly for their liking. Obviously, there are a lot of factors at work here; screen brightness, downloads running in the background, whether you're using GameChat, and so on, but there's a pattern of complaints developing.</p>
<p>We'll be carrying out some tests of our own and will return with our own official findings in due course. But, in the interim, we'd love to hear how you have found the battery so far. How's it been for Mario Kart? What about 'smaller' games? And, if you've had time to take note, how does the battery do whilst in rest mode?</p>



<hr>
<p><em>And make sure to let us know all about your experiences with the Switch 2 battery in the comments. Are some games giving you better results?</em></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-fast-fusion-switch-2-the-most-accomplished-entry-yet-and-a-visual-showcase.1210986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156605/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of my favourite memories from the Switch 1 came from those opening few weeks following the launch in March 2017. Like everyone else, I was utterly glued to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, but I also poured a huge amount of time into Shin’en Multimedia’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. It was <em>the</em> game to showcase what the console was capable of in those early days, and the developer is back again with a launch title for Switch 2: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion.</a></p>
<p>Now, I know everybody has quite rightly been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> almost non-stop since the Switch 2 launched, but I’d be lying if I said it was my favourite racing game at launch (and no, it’s not <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> either). That honour goes to Fast Fusion. While somewhat slight in terms of content, this entry is the most accomplished yet, with astonishing visuals, rock-solid performance, and blisteringly fast racing.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's extremely familiar to Fast RMX veterans. You still race around tracks against CPU opponents while phasing between red and blue colours to benefit from boost pads on the ground. Picking up little energy orbs fills your boost meter, while pressing ‘R’ gives you a significant (albeit short) speed burst, quickly depleting your boost supply.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156604/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so good, then. The biggest change with the core gameplay is the ability to jump at any point. Honestly, when I first heard about this, I thought Shin’en had lost its marbles. Jumping? In a futuristic, high-speed racer? Madness! It turns out, however, that it works wonderfully well, adding an extra layer of strategy.</p>
<p>I should clarify that when I say ‘jump’, I’m not talking about the measly hop you might see in Mario Kart. Fast Fusion's jumps launch your vehicle meters into the air, giving you time to control your direction before landing. This has multiple uses: you can either use it to cross a deadly gap on the course, reach energy orbs way up high, or swap to an adjacent road to avoid obstacles or make use of a boost pad.</p>
<p>It’s got loads of potential, and I even noticed a few moments in which I could cut corners or discover hidden shortcuts. Granted, there’s nothing quite like the astonishing feats seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/f-zero_x">F-Zero X</a>, but I reckon it’s possible to cut your times dramatically once you master the mechanic. You can also use it to land on top of your enemies, spinning them out and netting you some sweet cash. Very satisfying.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156603/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the tracks themselves, you've got a total of 12 split across 4 different leagues. It's definitely a step down from previous games, but the quality on display here is insane. The torrential rain and tornadoes in Tempesta are a real visual treat, and the gigantic robots stomping around Port Genkai can do a number on you. It's thrilling stuff, and with Shin'en confirming that free content updates are on the way, we're optimistic that there'll be additional tracks in the future.</p>
<p>Outside of races, the big change here is — as the title suggests — the ability to fuse vehicles to create completely new ones. You’ve only got a few unlocked from the start, but you can tinker with the fusion mechanic straight away, provided you have the currency. It’s simply a case of selecting which vehicle you want to alter and browsing the rest of the catalogue.</p>
<p>Completing the fusion results in a mash-up of both the designs and names. You’ll also see that some of the stats have been altered depending on your chosen vehicles’ strengths. Blending Cebra Genetics with Vasp Optics, for example, yields increased boost performance thanks to the latter’s strength in that department. There are loads of different combinations you can try out, and it’s a joy to see what kind of stunning monstrosity you can come up with; you may even find you can completely max out your acceleration or top speed.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156597/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fusing does, however, cost money; in fact, everything in this game costs money. Not real money, before you grab your pitchforks, but in-game currency obtained by competing in races, performing well, and collecting items. You’ll need moolah to unlock new vehicles, complete fusions, and open up new Championship cups. The game is pretty generous with its cash prizes, but I felt deflated a couple of times realising I had to replay tracks I’d already won to grind the required funds.</p>
<p>Once you get over that initial hump of unlocking every track, however, accumulating currency is pretty painless, and you’ll find that playing races for the sheer thrill of it will soon result in heaps of the stuff. Another good way to spend it is via the Jukebox feature. Fast Fusion contains some awesome new music, and you can unlock it to listen to whenever you like, along with a whole bunch of tracks from Fast RMX, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/fast_racing_neo">FAST Racing NEO</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/fast_racing_league">Fast Racing League</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard Championship mode, you’ve also got Time Attack and Super Hero Mode. The former is pretty self-explanatory, requiring you to beat the stages’ record time, while the latter is about as close as we’re likely to get to a new F-Zero. The stages are mirrored, and your boost bar also represents your ship's health. Boost too much (or crash out entirely) and it’s game over. Generally, you’re able to boost much more than in the standard Championship mode, but it also comes with that thrilling risk vs. reward structure that makes F-Zero so great.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156609/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And of course, you’ve got multiplayer, offered up via standard splitscreen play (up to four players) or the new GameShare capabilities (two players). Splitscreen works phenomenally well with performance maintained at a solid 60fps for all. It’s not often you get such robust performance with local multiplayer these days, so seeing the Switch 2 handle this without breaking a sweat is a joy.</p>
<p>GameShare is similarly impressive in terms of performance, though being the second player on a Switch 1 does yield some pretty fuzzy visuals thanks to the streaming involved. The whole screen also shrinks slightly for both players to provide the necessary GameShare information at the top. It’s not a huge deal, and you’re going to find the same happens if you’re using the screen-share feature during GameChat, but it’s worth noting all the same.</p>
<p>While on the subject of performance, it’s worth just stressing how incredibly beautiful Fast Fusion is on the Switch. In docked mode, if you have a TV capable of hitting 4K resolution, nailing that 4K/60fps balance is absolutely magical. Shin’en Multimedia has stated its desire to potentially add in a 120fps mode at a later date, but honestly, if this means dipping the resolution down to 1080p, I’m perfectly happy sticking to 4K/60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156611/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>As for the other performance modes, you’ve got ‘Ultra Quality’ in docked mode that boosts the visuals slightly, but brings the performance down to 30fps. It’s fine, and the added texture details and shadow maps are certainly noticable, but it's not my go-to option.</p>
<p>Handheld mode delivers more or less the same, maxing out at the screen’s 1080p display while offering up the option of either a 60fps performance mode or a 30fps quality mode. The latter again offers the same visual upgrades as docked mode, but the compromises to attain this aren’t really worth it.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fast Fusion may not have the most comprehensive collection of tracks, but it's easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far. The new jump ability adds a new layer of strategy to the gameplay, while experimenting with the fusion mechanic to find the perfect vehicle is a joy. The occasional grinding to save up money can be a momentary drag, but if you're after something a bit more 'hardcore' than Mario Kart World, Fast Fusion is a no-brainer, and an absolute must-buy.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Attack Vector - A Modular Switch 2 Case Which Aims For Comfort Over Protection 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fdf76c49e119/review-genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-aims-for-comfort-over-protection-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory maker Genki has a whole host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/genki-unleashes-some-slick-new-switch-2-accessories">Switch 2 accessories</a> on the market to support the console's launch, and the excellently named <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector-pre-order?variant=42025271623754">Attack Vector</a> is one of the ones which caught my attention from the get-go.</p>
<p>Described by Genki (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/accessory-manufacturer-genki-responds-to-nintendos-switch-2-lawsuit">which is currently in Nintendo's bad books</a>) as a "modular grip case for serious handheld command", the Attack Vector comes in three different parts. The main bodywork clips onto your Switch 2 console, while the other two pieces bolt onto your Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p>
<p>On a basic level, these are designed to offer slimline protection for your shiny new purchase, but in reality, they're nowhere near substantial enough to prevent damage from severe drops; you might avoid scratching or marking the Switch 2, but that's about it.</p>

<p>The three-piece modular design means you can remove your Joy-Con 2 when you want to, and the main part of the case is so thin it doesn't prevent you from docking the Switch 2, which is a plus. The rear of the case also supports snap-on accessories thanks to a small MagSafe-style magnetic section; this is handy for clipping on plug-in external battery packs, for example (naturally, Genki has its own option here, called the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/energy-pack-pre-order">Energy Pack</a>).</p>
<p>However, by far the most interesting element of the Attack Vector is the trio of swappable grips that bolt onto the back of the Joy-Con 2 sections of the case. The smallest set ("Feather") gives you small bumps to grip onto, while the most pronounced pair ("Anchor") is pretty huge but provides the most agreeable ergonomic experience. The "Balance" set is somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. To be honest, with the exception of the "Feather" set (which doesn't really seem to make a huge difference), the other two grips are excellent and really do make the Switch 2 more comfortable to play for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>The grips have a rubberised texture, so they're super-tactile, and there are "sweat-resistant bands" (according to Genki) that mean they don't get slippy when the action heats up.</p>

<p>Prior to getting my Switch 2 this week, I've been playing an awful lot on my <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/steam-deck-oled-the-best-just-got-better">Steam Deck OLED</a>, and I have to admit the ergonomics of that device are a <em>lot</em> better than Nintendo's new hybrid console. However, with the Attack Vector installed, the difference is less obvious.</p>
<p>It's a shame, then, that some elements of Genki's modular case let it down. As previously mentioned, the Attack Vector feels very flimsy, and there's a lot of flex and movement in the main case, even when it's clipped onto the Switch 2 itself. While the Joy-Con 2 grips are great for improving overall ergonomics, it feels like they add extra 'pivot' to the controllers. I actually think the magnets which hold the Joy-Con 2 to the Switch 2 are great, but I have never been so aware that they are separate components than when I used the Attack Vector. The amount of 'wobble' you feel during use is pretty extreme.</p>
<p>This complaint aside, I actually found myself liking the Attack Vector case. It's pretty expensive for what essentially amounts to three sections of thin plastic, but the swappable grips are genuinely useful, and having a trio of size options means you're almost sure to find the grip that suits you. It's just a shame that more robust protection isn't part of the package.</p>



<p><em>The Genki Attack Vector is available directly from the manufacturer and costs <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector-pre-order?variant=42025271623754">$49.99 / £42</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>What a shock, what a horror, I’ll be spending my weekend playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. What a quirky little individual I am, eh? You know what else I’ll be playing? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>. Why? Because it’s sweet! On top of all that, I’m fighting the urge to replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> in its entirety because it looks so gosh darn pretty now, and I finally have the excuse that I’ve been looking for to dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it’s also my Granny’s birthday, so I’ll be squeezing in all of that around some nice family time. Busy weekend for old Jimmy!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Of course I'm playing the Switch 2, come on now. I've not quite been suckered into Mario Kart World yet, so I'm mostly bouncing between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. The latter is an absolute marvel in handheld mode. It's hard to believe I'm playing something of such high quality while sat on the bog.</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Mario Kart World! Fast Fusion! Mario Kart World! Cyberpunk 2077! Mario Kart World! Street Fighter VI! Mario Kart World! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>! ...did I mention Mario Kart World?</p>
<p>But I ain’t packing in my Switch 1 just yet, I still need to transfer several virtual game cards from it to the Switch 2. The future is a bit confusing, but it does work. Plus I also got my physical copy of <strong>Sonic Wings Reunion</strong>, so plenty of life left on the old eight-year-old system. Wow, was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> really this great in its arcade debut?</p>
<p>Game of the Week is… being alive and a part of this exciting time in the industry. For all you folks out there who did not manage to secure a Switch 2 already due to reasons, please don’t give up on your dreams and enjoy video games in any way you can.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'll be playing more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i</a>. I know, I wrote a whole review — but this is one of those 250-hour games, and I have a lot more grinding to do to get up to Hero rank on all the Lives!</p>
<p>I'm also making my own game. Does that count? I've had a lot of stops and starts, because every one of my game ideas ends up petering out when I get to the hard part (spoilers: it's UI) but this time I'm also learning the programming aspect, rather than just relying on my partner to do it. I'm noodling around in Love2D, if anyone wants to know!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I really, really want to play Mario Kart and Cyberpunk, but I've got to power on through Welcome Tour for review - keep your eyes peeled for that soon. Beyond that, I'm gagging to start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vruJnZDxpMw">Felix's Odyssey comparison</a> has me jonesing to replay it on S2.</p>

<p>Forge swords and unbreakable bonds this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco and Brownies have today revealed the new roguelite action title <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/towa_and_the_guardians_of_the_sacred_tree">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It will be making its way to the Switch on <strong>19th September 2025</strong> and includes melodies from Hitsoshi Sakimoto (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy</a>). You can check out the new trailer above and here's some PR (via Bandai Namco):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this roguelite-RPG adventure set in a far-off mystic realm, ancient forces stir, and untold dangers await.</p>
<p>As Towa, lead the guardians of the sacred tree in forging strong relationships and powerful swords to fight Magatsu’s forces and determine the future of Shinju Village.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>Enter a vibrant world filled with beauty and perilous danger.</p>
<p>On your quest to restore peace, play as Towa and the Guardians as they explore far-off lands threatened by Magatsu’s evil influence. In a world where even splendor hides a lurking threat, courage is the only way forward.</p>
<p>As Hitoshi Sakimoto’s melodies guide the way, a breathtaking yet untamed landscape unfolds where the fight to save Shinju Village begins.</p>
<p>Towa, priestess of Shinju, stands united with 8 trustworthy companions to defeat Magatsu.<br>
Fight alongside a fellow guardian and wield the power of the sacred sword (Tsurugi) and staff (Kagura). Each guardian has its own abilities and sets of swords, making each combat style and guardian pair unique.</p>
<p>Together, pave your way through colorful lands, conquer dungeons, and defeat Magatsu’s minions!</p>
<p>As the guardians pursue their quests across different timelines, the village evolved over the years.</p>
<p>Develop unique bonds with its residents and learn more about their customs and stories that are woven into the inner workings of the village.</p>
<p>Each visit is a chance to train at the dojo, summon powerful Graces, and craft new swords at the smithing shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brownies, in case you didn't know, is the studio led by former founders of Brownie Brown (now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio) - who originally worked on the Mana series for Square Enix back in the day as well as titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother 3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/sword_of_mana">Sword of Mana</a>.</p>

<p>Mads Mikkelsen from Casino Royale returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hitman's developer IO Interactive has been busy this week with not only the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> but also the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination</a> on the Switch 2. In the leadup to its new James Bond game, the developer has now lifted the lid on its 'Casino Royale' crossover.</p>
<p>This will bring the 007 villain Le Chiffre (aka the award-winning actor Mads Mikkelsen) to the world of Hitman in a new "celebrity elusive target mission". You can see the trailer for this free content above, and it's available from now until <strong>6th July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>IO Interactive also plans to develop a co-op mode for Hitman World of Assassination with more information about this to be shared at a "later date".</p>
<p>This latest update from IO Interactive once again follows the official reveal of 007 First Light, which is currently targeting a 2026 launch window. If you play this Hitman update, you'll also unlock an exclusive suit for 007 First Light.</p>
<p>If you're curious to know more about the Switch 2 version of Hitman, our review is now live here on Nintendo Life. This package brings together the "best" of three titles including the main campaign and much more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, all life hangs in the balance… To face this threat, She-Hulk forgoes litigation and takes matters into her own hands; get ready to grapple and toss enemies around with her gamma-powered might! And if you’re more into firepower, blast your way through a barrage of bugs with Rocket Raccoon and his hard-hitting futuristic arsenal! With his penchant for sporadically lobbing grenades, you’re looking at MARVEL Cosmic Invasion’s most chaotic fighter yet.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>Get ready to brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat!</p>
