<p>After a few lengthy delays, the tactical RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> has finally secured a final release date for the Switch, and you've not got long to wait. As announced during the Indie World Japan showcase, the Necrosoft Games-developed title will launch on <strong>3rd September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The game is influenced by the likes of <strong>Persona</strong> and <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong>, along with – and this is brilliant – italian horror cinema..? <em>Excuse</em> me?! So cool. Plenty of footage has already been made available through trailers and gameplay showcases, so if you haven't checked out Demonschool yet, then definitely take a peek when you can. It looks awesome.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's nice to finally get a proper release date, and it sounds like Necrosoft's Brandon Sheffield is equally relieved, stating "“At long last, Demonschool is finally coming out. It's been a long road but we're through certification and ready to go. We really put a lot of ourselves into this thing and now the future of Demonschool is in your hands. We truly hope you will enjoy it."</p>
<p>We hope so too!</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/fifteen-years-in-the-making-caves-of-qud-is-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-year</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fifteen-years-in-the-making-caves-of-qud-is-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-year.1264536/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Kitfox Games and Freehold Games have announced that <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a></strong> is finally on its way to Switch via a Q4 2025 release. That's not even very far away!</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of the game before, Caves of Qud is a game that spent a whopping 15 years in development and early access on PC, before releasing on that platform in December of last year to some outrageously gushing reviews.</p>
<p>We're looking at a retro-styled roguelike that's apparently got all of the goods here. Enough to make it a standout in one of the most oversaturated genres of all time, even. Wow. It certainly looks unique, with some fairly busy visuals that meld retro gaming chic with what looks like root directories from your dad's old PC. The good stuff, in short. You can also tell by the barmy text on-screen, and tons of lore at every turn, that there's a depth to the world you'll blast through.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer above, and we'll leave you with some further details about the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? Do anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p>
<p><strong>DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION</strong> — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</p>
<p><strong>FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES</strong> — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</p>
<p><strong>DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM</strong> — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING</strong> — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</p>
<p><strong>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</strong> — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</p>
<p><strong>RPG ELEMENTS</strong> — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</p>
<p><strong>Play one of four modes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLASSIC</strong> — Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.<br>
<strong>ROLEPLAY</strong> — Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.<br>
<strong>WANDER</strong> — Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.<br>
<strong>DAILY</strong> — One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get to your ships!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arcade_archives_d-day">D-Day</a>, Jaleco's 1984 arcade shooter, will arrive today on Nintendo Switch as part of Arcade Archives. The game, which this writer remembers quite enjoying back in ye olden days, sees players control a warship as it sails right up the screen, shooting down planes and blowing everything to ribbons as it goes.</p>
<p>Players have a selection of two weapons, and the little reticles on the screen, that you can see in the trailer above, pertain to each of these. Now, there was another D-Day game, in fact there have been a few, but this is the vertical shooter one, not the 1985 strategy game (which was impossibly difficult).</p>
<p>Watching the above trailer, we're also brought back to the wonderful world of mid-80s era arcade tunes and sound effects. A cacophony of ill-fitting music and incredibly loud beeps, boops and blasts await any soldiers brave enough to take on the challenge. The longest day, indeed.</p>
<p>Here's some more details and pics from the official press material:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"D-DAY" is a shooter released by JALECO in 1984.<br>
Your mission is to pilot your battleship, fending off enemy battleships and bombers, and destroy the enemy fortress.<br>
Today is the day the operation is to take place. The longest day begins...</p>

<p>50 games in one</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, Mossmouth's critically-acclaimed retro compilation, <strong>UFO 50</strong>, is out on Switch... <strong>today</strong>! The game costs <strong>$24.99 / £20.99</strong> on the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>Announced during today's Indie World showcase, the game was developers by the creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/downwell">Downwell</a>, and <strong>Catacomb Kids</strong>. We've been itching to try this one out for a while, and now we don't have to wait any longer. <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/ufo-50">Fangamer will also be handling a physical version</a> of the game, and pre-orders are live now for $35.99 for the standard version, or $49.99 for the Deluxe (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvsu2wkil627">Wario64</a>!)</p>
<p>This isn't a <strong>WarioWare</strong>-type situation with tons of minigames — this is a full-on collection of 50 different games, all ready to play from the beginning. Essentially, the entire game is about a fictional video game company from the 80s called UFO Soft, and you can chart the development history of that company in-game.</p>
<p>There are sequels, stand-alone titles, multiple different genres, and a handful of multiplayer and co-op games too.</p>

<p>We got to try the game very briefly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-every-nintendo-switch-game-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024">at Summer Game Fest in 2024</a> and, while we only spent around 10 minutes and got to try a handful of in-game titles, we were absolutely charmed.</p>
<p>We know what we're playing tonight!</p>

<p>Underwater future slaughter</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Playism and Studio Snowblind have announced <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/glaciered">Glaciered</a></strong> for Switch 2, with a release date of winter 2025.</p>
<p>The game, which is apparently inspired by the rich ecosystems of Hokkaido, Japan, and looks a little like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, but with underwater hand-to-hand combat (good thing), sees players assume control of Twi, a dinosaur descendant who's fighting for survival in a futuristic deep sea.</p>
<p>Twi can equip lots of different gear, and upgrade through various levels to grow stronger as they fend off all manner of very bizarre-looking ocean threats. We expect there are gonna be some fairly freaky big beasties to fight down the line in this one.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for the game above, and we'll leave you with a few screens. We'll also be sure to update you with more info on this one as it arrives.</p>
