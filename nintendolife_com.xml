<p>Its Metacritic user score drops to 7.5</p>

<figure><a title="MK World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4407c0e8e83ba/mk-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following Nintendo's most recent update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, it seems a small minority of fans are expressing their disappointment in the only way they know how: by review bombing the game on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-kart-world/user-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-kart-world-review-bombing-metacritic-user-score-plummeting/">The Gamer</a>, Mario Kart World's user review average has dropped from around 8.3 to 7.5 in just a handful of days (and its also worth noting that The Gamer had it at 7.7 just a couple of days ago, so the score is still dropping as we speak).</p>
<p>Nintendo's recent update made it much harder for online players to randomly select standard 3-lap courses, instead putting more emphasis on the so-called 'intermission' races that make use of the game's new open world. 3-lap courses are still available, but the probability of them showing up is now much lower.</p>
<p>A lot of fans still value the traditional 3-lap races, so we can understand the frustration to a certain degree, but we're not sure reviewing the game and awarding it a score of... hang on... yep, <em>0/10</em> is the right answer. Hey, if it gets Nintendo to listen, then fair play – maybe that's the goal.</p>
<p>We've no doubt Mario Kart World will continue to receive updates way into the future, and we're confident Nintendo will ultimately provide enough options to keep all fans happy and content. For now, however, its decisions are definitely leading some to vent their anger online. One video even said that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fans-reckon-nintendo-has-killed-mario-kart-world-with-its-latest-update">Nintendo had "killed" the game with the latest update</a>. Yikes.</p>
<figure><a title="MK World - Metacritic" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c213943886b0/mk-world-metacritic.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-kart-world/user-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the controversy, we still think Mario Kart World is a pretty darn good game. We awarded it a score of 9/10 and said it "refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others".</p>

<figure><a title="DS2 / Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8985775b44f3a/ds2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK Charts are here, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> has comfortably landed at number one following its debut, pushing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> down to second place for the first time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, however, it seems physical sales for DS2 are down 66% when compared to the first game, according to The Game Business' <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1939386768211509434">Chris Dring</a>. It's a much different world we live in now, of course, so it's likely that there are simply far more digital sales this time around.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Nightdive Studios' excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thing_remastered">The Thing: Remastered</a> made its charts debut at number seven following its recent physical release, and if you've not checked out that game yet, we'd highly recommend doing so. The physical sold way better on the PS5, admittedly, which isn't entirely surprising given that it benefits from a buttery-smooth 120fps on Sony's platform.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

<p>Iizuka once again shuts it down</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Sonic Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bfbacd740607e/sonic-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're still grasping onto the idea of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_dx_directors_cut">Sonic Adventure</a> remaster in this here year 2025, then it might be time to put such hopes to rest, because it sounds like Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka simply isn't interested in the idea.</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVxhI6H5C_I">Shack News</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/aw-nah-this-aint-happenin-sega-on-potential-ps5-sonic-adventure-remasters">Push Square</a>) Iizuka said he acknowledges the requests from fans, but ultimately believes that the time required to bring Sonic Adventure up to modern standards would simply be better spent on creating a completely new title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>I do hear [the requests for a Sonic Adventure remaster] a lot. I really am appreciative for everyone who likes the Sonic Adventure series, but when I think about what it would take to kind of bring that game up to the standards and expectations of what the modern gaming audience would want, I think it would be about as much time and energy as it would to make a new title.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0itynsx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
<p><em>"Part of me is thinking maybe I should just make a brand new title and that’s why there’s currently no plans.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it's important to note that Iizuka has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/sega-co-takashi-iizuka-expresses-interest-in-a-new-sonic-adventure-game">previously expressed interest in returning to the 'Sonic Adventure' sub-series</a>, but it seems far more likely that we'd see a hypothetical Sonic Adventure 3 than a remaster or remake of the previous two entries.</p>
<p>And y'know what, we're totally okay with that. As much as we love the Adventure games, they definitely represent Sonic Team's first proper foray into the realm of 3D Sonic, and uhh... yeah, you can tell. We'd probably rather Sonic Team take what it learned with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> and make a new, even better experience for fans.</p>
<p>We wouldn't say no to a Switch port, though. Just a port, y'know? Surely that's feasible, right?</p>

<p>It's the end of June and, once again, I'm lamenting that I haven't spent more time with Switch games. This happens every year, but that kind of statement sounds even more ridiculous when you've played a lot of remakes and remasters and spent over 100 hours on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty</a> each, right?</p>
<p>There's another game that is going to join that elusive 100+ club, <em>and</em> I'm head over heels in love with it. I knew what I was getting into with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> (I never played the 3DS one), but I've sat down multiple times and lost <em>hours</em> just by doing stuff. It's a game that was made in a laboratory specifically for me, and I'm scared for my free time.</p>
<p>Something a <em>little</em> more condensed that I ended up adoring is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</a>. I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Lilies</a> and it back-to-back and the sequel is a huge step up; the movement and control options are divine, the combat is more polished, the bosses are extremely fun, and the map is excellent. It's an almost-perfect concoction of Metroidvania ingredients.</p>

<p>Since we found out that Switch 2 might give old games a performance bump, I found myself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-are-you-ghosting-switch-1-to-save-yourself-for-switch-2">ghosting the console</a> to an extent, sitting tight until the successor dropped and I could bathe in the super smooth frame rates and 'silent' updates that sees Switch 1 games reach their full potential. And now it's here!... and I'm predictably buried under Switch 2 games now (several of which are excellent, but they'll get their props from other people here).</p>
<p>Yep, I've gone and curtailed my S1 sampling quite a bit having dipped back into various Wii games — Hi, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a>! Hi, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/excite_truck">Excite Truck</a>! Hi, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rhythm_heaven_fever">Rhythm Heaven Fever</a>! — in recent months, but I'd like to give a shoutout to two games at different ends of the size spectrum: Xenoblade Chronicles X, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/please_touch_the_artwork_2">Please, Touch The Artwork 2</a>.</p>
<p>The former got its due acclaim at launch, and while I'm only (!) maybe a dozen hours in, it took that long to really click with me, and I'm now gagging to return and finish it off. The latter is a minnow (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/please-touch-the-artwork-2">which I reviewed</a>, in fact) and while it's not an earth-shaker, it deserves a mention here at the very least as a great little amuse-bouche among the obvious titans.</p>
<p>Oh, and while we're on games I reviewed, I'll give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> a nod, too. From the tone of coverage elsewhere, it's hard to understand what some people expected from it (and backlash to the pricing is an obvious factor), but from my perspective? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">As I said,</a> it's like an Iwata Asks interview in interactive form; I don't see how anyone who's ever enjoyed one of those could dislike it! As ever, different strokes.</p>

<h2>It's definitive (Gonçalo Lopes, contributor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77e55219e37d6/xenoblade-chronicles-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hardware transition years are always a tricky thing mostly because there shouldn't be that many exciting things going on with Switch until the inevitable deluge of games on Switch 2 starts to drop. So I feel like a bit of a cheat, but my GOTY so far is Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition.</p>
<p>That’s right, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/xenoblade_chronicles_x">decade old game</a> (which of course was my GOTY 2015) that brings so many quality-of-life upgrades and a brand new three-part final chapter that wraps up the plot in an extremely pleasant way put every other Nintendo release on the first half of 2025 to shame.</p>
<p>I’m quite looking forward to see what Nintendo has in store for the rest of the year because I suspect my GOTY 2025 is still somewhere down the line (perhaps the adventures of a certain intergalactic bounty hunter or a very strong ape and teenage adopted daughter?). But the industry taught me that better hardware does not always equal better games and despite the original release age, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition definitely left a huge impression in yours truly.</p>
<h2>Citizen, weeper (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d31b73cde5920/citizen-sleeper-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've polished off quite a few games so far this year, but very few of them have actually come out of 2025 — backlog? Never heard of it! One that did release in the last six months, mind you, and absolutely <em>destroyed</em> me was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>.</p>
<p>I missed out on the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> by having too much on my plate at the time, but my love for TTRPGs made me ever so curious about its follow-up, and <em>oh my gosh</em>, my investment was off the charts. The writing is incredible, the music is phenomenal, and the final act left me snot-crying on the corner of the sofa while my partner frantically tried to work out what a 'Sleeper' was and whether she needed to make me breathe into a paper bag.</p>
<p>You can play CS2 however you'd like to, so there's no guarantee that your robo-pal would go through the same arc mine did. That said, I challenge anyone to spend a few hours with this colourful cast of characters and <em>not</em> quickly develop a crew that you'd be willing to die for. Just superb stuff, and if it's <em>not</em> on my GOTY list come December, we'll have had a <em>very</em> good second half.</p>
<h2>Life's a fantasy (Kate Gray, contributor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e0e4e2f96439/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have a lot of GOTY candidates already, which means it's been a fantastic year, but I think my frontrunner for the time being is <strong>Fantasy Life i</strong>.</p>
<p>I gave it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">a 9 in my review</a>, and they actually FIXED one of my main issues (the farming), so if anything, it's even better now! It's a worthy successor to the original, and it's, like, three entire games stuffed into one. I don't always like an overstuffed game that tries to be everything, but FLi pulls it off extremely well.</p>
<h2>Robots and time travel (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/929694b09c46f/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: XSEED</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It would have been lovely to list a bunch of Switch 2 titles here, but alas, as good as the new console's launch line-up has proven to be, none of them will ultimately make my GOTY list for 2025.</p>
<p>There's one clear winner for me (which I suspect you might have already guessed), but I want to give a shoutout to two titles that came <em>very</em> close to taking an early lead. The first is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot</a>, a magnificent arcade remake from the minds of Llamasoft's Jeff Minter and Ivan 'Giles' Zorzin that sunk its psychedelic claws into me right from the start. It's such a unique experience, and one that probably won't appeal to everyone, but once it 'clicks', it's <em>really</em> hard to put down.</p>
<p>The second is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>. I'll be honest, I've barely touched the likes of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/power_stone_2">Power Stone 2</a> and <strong>Project Justice</strong>, but my goodness, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001</a> has me in a chokehold. Its wealth of options is almost overwhelming at first, but I love tinkering with the different grooves and seeing which one speaks to me the most. What an excellent fighter.</p>
<p>But of course, the true winner here is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. I go into much greater detail in my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-not-enough-people-are-talking-about-this-early-goty-contender">recent feature piece</a>, but in a nutshell, it's a game that just keeps on surprising and delighting long after you roll credits. Its characters are incredibly memorable, and although I'm not much of a strategy fan, the combat proved to be consistently compelling throughout.</p>
<h2>Master swords and anti-grav racing FTW (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Fast Fusion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb139ecfbb8bf/fast-fusion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Shin'en</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, and maybe surprisingly — or not — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> doesn't stand a chance of a look-in for me here, as great as it is. Instead, besides retrying every game I own to see which ones play better whilst my sons mock me and call me "bald nerd man", I've found myself absolutely bloody engrossed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> all over again.</p>
<p>Now, I sort of blasted through it really, really quickly on a (borrowed) Wii U when it first came out, so I hightailed it through a whole lot of things, and did very little side stuff. What this led to was a Master Sword-less playthrough (I'm not sure I even started the quest to get it in the forest). What's more, I scaled the outside of Hyrule Castle at the end to save time, like a big Irish ninja, going straight into the boss battle from the balcony of the room involved, if I remember correctly. And boy did I give that bad guy a walloping, by the way.</p>
<p>I sure did save a lot of time doing it thusly, but it's irked me ever since. Now though, having tried a few new runs and then ditched it on Switch, this Switch 2 edition has done the trick. I'm fully back in, one Divine Beast down already and I'm 100% gonna see it all this time. So yeah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, to answer the question, with all its fancy new bells and whistles and sexy frame rates.</p>
<p>I'll also give a shoutout to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, which I'm enjoying way more than Mario's brand of racing right now. It really does pack some depth for racers who push it into the higher difficulties, and may well actually be my favourite anti-grav racer outside of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/wipeout_3">Wipeout</a> series now, and definitely replaces <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/redout">Redout</a> as my fave on Switch consoles. It's so fast, Ricky Bobby!</p>

<p>Last time, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_konga_2_hit_song_parade">Donkey Konga 2</a> for the GameCube; a rather lovely sequel that never quite became the hit it deserved to be. In a classic three-way brawl, Japan came out on top with 47% of the vote, but goodness, it was close. North America just missed out with 46% of the vote - oof! Europe sadly lagged behind with just 8%.</p>
<p>This week, we're feeling the excitement in the air as Capcom begins to lift the lid on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Yes, it's skipping the Switch 2, but regardless, we're thrilled to see a new entry return to the decimated landscape of Raccoon City.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0itynsx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, we're going to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_darkside_chronicles">Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a>, the Wii sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_umbrella_chronicles">The Umbrella Chronicles</a> that partially retells the events of RE2 and RE: Code Veronica. Europe and Japan share almost identical box arts this week other than very minor character placements, so we'll be grouping those two together for the sake of this battle.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:7253 @ 1751273571 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Darkside - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6a59c8757ca4/darkside-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/803-resident-evil-the-darkside-chroniclesey-konga-2">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American approach feels a bit more, shall we say, "traditional". Its got Leon and Claire front and centre, with Krauser and, uh, Leon ominously floating about in the background. It's a cool image, but honestly, we kinda wish Capcom had leaned into the 'Operation Javier' stuff a bit more. But we also understand that putting the main protagonists from RE2 smack bang in the middle will probably get more eyes on it.</p>
<h2>Europe / Japan</h2>

<p>Yes, Europe and Japan's box arts are slightly different... <em>SLIGHTLY</em>. Not enough for us though, sorry. They're basically the same, with a cool broken glass effect going on to separate the characters around the edge. It's a bit more abstract than the North American approach, and arguably better represents the segmented structure of the game itself. The lighter tones kind of remind us or the original GamCube box art for RE0 too.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-resident-evil-the-darkside-chronicles]]></content:encoded>

<p>Zion investigates</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch 2 has been out for almost a month now and while Nintendo already shared an official chart confirming the compatibility of certain Switch accessories, our American-based senior video producer Zion Grassl has now gone a step further with a video reminder.</p>
<p>He's been testing various first and third-party Switch accessories with Nintendo's new hybrid system and has now shared this handy video of what does and doesn't work on the Switch 2. There's even some stuff that <em>kind of</em> works, but still has some setbacks. If you want the full rundown, check out the video above.</p>
<p>We've also highlighted <em>some</em> of the items that will and won't work below.</p>
<p><strong>(Mostly) won't work on the Switch 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Official Nintendo Adjustable Charging Stand</li>
<li>Original Switch Dock</li>
<li>Genki Covert Dock (charging but no output)</li>
<li>MicroSD Card (will only transfer photos and video, Switch 2 uses MicroSD Express Card)</li>
<li>Switch cases, but some cases and packs can still fit a Switch 2 (PDP Sheikah Slate case, HORI adventure packs)</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch console grips (Satisfye etc)</li>
<li>Joy-Con grip holder, straps, charging standing, charging grip, and wheels do not work with Joy-Con 2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will work on Switch 2 (with a few caveats):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Original Switch Joy-Con (can't be attached to the system)</li>
<li>Original Switch Pro Controller, select Power-A Controllers, select fight sticks, Poké Ball Plus, SNES and N64 Classic Controllers (won't wake console up from sleep)</li>
<li>Joy-Con Leg Strap (Nintendo Switch Sports, Ring Fit Adventure,)</li>
<li>Ring-Con (Needs a Switch 1 Joy-Con)</li>
<li>Nintendo Labo works on Switch 2 (system tablet too big for Labo VR Goggles)</li>
<li>Switch 2 can be charged with Switch AC adapter (can't power Switch 2 Dock)</li>
<li>USB Network Adapter (use the built-in ethernet port instead)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, this is just a selection of items tested, and you can find out more about what Switch accessories will and won't work with the Switch 2 in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>A USB camera fix and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>One of the many Sega games released alongside the Switch 2 at launch was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a>.</p>
<p>Although it arguably didn't offer much for returning players, there was a new camera feature allowing you to superimpose your face during gameplay. It seems there were some display issues with "certain" USB cameras, but this now been resolved in the latest update.</p>
<p>Along with this fix are some other updates, resolving various issues. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S – Ver. 1.0.2 (27th June 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes video display problems that could affect certain USB cameras.</li>
<li>Fixes matchmaking issues that could occur with promotion battles.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes.</li>
</ul></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And in case you missed it, yes - you can use regular USB cameras with your Switch 2 to enjoy certain features in select titles. The game also includes Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>As for our thoughts on Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, we gave it six out of ten. While it's a "pretty darn decent game" the Switch 2 additions are minimal at best, and there's no upgrade path like certain other third-party releases.</p>
