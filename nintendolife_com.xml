<figure data-uuid="88f5d2778a233"><a title="Nintendo Today!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/88f5d2778a233/nintendo-today.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Stop the press, because the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app has been updated, folks.</p>
<p>Yes, the 2.1.0 patch is here, and it adds... well, a couple of things. First up, we've got a new, smaller calendar app that no longer takes up the whole ruddy home screen, so that's nice if you like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Second is a new filter that lets you streamline the news feed according to specific characters. You better believe we'll be laser-focused on anything to do with Samus for the next few weeks!</p>
<p>So let's check out the official patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Added Calendar Widget Sizes</strong></p>
<p>- Added a small widget you can use to check the weekly calendar.</p>
<p><strong>News and Browsing History Filtering</strong></p>
<p>- News and browsing history can now be filtered by character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, that's yer lot.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also recently released a separate app for its storefront, featuring games, accessories, and more. With the Nintendo Music and the Nintendo Switch apps, this is now totals four. Maybe it's time to combine these together in some way, Nintendo..?</p>

<hr>
<p>We had a great time with Grand Bazaar when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, and we were particular fans of how gosh darn charming the whole thing is: "Marvelous has really taken a lot of time to perfect the gameplay loop of Grand Bazaar, and that polish has also spilled out into the characters and the visuals."

<p>In case you missed it, the recently released game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> teased the second chapter.</p>
<p>Now, in an update via Falcom's <a href="https://www.falcom.co.jp/ir-data/20251112-1">latest financial report for September 2025</a>, the company has reportedly locked in a release window for the remake of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC – with the game scheduled to arrive by the fiscal year ending <strong>September 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/if-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-doesnt-get-a-sequel-our-fans-will-go-youve-got-to-be-kidding-me-nihon-falcom-ceo-on-future-releases/">recent interview</a>, the Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo mentioned how a remake of the second entry had to happen. Once again, here's what he had to say (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">via Push Square</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067plmwzt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If we didn’t follow up with a remake of Trails in the Sky SC, people would go, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ So, we do want to do a remake along the lines of Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/highly-anticipated-rpg-remake-trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-confirmed-for-2026-release">colleagues at Push Square also note</a>, "the second Trails in the Sky game is widely considered to be one of the franchise's best instalments. It's got a gut-punching story and some fantastic character development — alongside some of the most memorable boss encounters in the series".</p>
<p>And without getting too far ahead, Kondo has previously stated how anything beyond this (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">as in a remake of the third instalment</a>) will likely come down to "fan demand". For now, no specific platforms have been confirmed for the second chapter just yet, so when there's an official announcement, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>The 1st Chapter was released on the Switch and Switch 2 on 19th September 2025, and since then, the Switch 2 version has received some "image quality and performance settings". There's also a demo you can download from the eShop.</p>

<p>Reports suggest Version 21.0.0 borked compatibility</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="dc2f3f1430d2e"><a title="Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc2f3f1430d2e/switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might have already seen some reports claiming third-party docks are no longer compatible with the Switch 2. These stories started popping up after Nintendo rolled out a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major system update</a> earlier this week, which bumped its new hybrid device up to Version 21.0.0.</p>
<p>We've investigated this with a quick test of one of the devices we have on hand (specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/antank-s3-max-tv-dock-station-for-nintendo-switch-2-a-decent-little-travel-dock">S3 MAX TV Dock Station by Antank</a>), and it appears to be functioning as normal. It seems <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1oufk3v/switch_2_3rd_party_dock_issues_after_recent/">we might not be alone here</a>, but it's now got us wondering how it's been going for <em>other</em> third-party dock users since Nintendo rolled out the latest updates.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186280 @ 1763121943 -->
<p>Some of the advice being shared online at the moment is to hold off updating your system if you've got a third-party dock. Certain manufacturers have also issued notices advising users to avoid the latest firmware update while they work on dock fixes, and a handful of companies have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1oufk3v/comment/nokyxir/">supposedly already overcome any issues</a>. This apparently includes new updates for Hagibis, Jemdo and Jsaux-branded docks.</p>
<p>We've previously acknowledged how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-usb-c-chip-might-be-breaking-compatibility-with-third-party-docks">there could be an "ongoing battle"</a> between Nintendo and third-party dock makers, and unless it's an officially licensed product, there's always going to be a chance Nintendo could take action. And we've even seen some fans now claiming their official Switch 2 dock is now experiencing problems after this latest firmware update.</p>
<p>So, how has your Switch 2 third-party dock experience been so far? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>
