<p>Nintendo is regularly renewing its video game trademarks, and with this in mind, some trademarks have apparently been spotted for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_tri_force_heroes">The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_tennis_ultra_smash">Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash</a>.</p>
<p>The multiplayer Zelda title originally made its debut on the 3DS in 2015. We found it to be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/3ds/legend_of_zelda_tri_force_heroes">"mixed bag" compared to its illustrious predecessors</a>. As for Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, this game arrived on the Wii U in 2015. It featured <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu/mario_tennis_ultra_smash">some enjoyable gameplay</a>, but there wasn't quite enough there to keep us interested.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's a look at these trademarks <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/2007002500906279007">courtesy of Mike Odyssey on social media</a> (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/56376-nintendo-renews-for-trademarks-zelda-tri-force-heroes-and-mario-tennis-ultra-smash">thanks, GoNintendo</a>):</p>

<p>When it comes to video game trademarks, there is no guarantee games and filings spotted will neccessarily lead to an announcement or reveal.</p>
<p>For Nintendo, renewals are often just part of everyday business operations to protect its intellectual properties. In saying this, some trademark renewals from publishers in recent years have led to the revival of certain games and series, such as Bandai Namco's IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/klonoa_phantasy_reverie_series">Klonoa</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Katamari</a>.</p>
<p>If we hear anything related to these renewals, we will provide an update. Although there's no sign of Nintendo's multiplayer-focused Zelda series returning, you can always get a co-op fix in the recently released title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. A new Mario Tennis game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> is also coming to the Switch 2 next month.</p>

<p>The Hundred Line team says it will "consider" it</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="52b23e2f21658"><a title="The Hundred Line" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52b23e2f21658/the-hundred-line.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>One Switch release we didn't think enough people spoke about in 2025 was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. Fortunately, there might be a chance of it returning to the spotlight in the future.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19255-the-hundred-line-interview-kodaka-dlc-new-characters-routes-uchikoshi-switch-2">recent interview with RPG Site</a>, the title's co-director Kazutaka Kodaka mentioned how the team at Too Kyo Games would definitely consider a Switch 2 Edition upgrade, similar to what fans saw with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">SHUTEN ORDER</a> in November. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RPG Site:</strong> It made sense to prioritize Switch and Steam for this one. Are there any plans for a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade like we just saw for Shuten Order? I ask this because the game is a bit rough on Switch compared to PC and it would benefit a lot from faster loading with better visuals and performance on Switch 2.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vonxst&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p><strong>Kazutaka Kodaka:</strong> We’d like to consider that as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while there's nothing concrete just yet, there appears to be a serious chance a Switch 2 upgrade could be considered for the future.</p>
<p>When The Hundred Line originally arrived in April last year, we gave it an "excellent" nine out of ten stars and praised it for its blend of tactical RPG and visual novel gameplay. We also gave it a spot in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our Nintendo Life 2025 Games of the Year list</a>. The success it had also seemingly helped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/the-hundred-line-dev-no-longer-sees-bankruptcy-as-a-serious-future">Too Kyo Games avoid bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, the paid upgrade for Shuten Order on Switch 2 included a performance update and mouse controls.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Is Launching An Evolutionary 2x4 Smart Brick Featuring A Tiny Computer]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lego-is-launching-an-evolutionary-2x4-smart-brick-featuring-a-tiny-computer</link>
            <guid>1397929</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Lego has officially announced a new 2x4 "smart brick" at CES 2026 this week. It's apparently the "most significant evolution" in the Lego system since the release of the Minifigure in 1978 and is part of the company's "smart play" initiatives.</p>
<p>This brick, which will be featured in new Star Wars sets launching this March, is expected to expand to other sets. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854556/lego-announces-smart-brick-the-most-significant-evolution-in-50-years">According to The Verge</a>, there are supposedly already rumours about how it could be included in the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon</a> line, due out this year. So, what's all the fuss about?</p>
<p>As reported by the tech site, this is "the most ambitious brick" Lego has ever made, with a "tiny computer that fits entirely inside a classic 2x4 Lego brick". It's a custom ASIC chip and is "smaller than a single Lego stud" with firmware that can be updated via a smartphone app.</p>
<p>It's got a built-in battery that will "still perform after years of inactivity" and can be wirelessly charged on a pad that can recharge multiple bricks at once.</p>
<p>When it detects NFC-equipped smart tags inside smart Lego tiles and minifigures, it will be able to interact with these sets and bring them to life. For example, the new Star Wars sets now support humming lightsabers, light-up blasters, and the roar of TIE Fighters and X-Wings.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6bfd6128cba40"><a title="LEGO Smart Brick" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6bfd6128cba40/lego-smart-brick.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: LEGO</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The source goes into more detail about this new smart brick (originally piloted in a Lego City set in 2024) and how it can enhance play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They have light and sound, light sensors, inertial sensors to detect movement, tilt, and gestures, and they form a Bluetooth mesh network with other Smart Bricks, so they’re aware of each other’s position and orientation — so Lego Star Wars ships and figures can do battle, for example, or so <em>The Imperial March</em> plays when you sit Emperor Palpatine on his throne. When built into Lego cars, the bricks could detect which one crosses a finish line first, or change from engine noises to crashing sound effects if the vehicle is flipped over."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lego Group spokesperson Jessica Benson also told the outlet how the new brick contains a microphone, which acts as a "virtual button" and sensor point for play functions - like blowing out candles on a cake (rather than recording anything). It has also been confirmed there is "no AI" or camera in this product, so don't expect the Lego Mario titles to be recognised.</p>
<p>As you might have already guessed, these smart bricks will bump up the costs of sets. Nintendo has also expanded its Lego line in recent years with IP such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>, so there's a chance future sets could utilise these new bricks.</p>

This is all "inspired by the updated content in the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game". You can see it in motion in the gameplay trailer above.</p>
