<figure data-uuid="7751340a518eb"><a title="A Link to the Past" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7751340a518eb/a-link-to-the-past.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Analytics firm <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/">Ampere Analysis</a> has posted a list of games it believes would greatly benefit from a remake or remaster (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ip-holders-are-sitting-on-a-wealth-of-content-analytics-firm-lists-18-games-ripe-for-remake-or-remaster-success/">VGC</a>). This is supposedly based on analysis of the market and consumer behaviours and attitudes – otherwise, we could just as easily pluck a bunch of games from thin air that we think need remakes!</p>
<p>What caught our eye straight away was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, both of which are, according to Ampere, prime candidates for full remakes. Now, we'd be happy to make a case for Chrono Trigger; especially if Square Enix wants to opt for the HD-2D style it's been evolving in recent years. A Link to the Past, though? Hmm, we're not sure about that.</p>
<p>The thing is with top-down Zelda games is that, in our opinion, they kind of need to <em>stay</em> top-down. And considering the game has already received a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>, we're not entirely convinced it really needs a remake.</p>
<p>Ampere writer Katie Holt says that while long-time fans consider it a high point in the series, “its dungeon and world design can be considered outdated, and the narrative is relatively linear by today’s standards”. In addition, searching for “The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past remake” on Reddit returns an astonishing 48,200 results, and Nintendo would supposedly be wise to approach it in a similar way to the Switch remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Ampere believes that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time_3d">Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> would benefit from a remake or a remaster – they're supposedly not fussed which. And yeah, we could get on board with this. With the 40th anniversary looming, we wouldn't be surprised to see Nintendo revisit what is arguably one of the most influential 3D adventure games of all time.</p>
<p>Here's the list of games from Ampere Analysis:</p>
<h3>Remake</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assassin’s Creed</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</li>
<li>Fallout</li>
<li>Rayman Origins</li>
<li>Resident Evil 5</li>
<li>Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune</li>
</ul>
<h3>Remaster</h3>
<ul>
<li>Batman: Arkham Origins</li>
<li>Bloodborne</li>
<li>Bully</li>
<li>Dragon Age Origins</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</li>
<li>Fallout: New Vegas</li>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Remake or Remaster</h3>
<ul>
<li>God of War (2005)</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</li>
<li>Far Cry</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</li>
</ul>

It's a pretty short one overall with few surprises, but one question regarding the Mario Kart franchise definitely piqued our interest.</p>
<p>Essentially, the query raises the possibility of another IP surpassing the sales of the Mario Kart franchise on Switch 2. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has already sold 9.57 million units on new console, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is comfortably the best-selling Switch game at an astonishing 69.56 million units.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_PuEn0ZOn5c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036rxnitv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Shigeru Miyamoto answered by stating that Nintendo has always worked with the belief that "there are no limits", citing the comparisons made between <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and other films released around the same time. If the film has reached number one, Nintendo believes it can always strive to do more.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that the if a new IP resonates with players, then it could absolutely go on to commercial success. But then he counters this by stating that Mario Kart would continue to sell regardless, and so "it may never be surpassed".</p>
<p>Amusingly, he then recalls a conversation with <strong>Pokémon</strong> creator Satoshi Tajiri. Speaking about the creation of Pokémon in Japan, Tajiri had supposedly joked with Miyamoto, stating “if you want to surpass Nintendo’s Mario, you’ll have to sell two copies of the software to each customer". This is apparently one of the driving forces behind the decision to create <strong>Pokémon Red and Green</strong>.</p>
<p>Surpassing Mario Kart will definitely be a tricky task for any publisher, including Nintendo itself. Not even the might of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> could knock Mario Kart 8 Deluxe off its throne.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how things pan out with the Switch 2 in the years to come.</p>
