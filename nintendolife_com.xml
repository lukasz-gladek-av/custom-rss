<p>Company is now offering replacements for all customers</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dbrand" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fc56ae4287071/dbrand.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Dbrand has admitted that its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">initial response to the Joy-Con detachment debacle</a> surrounding its new 'Killswitch' product was "spectacularly terrible".</p>
<p>If you're unaware, the Killswitch came under fire for supposedly causing the Switch 2's Joy-Con to detach from the console too easily when applied. Dbrand had attempted to defend this by laying out the conditions under which the detachment might occur, ultimately stating that "nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this".</p>
<p>Fans understandably took this to mean that Dbrand was shirking responsibility and shifting the blame to the users. It's not taken long for the company to catch wind of this, and so it has now issued an updated response on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dbrand-is-sending-improved-switch-2-grips-to-all-customers-after-spectacularly-terrible-response-to-detaching-claims/">VGC</a>) in which it finally takes full responsibility while offering replacements to all customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After reading through your feedback, it’s quite clear that our post was a spectacularly terrible response to the issue at hand. Some of you have expressed that opinion in a perfectly reasonable way. Others have expressed it with literal death threats."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dbrand goes on to say that while it still believes detachment would only occur under certain conditions, it ultimately agrees that this shouldn't necessarily matter, and that users should be able to hold the console and Killswitch in whatever manner they see fit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As easy as it is to boil our original post down to <em>“you’re holding it wrong,”</em> what we’re sober to now is the point that <em>you should be allowed to hold it however the f*** you want, without detachment occurring.</em> We get it. Please continue dunking on us for the next six to eight months for reincarnating Steve Jobs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company is currently looking at two potential solutions for the issue: the first is a complete redesign of the accessory that would theoretically completely resolve any potential detachment issues. Dband is not 100% certain that this option would be feasible to mass-produce at this time, but it is nevertheless giving it a shot.</p>
<p>The second is simply an improved version of the current product, which would still prove to be a lot more reliable than some of the products currently in users' hands. Whichever option Dbrand ultimately opts for will be communicated in a new update on <strong>10th July 2025</strong>. Regardless, everyone – whether you encountered the detachment issue or not – will be getting a replacement product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What we are 100% committed to is getting everyone replacement Joy-Cons ASAP, regardless of whether they’re severely affected, haven’t experienced the issue, have emailed us a dozen times, or have no clue about any of this."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<p>Whether we'll see this game get any significant content updates in the future is unclear at this stage, but at the moment, it seems Nintendo will at least be patching any issues discovered.</p>
<p>This follows an update for the <em>other</em> Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last week. Nintendo has also rolled out some Switch game updates today for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros.

<p>Nintendo has been branching out with movies, theme parks and last October it launched the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
<p>This venue features multiple historical exhibits, eight interactive experiences, a shop where you can purchase merchandise and much more. Now to add to this, the museum will be opening an art gallery.</p>
<p>The museum's official social media account has also confirmed this art gallery will be opening later this year on <strong>3rd September 2025</strong> on the second floor of the exhibition building.</p>
<p>At this location, visitors will be able to explore a "wide range of game artwork" including character illustrations and concept art. Visitors will also be able to change the date of their September ticket reservation.</p>
<p>This follows on from Nintendo Museum revealing a new exhibit for the Switch 2 back in April.</p>
