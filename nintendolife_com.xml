<figure><a title="gulikit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84b973a9e9ad8/gulikit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're not sure how or when including old tech in your brand new controllers became something to be boasting about, especially when it's Bluetooth technology that's been around since the early noughties, but that's where we're at with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2's</a> wake-up function currently.</p>
<p>Now, we all know by now that it's a bit of a pain that the original Switch Pro Controller, very surprisingly, doesn't support the ability to wake up Nintendo's new console, which is just daft, let's be brutally honest. Nobody wants to fork out the price of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro 2 Controller</a> just for this function (not in this economy!).</p>
<p>And so, Gulikit, the maestros of everything controller-related, have just dropped a new trailer for their new Switch 2 tech, with the emphasis firmly on the fact that <em>they</em> are the first third-party company to include the Switch 2 wake-up ability in their controllers.</p>
<p>You may know Gulikit already, they're pros when it comes to controller stick tech <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">like TMR and Hall Effect</a>, and they're also currently working on modules to help with potential stick drift on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/magnetic-joy-con-sticks-already-in-the-works-for-switch-2-amid-fears-of-drift">as we reported a little earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a video of one of the company's controllers waking up a Switch 2 below (hold on to your hats, it's a wild ride!), although we're sure it won't be long until the honour of being the only third-party brand with this unique function will be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Judging by the post on social media, the company will perhaps release a software patch for their entire range of Switch 2-compatible controllers to enable this function, we'll keep you posted on the ins and outs of that all as it becomes clearer. And it's interesting to note, too, that looking back through their social media, Gulikit have been working on this, even describing in another post how they've found that the new console uses a different protocol just days ago. Seems they had a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Let's hope it's not too long before this semi-essential function is once again included in all Switch 2 controllers!</p>

<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af87bff3bf78a/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7fExZx1QyU">Digital Foundry</a> has posted its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on the Switch 2, putting the game through its paces to see just how the main story and Phantom Liberty expansion hold up on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>To start, DF notes that the inclusion of Phantom Liberty itself is pretty remarkable given that developer CD Projekt Red opted to skip PS4 and Xbox One, favouring the beefier hardware seen in current-gen systems. The fact that the Switch 2 is able to handle this at all is commendable, but it should be said that this is where the hardware struggles the most.</p>
<p>As standard, Cyberpunk 2077 offers up four visual modes: 30fps quality and 40fps performance, with both also available as separate handheld options. Here's how each mode handles resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handheld Performance - 640x360 - 1280x720</li>
<li>Handheld Quality - 800x450 - 1440x810</li>
<li>Docked Performance - 960x540 - 1920x1080</li>
<li>Docked Quality - 1280x720 - 1920x1080</li>
</ul>
<p>DLSS is in use, but it's noted that high-paced action can cause a few visual hiccups, such as blurriness and temporal noise. However, outside of resolution, there's actually very little difference in visual quality between docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>When compared to other consoles, the Switch is running at the same texture quality setting as the PS5, putting it above Xbox Series X and PS4. Many in-game textures are purposefully the same across all platforms, but where there is a difference, the Switch 2 is actually one of the more accomplished consoles in this respect. Similarly, DLSS is put to great use, making image clarity a lot better on the Switch 2 when compared to the PS4.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the Switch 2 is a lot closer to the PS4 when it comes to pedestrian and vehicle density, so if the streets of Night City look a little quiet on the Switch 2, then you know why. It's largely done to ensure stable frame rates, but DF does still state that what the console is able to achieve is "impressive". With shadows, it's noted that indoor settings produce higher quality shadows than those seen on PS4, but outdoor shadows produced by the sun are actually slightly worse.</p>
<p>With frame rate, the Switch 2 holds up well, sticking to the 30fps target in quality mode for the main story. In the Phantom Liberty expansion, however, the more complex design of the environment causes frame rates on Switch 2 to drop as low as 20-25.</p>
<p>In the 40fps performance mode, the overall experience is a little bit of a mixed bag. Indoor areas are smoother, holding at around 40fps for the most part, but outdoor sections and busy shootouts actually cause the frame rate to drop down to 30fps or even slightly lower.</p>
<p>Finally, when playing handheld, it's estimated that frame rates are largely the same as docked, though DF isn't able to test this area properly. Thanks to VRR, however, it's said that portable play is probably the smoothest experience on Switch 2, though in instances where performance does drop below 30fps, it's a lot more noticeable.</p>

<p>For the dreamers!</p>

<figure><a title="switch 2 demo kiosks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c0f6cb2fc69d/switch-2-demo-kiosks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been absolutely flipping ages since this particular writer has had a go at a good old-fashioned demo kiosk for a Nintendo console (although many, many hours were spent on a SNES one in my local Woolworths back in the day), and so it's very exciting to see them out in the wild and being deployed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>. Nostalgia: it gets us every time.</p>
<p>Yes, we love a good demo kiosk, as you can maybe tell, and we're excited to see that gamers are beginning to spot Switch 2-flavoured kiosks being delivered and set up at various locations in the US, this time in a Target, for instance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9uqpc/nintendo_switch_2_demo_kiosks/">As seen over on Reddit</a>, the Nintendo-red setups enable anyone to get a shot on a bunch of titles. There's no half-measures here, you don't even have to get an angry staff member to switch the cart out when you want to try something else. Now that's progress.</p>

<p>As you can see from the selection of images above, it seems as though potential Switch 2 owners (or people like us who just can't walk past a chance to play something, even if we already own it) can select from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Nice!</p>
<p>The images also show a kiosk with both a Switch and Switch 2 demoed side by side, and everything seems reasonably peaceful. So, no sibling rivalry has set in just yet, then.</p>
<p>Demos on the kiosk in the pics apparently last 10 minutes, and a quick press of the Home button allows you to get back to selecting something else. We sort of want one of these now. Does anyone have Mario's phone number?</p>
