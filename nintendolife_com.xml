<p>We didn't start the fire</p>

<p>Those looking for something to relax and unwind to after a tough day of Knockout Tour might want to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/into_the_emberlands">Into The Emberlands</a>, a "cosy roguelike" from developer Tiny Roar (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xel">XEL</a>) and publisher Daedalic Entertainment that will be arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>2nd July</strong>.</p>
<p>This one launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856370/Into_the_Emberlands/">Steam</a> earlier this year and, to put it simply, it looks <em>super</em> cute. Into the Emberlands will see you play as a Lightbearer tasked with reuniting the titular world after it became swamped in a malicious miasma. To do so, you'll have to journey out into the fog with your Ember Lantern, collecting resources and rehoming the adorable little Knacks (the species you'll see in the above trailer) you'll encounter along the way.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You only have a limited number of steps per day — room for a little more <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a>, anyone? — and the gameplay loop will restart if you run out, with your previous Lightbearer setting up camp to be found on a future run.</p>
<p>It's combat-free, all about helping others, and colourful enough that we can imagine it being an all-round wholesome experience — and we could all do with a little of that every now and then.</p>
<p>You'll find a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Into-The-Emberlands-2848916.html">eShop listing</a>:</p>

<p>Don't expect first-party games</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Bitsummit 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/034614476e800/bitsummit-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bitsummit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that it will be attending BitSummit 2025 to showcase select indie games on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This year's event, dubbed <strong>BitSummit the 13th: Summer of Yokai</strong>, will take place at the the Miyako Messe in Kyoto City from <strong>Friday, 19th July to Sunday, 21st July</strong>. Tickets are on sale now for Japanese attendees via the <a href="https://t.pia.jp/en/pia/event/event.do?eventCd=2511585">Ticket Pia website</a>, while international attendees can use a dedicated <a href="https://ticket.pia.jp/piasp/inbound/bitsummit25eng.jsp">English-language page</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has stressed that it will not be showcasing any first-party games at the event, which is completely understandable given the nature of BitSummit. It's also confirmed that the Nintendo booth will be accessible via a lottery system, with the reservation page available at a later date.</p>
<p>Other confirmed publishers attending the event include PlayStation, PocketPair, Lost in Cult, Inti Creates, Spike Chunsoft, Devolver Digital, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo will no doubt be seeking every available opportunity to advertise the Switch 2 now that it's out in the wild. Having launched earlier this month, it's gone on to become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">fastest-selling console of all time in Japan</a>, and the fastest-selling Nintendo platform in both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>.</p>
