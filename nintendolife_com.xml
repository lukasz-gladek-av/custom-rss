<p>Horrifyingly good</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has revealed a bunch of new information for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> ahead of its Switch 2 launch next year on <strong>27th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live via the Switch 2 eShop, with a standard edition priced at £64.99 / $69.99 and a deluxe edition at £74.99 / $79.99. The latter will grant you the following bonus features, while pre-orders for either edition will bag a special Grace: Apocalypse costume:</p>
<p>- Five costumes include Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu<br>
- Two filters including Filter: Apocalypse<br>
- Four weapon skins including S&amp;S Weapon Skin: Apocalypse<br>
- Two charms including Charm: Mr. Raccoon<br>
- Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic<br>
- Files: Letters from 1998</p>

<p>That's not all, though. A limited edition Resident Evil Requiem Pro Controller has also been revealed for the Switch 2. Launching on the same day as the game itself, it'll come in a gunmetal colour scheme and boast key iconography.</p>
<p>Later in the year, during Summer 2026, a Grace Ashcroft amiibo will also release for the Switch 2. Functionality has not been confirmed, and nor do we get to see exactly what it looks like just yet, but this is very exciting news for fans of amiibo.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fd3c807d273d7"><a title="Deluxe - RE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd3c807d273d7/deluxe-re.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>A new Resident Evil Showcase will take place at the start of 2026 offering up a deeper look at Resident Evil Requiem before its launch, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, those who enjoy keeping fancy boxes on their shelves will want to check out the 'Generation Pack', a special edition release containing Requiem alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> on Switch 2. All three games launch on the same day.</p>

<p>So there you have it! Resident Evil fans are eating good, that's for sure. We're certain Capcom will have more surprises in store when the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary in the new year, so we'll be sure to keep you updated on any developments.</p>

<p>"The Wildest Adventure of Them All!" returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Limited Run Games has announced that it's bringing NES side-scrolling platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/little_samson">Little Samson</a> to the Switch in 2026. The reveal took place during the company's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK5Ow9zHA4U">10th anniversary stream</a>.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1992 for the NES and directed by former Capcom designer Shinichi Yoshimoto (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/strider">Strider</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ghouls_n_ghosts">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a>), Little Samson sees you controlling one of four characters — the eponymous Samson, a dragon called Kikira, the golem Gamm, or a mouse called K.O.</p>
<p>Each character controls a little differently and has different abilities — Kikira can breathe fire, for example, while Samson can climb walls and throw bells. Outside of the first four stages, which act like tutorials, you can swap which character you control at any point during the game. There are 20 stages to beat, with a true final boss that's only accessible if you beat the game on Normal difficulty.</p>

<p>In more recent years, Little Samson has become something of a collector's item. It's infamously one of the more-expensive NES games out there, with copies going for hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars online.</p>
<p>Well, now that won't be a problem, as Limited Run Games' Carbon Engine port will make it more accessible to all. Amazingly, we actually asked LRG's Josh Fairhurst about Little Samson when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/how-limited-runs-new-engine-respects-the-legacy-of-classic-games">we interviewed them way back in 2022</a>, and here's what he had to say then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s super high on games I want to do but no one knows where the rights are. We reached out to Taito and they said “They might be with the owner.” So we found the owner (who was really hard to find) and he said “I don’t know who has the rights.” So now we’re basically at a dead end. Who has the rights to Little Samson? No idea."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're glad the team made something work!</p>
<p>Though it's worth highlighting that Limited Run Games has come under fire in recent months due to delays on physical products, some items being below-standard, and NES cartridges that may damage your console. Josh also spoke to our sister site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-werve-certainly-made-mistakes-limited-runs-boss-on-winning-back-the-trust-of-the-community">Time Extension more recently about those issues</a>.</p>
