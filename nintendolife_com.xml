</section></header><div><section>

<p>One of the many announcements during last week's Nintendo's Partner showcase was the Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>With the game now available for the Switch 2 this week, Respawn Entertainment has outlined the game's performance details on this platform. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Enjoy up to 60 FPS, depending on monitor/hardware capability and compatibility (1920x1080 docked, 1792x1008 undocked)</p>
<p>- When you login, you’ll be redirected to the eShop to download Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch 2. You’ll be able to delete “Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch” after you login to the updated version.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you log into your Apex Legends account on the Switch or Switch 2 before 16th September 2025, you'll receive the "P.A.T.H." Pathfinder Skin!.</p>
<p>You can see the full patch notes for this latest update on EA's website. Once again, this game is a free download on the Switch 2. In terms of file size it requires <strong>31.7 GB</strong>.</p>

<p>And he'd love to make another soundtrack, "if asked"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="hip tanaka" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/156b6e5e3f525/hip-tanaka.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6S7C9Sh7xE&amp;ab_channel=ChipTanaka">Hip Tanaka</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Those lovely folks over at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/legendary-nintendo-composer-hip-tanaka-says-hed-love-to-make-another-full-game-soundtrack-if-asked/">VGC</a> spoke to the one and only Hirokazu Tanaka — better known as 'Hip' or 'Chip' Tanaka — at Bitsummit's Indie Game Event in Kyoto last month and, it seems, the main man may well be up for making some sweet new music, if somebody asks. Would somebody just let him make some new music quickly, please, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Tanaka, who you might know as the composer behind soundtracks for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/kid_icarus">Kid Icarus</a> and the Game Boy version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a>, to name just a few things he's got on the old CV. He worked on the soundtracks for both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a>. Oh, and he also played a key role in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poca-is-a-game-boy-camera-photobook-adventure-and-a-heartfelt-homage-to-hip-tanaka">creating and designing the Game Boy</a>. So, yeah, he's kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Mr Tanaka, who was in-house with Nintendo working on music all through the 8- and 16-bit eras, left the company and ended up as President of Creatures Inc after his work on the <strong>Pokémon</strong> anime became a conflict of interest for Nintendo.</p>
<p>And so it's delightful to hear, and doubly so given that Chip's work has shifted away from music somewhat since the move from Nintendo, that he's all in on returning to it. Speaking to VGC, when asked if he'd be into making another videogame soundtrack, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, if somebody came up to me and said ‘hey, do you want to make music for a game?’ I’d say ‘yeah, sure, sounds like fun...There’s a studio called 17-Bit making a game called <strong>Awaysis</strong>, created by a guy called Jake (Kazdal), and I actually made a track for that game. I’m not the only person making music for that game, there’s a bunch of us, but I created a track for it, and I’m playing it tomorrow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When then asked if he'd prefer to make single tracks or a full soundtrack, the musical maestro responded that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, to correct that [previous answer], I didn’t just do one song for Awaysis, I’m doing 70-80% of the game...But I think, for me, I spent my 20s to around 40 or so just making game music, and since then I’ve spent about 20 years where I haven’t really made any, so it’s kind of (about) getting back into it right now."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanaka also confirmed that he actually composed a track for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> saying, <em>“So if anybody comes up to me and says ‘hey, can you do this’, I’d be like ‘yes, I’d love to’.</em> Now, let's check out Mr Tanaka's contribution to Street Fighter 6, 'Glorious Match'!</p>

<p><em>So, who's gonna give the man a job writing a new soundtrack? Let us know your thoughts!</em></p></section>
