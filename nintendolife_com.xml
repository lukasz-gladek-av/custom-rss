<figure data-uuid="44c983db61caa"><a title="Goodnight Universe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44c983db61caa/goodnight-universe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Skybound Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>We really liked <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a>, Nice Dream's follow-up to GoodbyeWorld's award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/before_your_eyes">Before Your Eyes</a>. But for the Switch 2 version, there was one big thing absent that players on Steam had — camera support. Eye-tracking and facial recognition is a big part of the game, but with the feature missing at launch on the hybrid console, we just had to be patient.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for those of you who have been holding off or who have been dying to replay the game as-intended, camera support is finally here! So, as long as you have the Switch 2 version of the game and a compatible USB camera (or the official one), then you're game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8jqphwx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Accompanied by a cute little visual to show you the best way to set up the camera for optimal eye-tracking magic, today's update also includes a little visual fidelity boost for the newest console.</p>
<p>As for setting the camera up, publisher Skybound Games recommends you play using this method in a well-lite space, with the camera positioned around 18-24 inches in front of you, with your face fully visible. You'll be able to test this all in-game before you start.</p>

<p>Well, time for us to dust the ol' Switch 2 camera off then. If you happened to miss Goodnight Universe last year, then prepare yourself for a beautiful narrative adventure.</p>
<p>The game has you control a six-month-old named Isaac — that's the age where you don't really understand <em>anything</em> and you're trying to get to grips with limbs, movement, all sorts of weird things! Oh, Isaac is <em>also</em> developing psychic powers, and a tech corporation has found out about that. So that's just an extra thing on top of everything else. Fun!</p>
<p>We scored the original release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">a 7/10 back in November 2025</a>, but even without the camera implementation, we thought the game was solid: "Isaac’s supernatural adventures are as entertaining as they are heartwarming, and though it isn't terribly long, it makes full use of every moment."</p>

The nine winners will then go head-to-head in a final poll at the end of the month.</p>
<p>We're covering a generation a day until we've ticked off all nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days</strong>.</p>
<p>It's Day Five, and Gen V (or 5 if the Roman numerals are a bit fancy-pants for your tastes) is up, meaning 'mon from Unova and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl">Pokémon Black &amp; White</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white_2">Black &amp; White 2</a>.

<p>Let's crack on. We've got a chunky 156 new Pokémon this generation, listed in National Dex order (use the search bar to quickly find a specific Pokémon). As always, <strong>you can only choose one!</strong></p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Keep an eye out for further generations in the coming days as we cruise towards Pokémon's 30th anniversary.</em></p>
<p><em>And if you missed Gens 1, 2, 3, or 4, those polls are still live:<br></em></p>
