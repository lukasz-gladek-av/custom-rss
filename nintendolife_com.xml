<p>If you thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> was slowing down anytime soon, think again. Sega has <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/2008222145701368299">announced</a> that the Pac-Man Pack will be available on <strong>7th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Alongside the upcoming DLC, which includes the iconic Namco character as a playable racer, PAC-MAN Festival is also kicking off a day later on <strong>8th January from 4pm PT / 7pm ET / 9th January 12am GMT</strong> until <strong>11th January at</strong> <strong>3:59 pm. PT / 6:59 p.m. ET / 11:59pm GMT</strong>. Note that you don't need to buy the Pac-Man pack to take part in the festival.</p>
<p>Pac-Man's arrival is the third in the Season Pass line-up, with Mega Man set to join the race later in the year along with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>
