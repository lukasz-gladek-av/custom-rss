<p>Along with this, a new teaser trailer has also been released(<a href="https://youtu.be/h4rN8VwxAmM">via the IGN Gamescom Showcase</a>), with developer Playtonic Games announcing its "next major update" about Yooka-Replaylee will be taking place during The MIX Fall Showcase on <strong>29th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>In an update earlier this month, PM Studios mentioned how Yooka-Replayee was now "content complete", with a release date announcement coming "soon".</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7cada14c96d8/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Six years. Much has been said in the last six years about Team Cherry's near radio silence on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Promises from Microsoft about the game coming out "in the next 12 months" in 2022. No playable demo since E3 2019. No Kickstarter updates. And a furore of hungry fans whipping themselves into a frenzy and building an entire community on memes and anguish.</p>
<p>Then, on 19th August, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/teamcherry.bsky.social/post/3lwr4yoxbis2b">we found out that was about to change</a>: "The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!" Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4vytd322k">revealed he'd spoken to the devs</a> last month and promised to share "the story behind why Silksong took seven years to make...". Even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/geoff-keighley-either-knows-something-about-silksong-or-is-just-being-a-tool">Geoff Keighley got in on the action</a> and, during Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live, shared a brief snippet of (blurry) gameplay. The hype was reaching fever pitch.</p>
<p>And, as promised, at 3:30pm BST on Thursday 21st August, the news dropped. Silksong is finally coming out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">on 4th September 2025</a>. Team Cherry's co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">story was out there</a>. Was there drama? Fireworks?</p>
<p>Nope. It was all beautifully anticlimactic in the best possible way; a sub-two minute trailer that showed us this was "more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>". No over-explaining mechanics or details. Some glimpses of boss fights, towns, characters, and movement. And, of course, that release date.</p>
<p>In fact, you can go even further — the Silksong release trailer is structured almost identically to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4&amp;ab_channel=TeamCherry">the Hollow Knight equivalent</a>, right down to the language. "Face over 140 ferocious foes" and "Descend into a vast, ruined world" in Hollow Knight is now "Battle over 200 ferocious foes" and "Ascend to the peak of a haunted kingdom" in Silksong. It's not subtle, but I'll say it again: <em>Silksong is more Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

<p>Watching that Silksong trailer was like seeing an old friend after a long period of time; an event that you build up in your head, only for it to be a completely normal moment. Last month, I visited the UK for the first time in two years, and I arranged to meet up with a friend; I worried, I overthought things, I thought about what to wear. Then when we did meet, we hugged, asked each other how we were, and chatted like we'd never been apart. Completely ordinary, just like this trailer drop.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of a better way for Silksong to reintroduce itself to the world, on Team Cherry's own terms. For years, after every Nintendo Direct, every Indie World, every Summer Game Fest, people decried that it was over, clown paint and hair at the ready, frustration boiling over. There had to be <em>something</em> going on, right?</p>
<p>Yet, there wasn't — at least, that's what Gibson and Pellen told Schreier. Team Cherry isn't here to provide the audience with juicy gossip or to fuel the fandom with even more fire. "Why did it take so long?" Schreier says in the piece. The response? They were having fun, blissfully ignorant (mostly) of the whirlwind of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1ixqje9/genuine_question_how_do_you_define_silkpost/">'Silkposting'</a> online: "This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It’s nice to make fun things."</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdfc2faf10c74/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fun thing can also be scary thing...? — <em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether that's true or not is another story, but it's refreshing to hear that the team (Gibson, Pellen, Jack Vine, and composer Christopher Larkin) took the time to do whatever they wanted, and they had the money to do it. Look, I am the first person to admit that I'm excited to play Silksong, and I acknowledge that video games media and coverage (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-do-you-think-well-see-hollow-knight-silksong-this-year">including us</a>!) has, in part, contributed to the bubbling pot of Silksong fever. But I've also never really got the voracious need to have this game in people's hands.</p>
<p>Team Cherry was never going to release Silksong if it wasn't ready — the devs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/team_cherry_shares_more_hollow_knight_silksong_details_will_launch_when_its_ready">said this back in 2019</a>. We read so many stories about crunch, pressure from higher-ups, and games failing to hit unrealistic deadlines and targets. Creators should be allowed to flourish and make whatever the heck they want, no matter how long it takes, and we shouldn't grief them for it.</p>
<p>Could the team have said something? Maybe, but as Gibson argues, “We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it.’" Hollow Knight was a different beast, a studio's very first game, and so there was almost an obligation to keep people in the loop. Silksong became so much more than it was ever meant to be.</p>

<p>A lot has changed in the six years since Silksong's last playable demo, but Silksong and Team Cherry remain defiant; their timeline is their own. That playable demo at Gamescom 2025? Apparently it was almost identical to the E3 2019 (RIP) one. Silksong is likely an iteration of Hollow Knight — and we've seen some of the best sequels ever made with iterative installments like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and even smaller games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/freedom_planet_2">Freedom Planet 2</a>, another indie that went through a long-development cycle.</p>
<p>The Metroidvania (or action-platformer, or search-action, whatever you want to call it) was already blooming prior to Hollow Knight's release, but now it's truly exploded. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nine_sols">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/prince_of_persia_the_lost_crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/timespinner">Timespinner</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_custodian">Crypt Custodian</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Magnolia</a> — these are just a few of my favourites I've played that launched between Hollow Knight and Silksong. And while Hollow Knight might sit at the top of that pantheon for me, even surpassing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Symphony of the Night</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, Silksong should be treated as just another game release. Detach it from the hype machine and just enjoy it for what it is.</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1d60621284619/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Hornet, prepare yourself...! — <em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of focusing on whether Silksong will live up to the hype (I don't even know if that's possible), or already proclaiming that it's "GOTY 2025" (it's not even <em>out</em> yet — and hey, maybe I'll end up saying that in December), we should celebrate that Team Cherry made a game on their own terms, in their own time. That should be the norm in this industry, and it's a darn shame it isn't.</p>

<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158190/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The last time I tried shepherding an unruly beast, I wasn’t exactly a fan. It was midnight, I was exhausted, and my dog simply refused to come back inside. Typical. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/herdling">Herdling</a> offers a much cosier alternative, replacing a stubborn pup with fantastical beasties that <em>actually</em> listen to me.</p>
<p>Developed by Okomotive, the studio behind the wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/far_changing_tides">FAR</a> series, Herdling carries the same blend of quiet melancholy and atmosphere as the studio’s other games. Though fleeting in length, Herdling is a breath of fresh air - a journey sure to stick with you, even if its core gameplay feels a tad clunky.</p>
<p>The game begins beneath a quiet city overpass at dawn, as your silent protagonist shakes off a rough night in their makeshift shelter. Leaves swirl in the wind as car alarms echo and flickering streetlights guide you toward a meet-cute with your first calicorn - a lovable, smooth-brained lump of horn and fur, like an oversized ram. As the sun rises over distant mountains, your new life as a shepherd begins. Armed with nothing more than a leafy stick and some seriously impressive cardiovascular fitness, your goal is clear: guide a growing herd of beasts toward a better life. Oh, and yes, of course you can pet the calicorns.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158192/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The plot takes a comfortable backseat. Without a single line of dialogue, Herdling clearly wants you to <em>feel</em> its story - a choice I appreciate. Games like <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/journey">Journey</a> have perfected this approach, telling deeply emotional stories through world and atmosphere, and Herdling follows suit.</p>
<p>The lack of dialogue allows for composer Joel Schoch’s wondrous melodies to do all the talking. Out the gate, Herdling’s soundtrack solidified itself as the primary plucker of my heart strings. An ensemble of cheeky flourishes, soothing ambience, and powerful compositions match the tone and pace of each storybeat. Crashing percussion and soaring woodwinds turn a rush through open fields into something truly epic; gentle keys, on the other hand, speak to the fear of a lonely calicorn. It’s all beautiful.</p>
<p>Your journey is broken into cosy chapters where you clean, feed, and decorate your herd, leading them through foggy forests, abandoned trainyards, and treacherous mountain passes. Call of the wild stuff, really. Along the way, you’ll stop at campsites where you tend to a warm fire, curl up with your herd to rest, and ponder the shepherd’s cryptic dreams. It’s clear Okomotive wants you to bond with your beasts, asking you to name each calicorn you rescue which builds a bond between you (the player) and your herd. And y’know, nothing stings quite like watching the newly christened “Jim” stumble off a cliff. Poor, lemming-like Jim.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158191/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay is fairly straightforward, relying on light environmental puzzles and manageable challenges. It’s mostly an easy ride: the odd spike trap, a tricky crevice or two but it’s otherwise a steady trot to the top for your fluffy convoy. Early on, I chuckled when the herding control scheme was disguised as a driver’s ed course: cones, cars, and cardboard boxes - a cute way to introduce Herdling’s quirky control scheme.</p>
<p>The game does throw in a few environmental variations to spice things up - bushes that slow you down, slippery slopes, and gusty winds. On the flip side, clusters of colourful flowers boost your herd’s abilities. Blue blooms refill the stampede meter, yellow ones pop up for the odd environmental puzzle, and red… Well, I’ll be honest, I never really figured out their purpose beyond looking cool when you plough through them. I’ll admit, as much as I’m a fan of these silent, music-driven games, I would’ve liked an odd huff or grunt each time I burned through a stampede boost.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158199/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, controlling your herd is intuitive in theory, but in practice? Less so. To guide your pack forward, you stand behind them and hold ZR, nudging left or right like a sheepdog flanking its herd: step to their left, they swing right; step to their right, they swing left. In addition you can tap buttons to slow, stop, and even stampede. However, when a single calicorn is twice your size and moves like a forklift, keeping track of your cursor – or predicting the chaos – becomes a challenge. No surprise then that my fluffy wrecking ball bulldozed that driver’s ed setup first go.</p>
<p>While I eventually felt like a herd lord, the janky herding mechanics began to wear thin fairly quickly. Early puzzles are basic and hazards never evolve much. Occasionally, you’ll break off from the herd to pull a lever, open a gate, or hop across a chasm or two, but that’s about as deep as it goes.</p>
<p>Despite the calicorns’ big, red <em>harrowing</em> eyes, they don’t feel especially <em>alive</em>. They’re tagged with personality types such as brave, affectionate, even ‘rascal’, but these don’t seem to impact how they behave. They mostly just fall in line. Shame, really, because as your herd grows and the game introduces its horrid, gangly bird-like baddies, you get a real sense of what Okomotive is aiming for.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158194/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At one point, I even purposely guided one of my troops (of course, it was Jim again) into a spike trap. For science, of course. Sure enough, they took damage, which obviously made me feel bad (I’m not a <em>monster</em>), but a quick snack from some nearby shrubbery patched up the unlucky test subject. Still, it’s clear challenge isn’t the point here. Like the FAR games, Herdling is about the mood - the phenomenal soundtrack, the thoughtful world, and the lovable cast of furry characters.</p>
<p>That said, performance on the Switch 1 is disappointing. It’s playable, sure, but frame rate drops and muddy textures really detract from the experience - especially in a game that thrives on immersion. There’s also a camera bug near the start of the game which can be frustrating. Fortunately, the Switch 2 handles Herdling better with a smoother framerate, but textures and lighting still look a bit flat.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Herdling is a cosy, heartfelt trek that feels like a breath of fresh air and its stunning atmosphere and soundtrack do much of the heavy lifting. Whilst the game rarely stumbles, it seldom soars and often gets stuck behind janky controls or disappointing performance. Still, for all its rough edges, Herdling is a memorable adventure. If you’re chasing the next grand expedition, this game might fall short, but if it’s vibes you seek, look no further than this herd of lovable, clumsy beasts.</p></section>

<figure><a title="OFF" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/108bafb36749a/off.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Fangamer</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, it's the weekend once again, which means it's time to get some gaming done!</p>
<p>But first, a recap. This week, Capcom launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/capcom-launches-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-website">an intriguing 30th anniversary website for Resident Evil</a>, though there's not much on there right now beyond some cool artwork. Gamescom also happened, which means we got some really cool announcements including a port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> in 2026, and brand-new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/atari-announces-bubsy-4d-from-demon-turf-developer-fabraz">Bubsy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/he-man-is-the-next-80s-icon-getting-his-own-stunning-arcade-style-retro-revival">He-Man</a> games! What!</p>
<p>Nintendo also showcased a new Direct looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which officially launches on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. We even got to go hands-on with the game at Gamescom, and it's looking really nice, y'all.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">release date</a>. No big deal.</p>
<p>Now, let's see what we're all up this weekend, hmm..?</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment. I ended up buying the Year 3 Character Pass, so I'm currently getting to grips with Sagat (ooh, matron) and I can't wait for the other characters to launch.</p>
<p>I'm also quite keen to jump back into the GameCube app and play a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, but we'll see how much free time I manage to carve out.</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>It's no good, I just can't stop playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on my Nintendo Switch 2. Every time I think I've done the vast majority of quests, I'm made aware by an off-hand comment vaguely referencing a mission I have absolutely zero memory of, so I'm compelled to do my duty (I know) and tick an item off my list that I didn't even know was there.</p>
<p>This time around it's a little quest called 'Don't Fear the Reaper'. Anyone familiar with this should know that this could take me some time...</p>

<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/off">OFF</a> may not be a long game by any means, but having just rolled credits on it the other day means my slate is pretty clean now! Of course, I’m slowly chipping away at the battle pass in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> as I <em>HAVE</em> to have those Green and White Ranger skins! Whenever a game lets me play as Tommy, you know I’m in.</p>
<p>I’m also playing though <strong>REDACTED</strong> and am having a pretty swell time with it! I’d say more…but…embargoes, amirite? I’ll spew about it soon, promise.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Ever one to have my finger on the pulse of what’s hip and trendy, I have started playing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> on my PS5 after getting dewy-eyed reminiscing about my time with it on PS2. It’s still a damn good game, I’ve got to give it that, and I’d love to get it wrapped up this weekend so I’m all clear for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> takeoff in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Let’s stay with the contemporary theme and throw in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, too. I never played this one back in the day, so it’ll be nice to see what it’s all about!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After dabbling around with Chibi-Robo for some screenshots this week, I think I'm actually going to play the whole darned thing, something I've never done before. It's weird and delightful and actually a little bit uncomfortable, which I love so far. So I'm excited to dive in further.</p>
<p>That's really all I have planned. Very uneventful, right? Have a good one, all!</p>
