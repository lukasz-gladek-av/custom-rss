<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> got some of the spotlight in the latest broadcast, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-kirby-amiibo-will-apparently-be-nintendos-most-expensive-amiibo-ever">and apart from those new amiibo</a>, it's also been revealed there will be <em>another</em> 'Direct' taking place in the future.</p>
<p>This "2nd presentation" will once again be hosted by the game's director Masahiro Sakurai. We don't know what specifically will be revealed in this next show just yet or when exactly it will be aired but it's "on the way". During this week's Nintendo Direct, it was mentioned how "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" would be shared in the future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Sakurai also acknowledged this announcement via social media (here's a rough translation via DeepL):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was introduced to [a] Direct within [a] Direct... I'll do it! It's not something I can make right away, but please be patient"</p>

<p>When we find out more about this upcoming Direct, we'll be sure to let you know. In the meantime, you can check out the previous Kirby Air Riders broadcast, which revealed the playable roster of racers, courses, items and power ups, multiplayer aspects and much more.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, there'll be a few (paid) gates you'll need to pass through before you can even access this particular library. Not only will you need to have an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription (aka the premium-priced tier), but you'll also be "required" to fork out for an accessory.</p>
<p>Apart from this information during the broadcast, Nintendo has also made note of this requirement on its official website:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ostzqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch and Virtual Boy (Cardboard Model) for Nintendo Switch 2/Nintendo Switch are required to play the Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership required to access Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics collection of games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two headset options to choose from. If you don't want to pay <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) for the replica, there is the cheaper cardboard model, which will set you back <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>. Nintendo's website also notes how users will need to have a paid Switch Online membership to purchase these accessories.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there's been a mixed reaction online to this, with some Nintendo diehards welcoming the Virtual Boy's return with open arms, while others are venting frustration about the price, the requirements to access it, and how there's still no option to officially experience these games without a headset.</p>
<p>Once again, this library will launch on 17th February 2026, with both accessories due out on the same date. You can see the games on the way to this particular digital library in our previous story:</p>

<p>Apart from the cost of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> pack, one other talking point following the latest Direct is the pricing of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> amiibo.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/kirby-air-riders-amiibo-price/">highlighted by Nintendo Everything</a>, these new figures will reportedly be Nintendo's "most expensive amiibo ever". To reiterate, it means fans will apparently have to fork out more than they've ever previously had to for first-party amiibo. One difference compared to your regular amiibo is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">swappable base</a>.</p>
<p>A single Kirby Air Riders figure will set you back $50 USD, or if you want to pick up both the Kirby and Waddle Dee figures, you'll be looking at a total cost of $100! Retailer listings with these same prices attached have already gone live in the US, and we'll be on the lookout for prices in other regions as they pop up.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo also noted during the Direct how it would have "more Kirby Air Riders amiibo updates" to share in the future.</p>
<p>The same broadcast this week confirmed new amiibo for the Super Mario Galaxy bundle as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>. Fortunately, the amiibo for these games are slightly <em>less</em> expensive. Samus and her new bike is priced at $40, while standalone versions of Samus and Slyux are $30 each. As for the Galaxy amiibo (Mario &amp; Rosalina), they'll be $40 each.</p>

<p>In case you missed it during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> announcement, Rosalina's Storybook will be getting a physical release.</p>
<p>This product is based on the same storybook featured in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and will be available via the My Nintendo Store website. The US store has now confirmed it will be priced at $24.99 (or your regional equivalent) and arrives later this year on 25th November 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo has teamed up with Dark Horse Books to release this "beautiful hardcover volume". It's worth noting that the new pages featured in the upcoming releases <em>won't</em> be included in the physical print. Here's the official fine print about this from the latest Direct broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rosalina's Storybook does not include newly added pages from the Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's the official description, along with another look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our story begins a very, very long time ago with a young girl who spotted a rusted spaceship holding a small star child, Luma.</p>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.</p>
<p>Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present Rosalina’s Storybook —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>

<p>Yes, just months after the game's initial release on the Switch 2, DK's latest outing has now been bolstered with some smashing new content, and it's available right now. As part of the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a>, Nintendo has also bumped the base game up to Version 2.0.0.</p>
<p>We've got the full patch notes here, which go into a little more detail about the changes. This is the second update for the title, which also makes "several other changes" to improve the overall gameplay experience. Here's the rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 2.0.0 (Released September 12, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the paid DLC DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush.
<ul>
<li>If you have not cleared the main game yet, you can go to DK Island by talking to Squawks at the Racing Layer.</li>
<li>If you have cleared the main game, you can go to DK Island by striking the Warp Gong after hearing about the “Bananza Rehearsal” from the Elder.</li>
<li>After reaching DK Island, you can play Emerald Rush by talking to Void Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of Banandium Chips that can be stored has been increased from 9,999 to 99,999.</li>
<li>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned, even if you haven't cleared the "main game" just yet, you can still go to this island by interacting with Squawks on the Racing Layer. Of course, it's paid content, so you'll need to fork out $19.99 / £16.99 (or your regional equivalent) before you can access it.</p>
<p>And if you are still unsure about this game, there's now a Switch 2 demo you can download from the Nintendo eShop.</p>

<p>It's been a busy day thanks to Nintendo's huge hour-long Direct, but the Japanese broadcast still managed to have a surprise in store for us — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Coming to Switch in 2026, Capcom announced the collection via the Japanese showcase, but also dropped an English trailer, confirming we'd be seeing the remastered set in the West in 2026. The game will also be at this year's Tokyo Game Show.<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force"><br></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force">Mega Man Star Force</a> is a subseries of RPGs that launched on the DS between 2007 and 2009, to coincide with the Blue Bomber's 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>And, in this collection, all three games are included — Mega Man Star Force, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force_2">Mega Man Star Force 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force_3">Mega Man Star Force 3</a>, along with their respective additional versions. So, let's break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Leo</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxNinja</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxSamurai</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</li>
</ul>
<p>These games continue to evolve the gameplay from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_battle_network_legacy_collection">Mega Man Battle Network</a>, though back in the day, many critics thought the newer titles didn't go far enough.</p>
<p>You can check out more details on the <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/megaman/starforce/en-us/">collection's official website</a>, but colour us surprised by the announcement!</p>
