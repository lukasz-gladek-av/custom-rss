<p>With a particularly spooky reveal</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has revealed yet another new Mega Evolution that will make its debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and it's Victreebel being put in the limelight this time.</p>
<p>This classic Grass / Poison Type has been a series mainstay throughout the generations, and its new Mega design looks particularly... sweet (<em>heh</em>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Mega-Evolution-of-the-Flycatcher-Pokemon-VictreebelMega-VictreebelAppe">The Pokémon Company</a>, Mega Victreel stands at 14'9" (4.5 m) and weighs in at 276.7 lbs. (125.5 kg). Yep, he <em>big</em>. The official description reads, "The volume of this Pokémon’s acid has increased due to Mega Evolution, filling its mouth. If it’s not careful, the acid will overflow and spill out". <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at Mega Victreel in-game. Relish in its goofy-smile glory:</p>

<p>The Mega was revealed in a particularly spooky little clip on TPC's official YouTube channel, titled 'The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident'. It shows two trainers making their way through a creepy house, following a trail of mysterious, sweet-smelling purple goo.</p>
<p>It might have given us our first look at Victreebell's new Mega form (not our first pick, but a nice addition), but our biggest takeaway is just how much a Pokémon horror game would <em>slap</em>.</p>
<p>If the above reveal was a little too spooky for your tastes, TPC also released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79j5pSboEQ">in-game trailer</a>, which shows Mega Victreel hunting down 'mon in the wild. We'll be keeping an eye out for similar reveals in the coming months before Pokémon Legends: Z-A arrives on Switch 1 and 2 on 16th October.</p>
