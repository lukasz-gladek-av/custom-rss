<figure><a title="Switch 2 / PS5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a208dca657808/switch-2-ps5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been out for a little over a week now, and it's already breaking records in multiple regions. Nintendo has confirmed that the console <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold 3.5 million units in the first four days of sale</a>, but it's also become the fastest-selling Nintendo console in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>, and Japan. In the latter region specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">Switch 2 also beat the PlayStation 2</a> to become the fast-selling console <em>of all time</em>. Crikey.</p>
<p>Naturally, thoughts are inevitably turning toward Nintendo's direct competition, and whether the likes of Sony and Microsoft might be concerned about the Switch 2's monumental success. Well, <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html">according to SIE's new president and CEO, Hideaki Nishino</a> during a Business Segment fireside chat, the company isn't particularly bothered (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-sony-says-ps5-performance-required-for-great-experience-on-a-big-screen/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>When asked if the Switch 2's improved specs and Nintendo's relationships with third-party publishers caused any concern, Nishino was keen to reiterate the appeal of the PS5 against its competitors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We closely monitor the overall gaming industry, including the actions of other market participants. Additionally, catalysts in the market are great for the industry as a whole, as they invigorate the excitement and demand more broadly. So it’s great to have people launching new things.</p>
<p>“However, as I mentioned previously, we have a differentiated strategy. PlayStation 5 is designed for an immersive gaming experience, and this includes the innovative DualSense controller features as well. We believe PS5-level performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering for players and creators in this current console generation.</p>
<p>“However, publisher strategies are increasingly shifting towards being multi-platform, so more platforms can run the same game, which is great from a creator’s perspective. Among those platforms, our mission is that we will continue to be the best place to play and publish.</p>
<p>“As such, we have empowered our creators to leverage our offering and services to create amazing, unique experiences for players with high engagement and great monetisation opportunities. We have done this consistently as the industry and competitive dynamics have evolved. And of course, PlayStation Studios, our franchises, have a special role in showcasing the PlayStation experience and then strengthening the player’s vision with us.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Sony, the PS5 is a great system, though we'd be lying if we said that its first-party offering was thriving at the moment. Sony has struggled recently with its ill-conceived focus on live-service games, resulting in the highly-publicised failure of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/concord">Concord</a>, the cancellation of <strong>The Last of Us Online</strong>, and ongoing concerns around Bungie's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>That said, PS5 will have pretty tempting exclusives this year in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/saros">Saros</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> following later.</p>
<p>There's room for all, is what we're saying. But it's going to be interesting to see how the dynamic between the Big Three changes with the Switch 2. Chances are there are a few publishers who regret not supporting the Switch enough in recent years, so we suspect that will no doubt change going forward.</p>

<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cd4707bfde1a1/street-fighter-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> launched for the Switch 2 last week and if you've been wanting to throw your support behind this particular version of the game, but aren't confident it will be supported on the same level as other platforms, we've got some good news.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jun/12/street-fighter-switch-2-tournament/">highlighted by EventHubs</a>, the Nintendo version has been declared tournament legal, which means the Switch 2 version is now officially acceptable for online and offline tournaments according to <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/cpt/rules/">Capcom's Pro Tour website</a>. This update originally came into effect on 9th June, just days after the release of the game on Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>While it might seem like this was always going to be the case, during past generations, certain third-party fighting games have isolated Nintendo builds – resulting in major updates and DLC at a later date. As the source notes, the Switch 2 version supports cross-play functionality (including Capcom's ID account system), which is a point of difference in this case, so it's "hardly a surprise".</p>
<p>Still, it's a nice contrast to some other fighting games on Nintendo platforms. For example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> (which landed on the Switch earlier this year) is still yet to receive the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/guilty-gear-strive-adds-another-dlc-character-to-its-season-pass-4-roster">latest seasonal DLC fighters</a>. So, it's once again great news to see the Switch 2 version of Street Fighter 6 being treated equally.</p>
<p>You can find out our thoughts about this version of Street Fighter 6 in our full review here on Nintendo Life. In some related news, Capcom this week announced the lifetime sales of the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">have now surpassed the five million mark</a>.</p>

In this particular case, we're actually referring to Piggyback's upcoming art book '<strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>'.</p>
<p>This book, developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, was originally scheduled to launch in Summer 2025 and then <a href="https://x.com/PiggybackGuides/status/1894447510669705488">narrowed down the date to 24th June 2025</a>, but has now been pushed back to <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. <a href="https://www.piggyback.com/us/guide/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective/">Pre-orders have also gone live</a> since our last update.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>When this art book eventually releases, Metroid fans can look forward to a 212-page visual retrospective that goes behind the scenes on the series' development including a foreword by Metroid Prime producer Kensuke Tanabe.</p>
<p>This book will retail for <strong>£39.99 / €44.99</strong> and you can find out more about it in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, it's currently set to arrive at some point in 2025, with Nintendo also recently revealing a Switch 2 version which will enhance the experience and also add some additional features like mouse control.</p>

<p>Breaking records in less than a week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a6181ef1adbe/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo shared its first official sales data for the Switch 2 – confirming the new hybrid system had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide"</a> in just the first four days, making it the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware within this amount of time.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the video game firm has revealed this new device is also the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware in the US" in four days. This was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">reported by IGN</a> – with the outlet also told "Switch 2 sales in all regions were approximately twice those of the Nintendo Switch 1 across both consoles' first four days on the market". Nintendo has not provided specific sales figures for this region.</p>
<p>This follows reports about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">system's positive start in locations like the UK</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">and Japan</a>. Unsurprisingly, the launch is also benefiting certain franchises such as Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which has now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">surpassed five million lifetime sales</a> just a week later.</p>
<p>It's still early days for the Switch 2, and there were obviously some concerns about pricing and supply in the lead-up, but based on the official sales updates so far, it appears to be an excellent start. Nintendo will bolster the new device's software library next month with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and it's likely to welcome even more consumers to the Switch 2 family with games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> later this year.</p>
