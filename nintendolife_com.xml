<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is just days out from launch, and in case you missed it, you can redeem the eShop version of this title with a Nintendo Switch Game Voucher. You could also grab this version with a voucher and then pay to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p>
<p>This follows the news in July that Nintendo would be discontinuing Switch Online Vouchers. Although these vouchers will no longer be sold after <strong>30th January 2026</strong>, Nintendo has said it will continue to add Switch titles to the voucher catalogue throughout the same year. Vouchers will remain valid for 12 months from the purchase date.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>One of the other titles to recently join the Switch voucher program was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which you can also pay to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Nintendo hasn't announced if it will release a similar voucher program for the Switch 2 (<em>at least for now</em>), but if we hear anything, we'll let you know.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194232,194327 @ 1764414038 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This is my final weekend before <em>all the games</em> release, so I'm determined to wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> and get a run or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> under my belt. Yes, these are the same two games that I have been playing every weekend for weeks now, and no, I will not apologise for that.</p>
<p>I'm already nervously eyeing all the titles I'll want to pick up in the next seven days, so I'll be trying to enjoy having some money while I can. That said, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/switch-2-black-friday-deals-are-a-bit-meh-but-here-are-the-best-weve-seen">Black Friday deal</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that's looking <em>particularly</em> tempting...</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a> a shot this weekend if I get chance – it looks so cool! Other than that, a quick dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> before the fourth entry drops sounds like it might be on the cards. Have a good weekend, folks!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>I forgot to mention that last weekend I went to the 10th edition of Lisboa Games Week. As one of the leading video game culture shows in Portugal, it is always a great place to meet old friends, make new ones and play the latest upcoming chart toppers. Nintendo had the biggest show floor ever, right at the main entrance, so it was impossible to miss all that Switch 2 red-tinted area. I was surprised to have play time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, both running their demo builds quite smoothly. The main reason that made me not stay at home was hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>… and I was smiling the whole way. The latest entry in the series came out in 2007, I was an entirely different person back then. With the imminent release, I am clearing my schedule to ensure that it is all Samus Aran from next week onwards (and yes, my head is still back there, I got me a bad case of post-convention blues!).</p>
<p>My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. Will I be able to complete it before next week? Certainly not. Will I be redecorating the streets of Kamurochō with every street thug foolish enough to look me sideways until then? Put your money on the Dragon of Dojima, and you will never be poor again.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>Not much time for gaming this weekend, as the HOLIDAY TIME has begun. I've got a Christmas party, a Christmas craft market, a house Christmas decoration plan, and a (not-Christmas) D&amp;D session.</p>
<p>But I did just buy <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a> in the Steam Sale, like I said I would last week. So mayyyyyybe I can find the time in between all the Christmas...</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing and loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> update has got me surveying the state of my museum. Bugs, fossils, and fish-wise, I'm 100% complete, but my art gallery is perhaps 20% finished. So, I've started hitting Redd up on Harv's Island to see about changing that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I'm dipping into the Namco DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_namco_legendary_pack">Atari 50</a>, and the kids are intrigued by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>, so it might be time for a Reroll. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> marks a completely new story where the legendary bounty hunter Samus Aran is unexpectedly transported to the unknown planet Viewros. As you've probably already seen, she's also joined by a team of Galactic Federation soldiers.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-difficulty-settings-revealed-by-nintendo">same recently published article</a> on Nintendo's Japanese website, there's an official introduction to the team of soldiers who have also been transported to the same location. Throughout this new adventure, Samus will work and fight alongside all of these characters to return home alive.</p>
<p>If you don't want any <strong>spoilers</strong>, you might want to navigate away from this page right now. Below is a look at each of the Galactic Federation soldiers and a description. Apart from MacKenzie's description (based on the in-game logbook which has already been shared online), the other descriptions are <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/troopers/index.html">translated from Nintendo's website</a>.

<p>Whether you're a veteran of the series or just starting out, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will have a difficult to match your skill.</p>
<p>In a new article on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/ed98179e-b57e-4ae8-8ac5-3cdc5d721661">official Japanese Nintendo website</a>, the difficulty settings in Samus' new mission on Planet Viewros have been detailed. When you start this adventure, you will be able to select from either a 'casual' or 'normal' mode.</p>
<p>Casual mode will lower enemy HP and reduce the amount of damage Samus takes, and is recommended for first-time players. And as you probably guessed, normal mode offers the standard Metroid Prime experience. If you want a tougher challenge, once normal mode is cleared, you'll unlock hard mode.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>If you've played previous entries such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, these difficulty settings shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>
<p>The same post has also detailed how players will also be able to adjust certain other in-game settings. This includes the ability to fine-tune the sensitivity of the analog and mouse controls, which can help if you're struggling with movement or aiming.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to adjust the screen display and volume settings to your liking. You can see what else Nintendo has revealed about Metroid Prime 4: Beyond in our previous coverage.</p>
