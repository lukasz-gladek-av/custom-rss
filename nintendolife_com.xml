<p>In his monthly thread detailing sales figures and retail highlights, Piscatella confirms that a total of 1.6 million hardware units were sold across all platforms in the US during November. This is the lowest total since 1995, during which a total of 1.4 million units were sold.</p>
<p>To potentially explain this figure, Piscatella also notes that the average price paid for a new piece of hardware was "an all-time November high of $439", which is up 11% compared to a year ago.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7kxonjs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Looking at the data a bit closer, the PS5 managed to beat the Switch 2 to be the highest-selling platform during November, which is the first time Sony has managed such a feat since the launch of Nintendo's new console. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/xbox-series-xs-had-no-black-friday-deals-so-they-lost-to-a-console-weve-never-heard-of-us">the NEX Playground came in third place</a> in units sold, though the Xbox managed to bag third in dollars.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the highest-selling game of the month was, rather predictably, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Nintendo's highest-charting title was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

<p>You'll have to go in-store, though</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="bab6461c933b5"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Bag" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bab6461c933b5/resident-evil-requiem-bag.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We know what you're thinking... You don't need yet <em>another</em> reason to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, right? Well, you know us, we're here to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>GameStop has announced that it will be issuing a free tote bag (gasp!) for in-store pre-orders for Requiem on all available platforms. It depicts the ruined landscape of Racoon City with the game's title at the top. Form an orderly queue folks, come on now!</p>

<p>Look, to be serious for a moment, we know it's not the coolest pre-order bonus ever, but heck, it's free. For diehard fans of the series, it could be a cool little thing to hang off the end of a shelf, or something. We're grasping, sure, but still...</p>
<p>Regardless of where you wind up purchasing it, Resident Evil Requiem will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It sees the return of veteran Leon Kennedy and the introduction of FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, whose mother – Alyssa – was a key character in the classic PS2 title, Resident Evil: Oubreak.</p>
