<p>Kiwami 1 also getting a Switch 2 release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Kazuma Kiryu's story will continue on Switch 2 later this year as <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 2</strong> releases on 13th November 2025.</p>
<p>Continuing the story on from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> — a remake of the first Yakuza game that received a Switch port last year — Kiryu will be facing off against the Dragon of Kansai, Ryuji Goda.</p>
<p>Featuring improved combat and set in both Kamurocho and Sotenbori, this seems to be more of a straight port compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, which was a Switch 2 launch title. We're not complaining! Plus, we can play darts, karaoke, and golf.</p>


<p>If you haven't yet played the first Kiwami, you're in luck — Yakuza Kiwami is also coming to Switch 2! We're not sure whether it's getting a free upgrade, a paid upgrade, or a complete rerelease yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Still aiming for Winter</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo and Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> made a surprise appearance during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and while we still don't have a release date (This Winter is all we have), we did get a new trailer.</p>
<p>Largely a story-setting showcase, the trailer gives us a look at many of the game's playable characters, while re-establishing that yes, this is a canonical story that showcases the Imprisoning War.</p>
<p>Plus, it looks like we're getting a brand new Construct to play around with.</p>

<p>Very few other details were shared, so this trailer — and the reveal back in April — are all we have to go on right now. Still, we're looking forward to checking out what Zelda was up to during the Imprisoning War, and to better understanding what happened in the run-up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
