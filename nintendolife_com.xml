<p>Now that's worth buying a console for!</p>

We've spent the past few days pushing and pulling at our new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2s</a> as we get to figuring out just what this baby is really capable of. And, well, it seems as though it's capable of some quite twisted stuff.</p>
<p>Or at least <em>a bit mixed up</em>, as it turns out you can actually mix and match your Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-differences-how-do-the-new-controllers-compare">Switch 2 Joy-Con</a> as working pairs and get stuck into playing games and browsing the Switch 2 console menus in the manner of someone wearing two completely differently-sized gloves.</p>
<p>There's no real point to it - unless you can't find the Joy-Con 2 you're looking for or someone else is using it. Indeed, we hadn't even thought to check until we saw the r/NintendoSwitch post hanging below this sentence:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ulmjop&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Not wanting to simply take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l583dn/you_can_mix_and_match_switch_1_2_joycons_as_its/">u/iOvercompensate's</a> word without investigating a little further (no offence, we're just massively paranoid from existing in this timeline), we can confirm that we have achieved the same result. We were never in doubt.</p>

<p>In order to do the same, for whatever reason (maybe you've got relatives over and nobody is speaking anymore - a party trick might ease hostilities!), simply jump into the controller settings on Switch 2, then go to change your grip order, then press 'L' and 'R' to detect the Joy-Con you wish to mix. Ta-da!</p>
<p>Now. Does it work the other way, though? Can you go out and buy some fancy Switch 2 Joy-Con to use on your OG Switch?</p>

<p>Eh...no. No, you cannot. Silly us.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156548/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> was the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza</a> game — after many, many attempts on my part — that finally and fully opened my eyes to the magic of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's long-running (and entirely bats**t) franchise. This was the one that finally did me in.</p>
<p>And from the moment its <em>incredible</em> opening cutscene sequence kicks in, it's not hard to see why, it's not hard to know you're in the very best of company with Yakuza 0. It's a lavish, opulent, gritty, violent and wholly adult affair, that also happens to be incredibly cheesy, almost ludicrously silly, and full of good-intentioned heart. It's a complicated old thing, is this Yakuza malarkey.</p>
<p>On the topic of 'complicated', this is also a series that, for understandable reasons, I constantly see people wondering how or where to get started with. How do you approach it? Which game should you go with first? The answer, my friends, is simple. You start with Yakuza 0.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156546/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This majestic prequel gives you the Yakuza experience in its most coherent and well-rounded form (at least it did until <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> arrived, but that's another story). A properly epic gangster tale of the rise of Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima — two of gaming's great protagonists — as they battle on the mean streets of Tokyo and Osaka circa 1988, it sets the stage for all that follows in the series. Which is a lot. Oh boy, it's a lot.</p>
<p>Everything here, from the neon-soaked streets of its two impressively open locations, to the cast of absolute maniac criminal underworld characters you'll meet (and then likely kill), it feels, as all of these games do, weirdly authentic in its characterisations, and in the bizarre vibe it strikes, even though it's completely off-the-rails bonkers a lot of the time.</p>
<p>If you know Yakuza, you know the deal. It's a bit rough, rude, borderline pervy at times (although the devs have done very well in reigning this side in more recently), and it somehow manages to mix extremely cheesy (in the best way) dialogue, always fantastically acted, with serious real-world issues and the occasional bit of actual emotion.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156549/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kiryu and Majima are incredibly likeable characters to get stuck into controlling, too. They're cool, funny, dumb as the rest of us, and incredibly desperate to be loved. Just like me. It's a winning combo, especially when they also happen to be quite excellent at beating large gangs of armed thugs in combat that, back in 2015, was the most polished and absorbing the series had seen yet. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, you understand, but it feels slicker, the animations are better, and each of our protags has got three styles to fight in, giving you lots more options in how you want to approach battles than you may expect. This is a very, very well-made brawler, is what I'm saying.</p>
<p>Did you know that one of Majima's fighting stances is breakdancing, by the way? That's a good window into how silly this whole thing manages to be at all times. And who doesn't enjoy the franchise's signature environmental and weapons-based takedowns? Bike to the face, anyone? Traffic cone to the nuts? Come and get it, mate. And bring your pals.</p>
<p>It's also tickled us forever now, how none of these folk, no matter how badly you beat them off a storefront, ever die. It's just that kind of thing. Don't feel bad. They only die during big scenes. You can go ham with that cafe chair, he can't feel it.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156545/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Yakuza games have always chosen a pleasing sort of moment-to-moment depth over sheer size in terms of their open worlds, too. This most likely, of course, originates from technical limitations, but now in the modern-future-terror-world in which we currently exist, they continue to stick with this setup to an extent, and it pays dividends here (as it continues to with more recent entries, and flashy Yakuza spin-offs like the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/judgment">Judgment</a> series). Now I'm not saying the world isn't big and impressive — it is — it's just not gonna make you take a bike and cycle in a straight line for 40 minutes to your next objective.</p>
<p>With Ryu Ga Gotoku, you get locations that, whilst often a little smaller this way, come alive thanks to the fact they're stuffed full of NPCs to talk to, get to know, and have fun with. They've got bars to hang out and get drunk off your ass in. You can go play pool, darts, do some karaoke, hit a disco. And these are things you can get better at, and be rewarded for doing. They open up quests and embiggen your circle of (incredibly unstable and violent) friends.</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer golf? Poker? Fishing? What about arcades, mate? They've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/super_hang-on">Super Hang-On</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_out_run">Out Run</a>, to name a few. You might not know this yet if you haven't played the game in the past, but you're about to become fully addicted to the fantastic Cabaret Club minigame here. We won't spoil it.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156551/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The main narrative, which sees both our protagonists become embroiled in turf wars that push them into contact with one another, is as excellent as it ever is in these games. Like a great big OTT soap opera stuffed full of psychotic killers, men running around in nappies, a guy called Mr. Libido and...well...let's just say Michael Jackson may or may not show up and need your help killing some zombies.</p>
<p>The majesty (and sometimes surprising grimness) of the main story is offset by a ton of side stuff which, whilst sometimes quite filler-y in nature, is mostly composed of very entertaining and well-written diversions. This melding of kooky comedy, off-kilter weirdness, and serious criminal activity has served the series well for decades, and in Yakuza 0 it's perhaps at its finest, certainly in terms of the franchise before it branched out into the turn-based <strong>Like A Dragon</strong> games, which are now my personal faves.</p>
<p>In terms of this Director's Cut on Switch 2, well, we have been spoiled, my friends. In close-ups, this version looks as good, if not better, than Yakuza 0 running on a PS4. Docked mode sees slick 4K/60fps goodness, whilst in portable it looks pristine in ways I never thought possible. There are volumetric effects, shadows and reflections on advertising boards here that I definitely haven't seen before, and it all looks great.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156550/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>We also get a new mode in this Director's Cut, alongside a full English dub (it's really not good, with Kiryu being particularly terrible, but hey, at least the option is there!) and some 30 minutes or thereabouts of new story scenes. Nice! All of this stuff really is gravy, too, as this is perhaps the best of all the Yakuza games, certainly pre-Like A Dragon, and it's genuinely never looked or played nicer.</p>
<p>With regards to the new scenes specifically, I'm not gonna say anything about them, because it's spoiler town centre, but it's going to be interesting, to say the least, to see how fans who've played the game feel about the rearrangement of a certain incident. It's not a biggie to me, personally, but there is definitely going to be some push-back on this change, that much is for sure. It doesn't affect things in any way that would have me change my thoughts on the game, though, so don't stress if you're coming in fresh.</p>
<p>The new multiplayer mode, Red Light Raid, has been very quiet thus far when I've tried, but it does allow for solo raids, alongside online with randoms, or with friends locally. It's fine, a basic wave battle-typed affair that sees you earn money, which you then use to unlock and upgrade characters. It's a nice bonus, but it does feel throwaway, unless you decide to commit and rise through the online leaderboards.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156552/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Choosing a character (the game gives you a big juicy paycheck to get started, so you can pick a fancy one) sees you then jump into street scraps in a team of four. Enemy groups are impressively large, and there are tough bosses and other aspects thrown at you as you attempt to clear hordes before your timer/health run out. Again, it's <em>fine</em>, but I'm not gonna let it affect my overall opinion of the main game, as that's what we are all here for.</p>
<p>And so with that, it's a big score indeed for a big old package. This is a phenomenal game from opening cutscene to close, a true gangster epic that gives newcomers the perfect place to start with this evergreen series. In it's Switch 2 form, it also now represents my favourite way to play this one, reclining on my sofa whilst kicking Yakuza butt. Just like God intended.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza 0 is the best of the traditional-styled Yakuza games, with the most complex story and interesting characters of the lot. It's also the ideal place for newcomers to get started with this weird and wonderful series.</p>
<p>The new multiplayer mode is a little throwaway, for sure, and the fights do get repetitive (turn-based Yakuza FTW), but otherwise, this is a phenomenal port of an epic adventure that's now my favourite way to get down on the mean streets of 1980s Tokyo and Osaka.</p></section>

<figure><a title="switch 2 battery poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31fdc712f2c15/switch-2-battery-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With gamers across the globe now settling in to put their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles through their paces, we've been seeing a bunch of media outlets, alongside eager social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">Reddit</a> users, report in on how they're finding the battery life thus far.</p>
<p>For full transparency, we've yet to run a rigorous battery test here at Nintendo Life, but from this writer's personal experience it's taking around the two-hour mark roughly, to drain things right down whilst playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Our editor, Gavin, is getting about the same running <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>, too.</p>
<p>This may be disappointing, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-how-does-it-compare">it falls pretty much in-line with what we expected</a> given Nintendo's officially indicated <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">2-6 hours</a> estimates and roughly the same as Switch 1 (before it saw a few model revisions).</p>
<p>Gamers online are reporting roughly the same figures in some cases. However, there seems to be a growing number of folk saying that they aren't even managing to reach the magic 2-hour mark whilst playing bigger games.</p>

<p>Of course, with the fact Mario Kart World is such a big, beautiful, online sort of deal, we expect the battery to drain faster, but it's not great news to see that, in some scenarios, people apparently aren't getting two hours out of it.</p>
<p>What's more (and we can confirm this one), the battery in standby mode — when you've set your Switch 2 down for the evening — seems to be draining seriously quickly in some cases. It seems it goes from a full charge to 59% on some consoles doing this, (as it has done with mine left overnight).</p>

<p>Judging from some of the responses to the post above, there are a whole bunch of players who are finding that the battery is draining too quickly for their liking. Obviously, there are a lot of factors at work here; screen brightness, downloads running in the background, whether you're using GameChat, and so on, but there's a pattern of complaints developing.</p>
<p>We'll be carrying out some tests of our own and will return with our own official findings in due course. But, in the interim, we'd love to hear how you have found the battery so far. How's it been for Mario Kart? What about 'smaller' games? And, if you've had time to take note, how does the battery do whilst in rest mode?</p>



<hr>
<p><em>And make sure to let us know all about your experiences with the Switch 2 battery in the comments. Are some games giving you better results?</em></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156605/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of my favourite memories from the Switch 1 came from those opening few weeks following the launch in March 2017. Like everyone else, I was utterly glued to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, but I also poured a huge amount of time into Shin’en Multimedia’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. It was <em>the</em> game to showcase what the console was capable of in those early days, and the developer is back again with a launch title for Switch 2: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion.</a></p>
<p>Now, I know everybody has quite rightly been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> almost non-stop since the Switch 2 launched, but I’d be lying if I said it was my favourite racing game at launch (and no, it’s not <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> either). That honour goes to Fast Fusion. While somewhat slight in terms of content, this entry is the most accomplished yet, with astonishing visuals, rock-solid performance, and blisteringly fast racing.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's extremely familiar to Fast RMX veterans. You still race around tracks against CPU opponents while phasing between red and blue colours to benefit from boost pads on the ground. Picking up little energy orbs fills your boost meter, while pressing ‘R’ gives you a significant (albeit short) speed burst, quickly depleting your boost supply.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156604/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so good, then. The biggest change with the core gameplay is the ability to jump at any point. Honestly, when I first heard about this, I thought Shin’en had lost its marbles. Jumping? In a futuristic, high-speed racer? Madness! It turns out, however, that it works wonderfully well, adding an extra layer of strategy.</p>
<p>I should clarify that when I say ‘jump’, I’m not talking about the measly hop you might see in Mario Kart. Fast Fusion's jumps launch your vehicle meters into the air, giving you time to control your direction before landing. This has multiple uses: you can either use it to cross a deadly gap on the course, reach energy orbs way up high, or swap to an adjacent road to avoid obstacles or make use of a boost pad.</p>
<p>It’s got loads of potential, and I even noticed a few moments in which I could cut corners or discover hidden shortcuts. Granted, there’s nothing quite like the astonishing feats seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/f-zero_x">F-Zero X</a>, but I reckon it’s possible to cut your times dramatically once you master the mechanic. You can also use it to land on top of your enemies, spinning them out and netting you some sweet cash. Very satisfying.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156603/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the tracks themselves, you've got a total of 12 split across 4 different leagues. It's definitely a step down from previous games, but the quality on display here is insane. The torrential rain and tornadoes in Tempesta are a real visual treat, and the gigantic robots stomping around Port Genkai can do a number on you. It's thrilling stuff, and with Shin'en confirming that free content updates are on the way, we're optimistic that there'll be additional tracks in the future.</p>
<p>Outside of races, the big change here is — as the title suggests — the ability to fuse vehicles to create completely new ones. You’ve only got a few unlocked from the start, but you can tinker with the fusion mechanic straight away, provided you have the currency. It’s simply a case of selecting which vehicle you want to alter and browsing the rest of the catalogue.</p>
<p>Completing the fusion results in a mash-up of both the designs and names. You’ll also see that some of the stats have been altered depending on your chosen vehicles’ strengths. Blending Cebra Genetics with Vasp Optics, for example, yields increased boost performance thanks to the latter’s strength in that department. There are loads of different combinations you can try out, and it’s a joy to see what kind of stunning monstrosity you can come up with; you may even find you can completely max out your acceleration or top speed.</p>

<p>Fusing does, however, cost money; in fact, everything in this game costs money. Not real money, before you grab your pitchforks, but in-game currency obtained by competing in races, performing well, and collecting items. You’ll need moolah to unlock new vehicles, complete fusions, and open up new Championship cups. The game is pretty generous with its cash prizes, but I felt deflated a couple of times realising I had to replay tracks I’d already won to grind the required funds.</p>
<p>Once you get over that initial hump of unlocking every track, however, accumulating currency is pretty painless, and you’ll find that playing races for the sheer thrill of it will soon result in heaps of the stuff. Another good way to spend it is via the Jukebox feature. Fast Fusion contains some awesome new music, and you can unlock it to listen to whenever you like, along with a whole bunch of tracks from Fast RMX, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/fast_racing_neo">FAST Racing NEO</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/fast_racing_league">Fast Racing League</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard Championship mode, you’ve also got Time Attack and Super Hero Mode. The former is pretty self-explanatory, requiring you to beat the stages’ record time, while the latter is about as close as we’re likely to get to a new F-Zero. The stages are mirrored, and your boost bar also represents your ship's health. Boost too much (or crash out entirely) and it’s game over. Generally, you’re able to boost much more than in the standard Championship mode, but it also comes with that thrilling risk vs. reward structure that makes F-Zero so great.</p>

<p>And of course, you’ve got multiplayer, offered up via standard splitscreen play (up to four players) or the new GameShare capabilities (two players). Splitscreen works phenomenally well with performance maintained at a solid 60fps for all. It’s not often you get such robust performance with local multiplayer these days, so seeing the Switch 2 handle this without breaking a sweat is a joy.</p>
<p>GameShare is similarly impressive in terms of performance, though being the second player on a Switch 1 does yield some pretty fuzzy visuals thanks to the streaming involved. The whole screen also shrinks slightly for both players to provide the necessary GameShare information at the top. It’s not a huge deal, and you’re going to find the same happens if you’re using the screen-share feature during GameChat, but it’s worth noting all the same.</p>
<p>While on the subject of performance, it’s worth just stressing how incredibly beautiful Fast Fusion is on the Switch. In docked mode, if you have a TV capable of hitting 4K resolution, nailing that 4K/60fps balance is absolutely magical. Shin’en Multimedia has stated its desire to potentially add in a 120fps mode at a later date, but honestly, if this means dipping the resolution down to 1080p, I’m perfectly happy sticking to 4K/60fps.</p>

<p>As for the other performance modes, you’ve got ‘Ultra Quality’ in docked mode that boosts the visuals slightly, but brings the performance down to 30fps. It’s fine, and the added texture details and shadow maps are certainly noticable, but it's not my go-to option.</p>
<p>Handheld mode delivers more or less the same, maxing out at the screen’s 1080p display while offering up the option of either a 60fps performance mode or a 30fps quality mode. The latter again offers the same visual upgrades as docked mode, but the compromises to attain this aren’t really worth it.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fast Fusion may not have the most comprehensive collection of tracks, but it's easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far. The new jump ability adds a new layer of strategy to the gameplay, while experimenting with the fusion mechanic to find the perfect vehicle is a joy. The occasional grinding to save up money can be a momentary drag, but if you're after something a bit more 'hardcore' than Mario Kart World, Fast Fusion is a no-brainer, and an absolute must-buy.</p></section>
