<p>Focused on expanding anime IP and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Digimon Story Time Stranger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd357dd40df66/digimon-story-time-stranger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some more Sony news, the PlayStation maker has this week acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>It's described as a "strategic business alliance agreement" with a focus on "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement". It reportedly sets Sony back "around $464 million" (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712901/sony-buys-a-stake-in-bandai-namco">via The Verge</a>).</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco and Sony have historically collaborated on various projects in the fields such as games, anime and music, and they plan to extend this collaboration to a broader range of areas. The two companies intend to implement initiatives including the expansion of works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising. They also plan to engage in detailed discussions regarding the joint development and promotion of IP such as anime and manga, in addition to planning and technical collaboration on experiential entertainment. Furthermore, the two companies plan to explore opportunities to support creators by jointly developing and operating entertainment-related technologies and services, and to engage in joint investments and business alliances in fan engagement areas."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony has previously invested in Kadakowa (the parent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> developer FromSoftware) in a new "alliance" last year.</p>
<p>As our pals at Pure Xbox mention, this latest partnership makes "transmedia opportunities" tied to areas like anime and manga "the priority". Sony also owns platforms like the anime streaming service <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>, which is available as an app on multiple platforms including Switch.</p>

<p>"Your memories will be recorded here"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>This year marks the tenth anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> and the game's creator Toby Fox is wanting to reflect on this time with your memories.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1948945089939788235">post on social media</a>, he's revealed how he's seeking "your memories" and wants to "turn back together". He's hoping for a quick turnover – further noting how it would be "great" if fans could submit their responses within the <strong>next 24 hours</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> "Hello. It's almost been 10 years since UNDERTALE released. Now, I'm looking for your memories. Let's turn back together. Face the flower and speak."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems the website where you can record your memory is already being overloaded with responses as well, so try again later if you have any trouble submitting your memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are so many submissions, the site is having trouble... If your submission is stuck on 'Submitting', please try sending it again later. Your submission should be auto-saved in your browser."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So head on over to <a href="https://memories.undertale.com/">memories.undertale.com</a> and record your memory now!</p>
<p>Although it has been almost ten years since original release, this title didn't arrive on the Switch eShop until 2018. It's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/sans_from_undertale_is_coming_to_super_smash_bros_ultimate">led to cameos</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and Toby releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, which was recently made available on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-lots-of-pokemon-champions-details-leaked/">as highlighted by Nintendo Everything</a>, there are supposedly new details about the game emerging. This information is apparently based on some previous leaks, which have now at least been "partially verified" following the latest broadcast:<strong><br></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Everything:</strong> "During the broadcast, The Pokemon Company shared more information about the battle-focused game. One of the things we heard about are Victory Points, which were accurately described in the leaks."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While we won't be directly sharing the <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-lots-of-pokemon-champions-details-leaked/">gameplay or content leaks</a> here, we will mention how the leak claims the release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a> is early next year. Additionally, it's expected to be a free download on all platforms, including Switch 2.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a rumour for now, so nothing mentioned in the leak has been officially confirmed (<em>at least yet</em>).</p>
<p>Previous news about Pokémon Champions has revealed there will be certain limitations when this game does arrive, with only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/pokemon-champions-limited-to-select-pokemon-at-launch">"select Pokémon" to be available</a> for use at launch, with plans to seemingly expand the roster as time goes on.</p>

<figure><a title="Helldivers 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6b508f7a0142/helldivers-2.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Sony surprised the video game community earlier this month when it was revealed it would be bringing Arrowhead's multiplayer hit <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/helldivers_2">Helldivers 2</a></strong> to Xbox.</p>
<p>Now, in another development, a <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5587289004">new job opening</a> has been spotted for PlayStation's head office, and it's apparently searching for a director to lead PlayStation's exploration of systems beyond the PS5 (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/sony-job-listing-implies-more-ps5-exclusives-will-be-ported-to-xbox-nintendo">thanks, Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>The description mentions how this role will shape and execute the company's global commercial strategy for "PS Studios software titles" across all digital platforms (including Nintendo), and will lead a team "focused on multiplatform expansion".</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6euxilrg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Reporting to the Vice President, Commercial Management as Senior Director of Multiplatform &amp; Account Management, you will play a critical leadership role in shaping and executing the global commercial strategy for PS Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile. This role is accountable for optimising title profitability, ensuring cross-functional alignment, and leading a high-performing team focused on multiplatform expansion, mid-range commercial planning, and platform partner management."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This role will also reportedly include maintaining relationships with rival platform holders, with the application name-dropping Nintendo twice.</p>
<p>This latest listing follows Sony previously releasing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> on the Switch. It's also been making its first-party console exclusives available on PC for some time now, and is again branching out with Helldivers 2, which offers live service content.</p>
<p>As our colleagues at Push Square have noted, the advertised role doesn't necessarily confirm a shift or change in Sony's current strategy, and it could simply be planning to continue what it's been doing up until now.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws releases on Switch 2 this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/343efa136838a/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot mentioned recently how he was hopeful the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> could <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/ubisofts-yves-guillemot-is-hopeful-that-upcoming-switch-2-port-can-revive-star-wars-outlaws">potentially revive the game</a>. While there's always a chance, beyond this adventure, the future doesn't sound very promising for Kay Vess and Nix.</p>
<p>According to a new scoop by Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, a sequel to Outlaws was originally planned but was recently scrapped in the "very early" stages. This information was shared on the <a href="https://youtu.be/1bFaIYn9H3g">same outlet's weekly podcast</a>. Here's exactly what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They [Ubisoft] also recently cancelled Star Wars Outlaws 2, because that was planned and in the works. It didn’t enter production, as far as I know. It wasn’t set in stone."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/ubisofts-disastrous-2024-may-lead-to-the-company-going-private">hasn't had the best run over the past year</a> – with multiple titles, including Star Wars Outlaws, falling short of the company's financial expectations, along with delays of games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> (a title which could also potentially be on the way to the Switch 2 in the future).</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will launch for the Switch 2 on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>. If we hear anything else about the supposed sequel and its cancellation, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Nintendo bolstered the Switch 2 library this week with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>.</p>
<p>Now that the reviews have been released, and everyone has had some time to check them out, we're curious to know if you're planning on getting the Switch 2 version, the upgrade, or will you be sticking with the original version for now.</p>

<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-version-revisitee-de-plants-vs-zombies-en-approche-on-vous-revele-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-60272">Dealabs and Billbil-Kun</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/plants-vs-zombies-appears-ready-to-return-in-leaked-ps5-remaster">Push Square</a>), the remaster is reportedly called <strong>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</strong> — which could be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/plants-vs-zombies-looks-set-to-be-revived-and-reloaded-on-switch">related to the Brazilian age rating of Reloaded</a>, discovered earlier this year.</p>
<p>If the leak is correct, EA and PopCap Games' remaster of the 2009 tower defense game will be launching on Switch on 23rd October 2025 for 19,99 €. We'll also be hearing about Replanted officially within the next month — that could mean Gamescom, but it could also mean <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">a Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fuvjxgp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA87rC9nG4k" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted was originally spotted on EA's servers very briefly, before the publisher removed it. Not before video footage of the game being discovered was shared online, of course (above).</p>
<p>So it seems pretty inevitable, then. The original game was available on DS and DSiWare, but hasn't been made available on other Nintendo consoles. Considering how well loved the OG is, the remaster will probably be pretty well received.</p>
