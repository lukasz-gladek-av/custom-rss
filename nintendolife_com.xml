<p>Howdy, partners!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="ea95192144bd1"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ea95192144bd1/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, we had an inkling that it might be on the horizon, and Nintendo has just made it official. A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has been announced for <strong>Thursday, 5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The Direct will kick off at <strong>2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 6am PT</strong>, and it promises "roughly 30 minutes" of news and announcements for third-party games heading to Switch 2 and Switch 1. As ever, you'll be able to watch along on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a>, your regional variant, or on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>
<p>Here's when the Direct will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Fri) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As for what the showcase will contain, your guess is as good as ours! There are still some third-party big hitters in the pipeline that we feel are probably due a new info dump — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> etc. — and we're still waiting on amiibo news for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>. Then again, it could be something completely new! Ports feel so much more possible on the new system, so we've got our fingers crossed for some sky-high dreams.</p>

<p>Investors be fickle</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="27c7018aad0d4"><a title="Mario Toy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27c7018aad0d4/mario-toy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo released its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf">financial report</a> this week for Q3 of fiscal year 2026, confirming that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/switch-2-storms-towards-its-forecast-target-with-17-37-million-units-sold">Switch 2 has sold 17.38 million units</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all of the numbers going up, investors have nevertheless flinched at immediate market conditions and ongoing concerns around component prices. As such, Nintendo's share price has dropped pretty significantly, currently sitting at 8,973 JPY compared to a high of 10,180 JPY on Tuesday afternoon, representing a fall of just over 11%.</p>
<p>It shows just how fickle investors can be, and Nintendo's newly released <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf">Q&amp;A</a> (currently only available in Japanese) contains several questions relating to component prices and profits. In addition, one could argue that the Switch 2 is currently lacking a major upcoming first-party release, and Nintendo's signature secrecy around its plans means that investors really have no clue as to how the coming months might play out.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b4c416c390e03"><a title="Nintendo Share Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b4c416c390e03/nintendo-share-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj99ffD9b-SAxW3nf0HHZHyA8MQ3ecFKAN6BAgoEAQ">Google Finance</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've seen this all before, and we'll see it again. Nintendo's share price reached record highs in 2025 as excitement for the Switch 2 reached fever pitch, but it's since dropped to more familiar levels in the following months. No doubt we'll see another spike as Nintendo announces more games throughout 2026, and it'll probably fall again soon after. On it goes.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, has stressed that increasing memory prices <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-will-carefully-consider-a-switch-2-price-increase-says-furukawa">will have no immediate impact</a> on the company's financial performance, though acknowledged that it may put pressure on profits from FY2027 onwards.</p>
<p>Right now, we think it's probably wise to just keep cool and wait for Nintendo to reveal its plans for the rest of the year – whenever that may be.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: The Perfect Pencil (Switch) - A Sharp, Horror-Tinged Metroidvania With Splashes Of Hollow Knight]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-perfect-pencil</link>
            <guid>1425091</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Metroidvania revival (did it ever really go away?) keeps rolling, and here comes another stylised combat-platformer where a strange little hero gets lost in a dark, labyrinthine fantasy world.</p>
<p>This time, our protagonist is John, who stumbles into a bizarre realm full of somnambulist weirdos and giant babies. Studio Cima has crafted a disturbing, stylised trip that deftly builds on themes of psychological trauma and fear. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/perfect_pencil">The Perfect Pencil</a> can be pretty impenetrable at times, but it stays compelling throughout.</p>
<p>John’s actual goal is never fully clear, which only adds to the fever-dream vibe of the world he wanders through. Initially headless, he acquires an old projector for a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bonce">bonce</a> and ventures out armed with nothing but a giant pencil.</p>
<p>Bedtime iconography is everywhere: NPCs speak in riddles, and you’re never totally sure who’s trying to help you and who’s planning to stab you in the back. Both enemies and allies are equally creepy. John meets dead‑eyed sleepwalkers wrapped in random junk, or oddball creatures offering to teach him martial arts.</p>
<p>The Camera Obscura atop John’s neck lets him scan the environment, which helps with navigating the (sometimes pretty convoluted) map and uncovering secrets tied to the main quest.</p>
<p>While a lot of recent Metroidvanias lean heavily on tough combat and tricky platforming chains, The Perfect Pencil is more focussed on exploration. You’ll poke around its surreal dreamscape, run side‑tasks for NPCs, and upgrade John’s projector with ability‑boosting filaments.</p>
<p>There’s still a solid amount of combat as you battle with those sleepy enemies scattered across the games diverse biomes. They’re not especially tough, but their placement can lead to some annoying deaths and long runbacks. Boss fights are fun setpieces with bigger enemies that are literal manifestations of the game’s themes. Like their smaller counterparts, they also love flattening John and sending him back to distant save points.</p>
<p>John fights these Tim Burton‑esque foes with a simple melee offence. His most useful skill is a heal strike that converts the energy from consecutive attacks into a health‑restoring hit. It’s a neat ability that stays handy throughout the game. His attacks can be upgraded by spending a resources scattered throughout the levels and by defeating enemies.</p>
<p>Combat and traversal across this uniquely designed world feels smooth in both handheld and docked modes, with zero performance issues. This has none of the razors-edge twitchiness of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">Mio</a>, but it's nice to see the painstaking art style in clear detail during John's tribulations. The Switch continues to be a comfortable home for artistically-driven Metroidvanias.</p>
<p>Despite being another in an ever increasing genre stable, The Perfect Pencil brings a uniquely twisted world to the genre. Its mysteries can be a bit dense, but the eerie atmosphere, complex themes, and strange landscapes make it worth exploring.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-perfect-pencil]]></content:encoded>
