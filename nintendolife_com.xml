<p>Multiple revived and enhanced titles are on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nitrome, the talented British indie developer currently crafting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> for the Switch 2, has this week announced a new series.</p>
<p>Nitrome Classics revives a range of titles from <a href="https://www.nitrome.com/">Nitrome's past</a> and is "lovingly" porting them to the Nintendo Switch and other platforms with various enhancements and updates. More platform releases could also "potentially" follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All of the games are not just meticulously restored but improved with higher frame rates, full screen aspect ratios and with higher quality music. Many of the games will be packaged as mini collections within a franchise and include additional content not found in the original release."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game in this series is <strong>Twin Shot Deluxe</strong> (a title which began life on web browsers), and it will be released in "early" 2026. <strong>Silly Sausage</strong> and <strong>Skywire</strong> will follow this game. Here are the details about the first title on the way (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618520/Twin_Shot_Deluxe/">via Steam</a>), and you can check out a trailer of this new Classics series above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Angel Cats are back and better than ever before in this complete remaster.</p>
<p><em>Twin Shot Deluxe</em> is an arcade platform shooter where players defend their homeland from invaders using bows and arrows. Take aim at over 200 brand new levels set across four worlds, each with unique challenges, bosses and enemies. Play solo or team up with friends in local cooperative play (one-to-four players) or play competitively to see who will be crowned champion.</p>
<p>A brand new Atlantis theme to explore, defeat additional bosses, unlock fancy headwear with special powers for extended replay, and much more… relive your childhood and take to the skies!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can also expect new bosses, cheats as well as a graphical overhaul – including a frame rate and resolution update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We could not leave the game lagging in the past at 20 frames per second, it has now been upgraded to an angelic 60 frames per second, and now with a modern 16:9 ratio—that’s 78 percent more <em>Twin Shot</em>. We even have a brand new intro animatic and ending illustrations remastered to pixel art perfection."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from the upcoming Switch 2 release Mouse Work, which utilises Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Nitrome is the same team that has previously worked on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bomb_chicken">Bomb Chicken</a>.</p>

<h3>Pikmin 4 - Version 1.1.1 (16th December 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>Fix Related to Giving Oatchi Commands</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now give the “Go to Work” command to Oatchi in your squad right away when you keep pressing the A Button after throwing all of the Pikmin in your squad.
<ul>
<li>For tasks where there aren’t enough Pikmin, or things Oatchi is unable to do, the command will still be stopped temporarily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Roll Overs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you start a new game with Roll Over, you can now carry over all of Oatchi’s previously learned skills.
<ul>
<li>Speak to the captain and go into the training screen after Oatchi grows and you are able to do training.</li>
<li>Note: You cannot perform Roll Over starts in the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some treasures are not reflected in the completion of the Treasure Catalog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Creature Activity Levels</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the activity level is set to “Relaxed,” the following creatures will no longer attack unless you attack them first.
<ul>
<li>Moss</li>
<li>Waterwraith</li>
<li>Dweevils Carrying Bomb Rocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While the activity level is set to “Relaxed,” creatures are less likely to inhale Pikmin or catch them with their tongues.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Grubchucker is unable to prey on Pikmin while the activity level is set to “Fierce.”</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some creatures would freeze in place when fed multiple Bomb Rocks while the activity level is set to “Fierce.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Decor Pikmin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made it easier to “Say Cheese” when taking pictures of some Decor Pikmin.</li>
<li>Decor Pikmin are now unaffected when a creature performs an attack where they suck in Pikmin.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where there was sometimes a delay in reflecting what Decor Pikmin you have found when sending that data to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.
<ul>
<li>Note: Decor Pikmin data cannot be sent to Pikmin Bloom from the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Auto Target Lock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a setting that makes it so the cursor is not locked in place from repeatedly pressing the A Button while Auto Target Lock is set to “Off.”
<ul>
<li>Note: You can switch between “On” and “Off” by opening the Pause menu (- Button), selecting “Settings,” and going to “Tap A Repeatedly to Lock.” (This is set to “Off” by default.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Button Guide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation will now appear in screen while in “Photo Mode” when using the Field Camera indicating that you can move the camera up or down using the up and down direction buttons on the Joy-Con (L) (or the up and down buttons on the +Control Pad of the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed other issues to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A patch with the same changes has also been distributed for the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo. The demo version cannot send Decor Pikmin information to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.</p>
<hr>
<p>This follows recent calls from fans for a Switch 2 upgrade for Pikmin 4, after an odd listing was spotted on the eShop earlier this month.</p>
<p>In some other update news, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_tennis_aces">Mario Tennis Aces</a> on the Switch has been <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29137">updated to Version 3.1.1</a> today.
