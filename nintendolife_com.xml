<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d89a19f59ee34/super-adventure-island-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</a> for the GBA – a true classic and one of our favourites here at NL Towers. North America and Europe joined forced against Japan and, uh... Oh, poor Japan. The western design won with a whopping 91% of the vote! We quite like the Japanese design, there's definitely something to it. Though if you said it was boring, we wouldn't necessarily disagree. Hm.</p>
<p>Anyway, this week, we're going back to the SNES to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_adventure_island">Super Adventure Island</a>. Developed by Produce! and published by Hudson Soft in 1992, it boasted some really lovely, colourful visuals and the platforming gameplay was pretty decent.</p>
<p>It's a three-way brawl this week folks, so get ready to vote, vote, vote!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:16309 @ 1755424802 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/538a5c2430ae3/super-adventure-island-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so starting with North America, the artistic approach here is wildly different to that seen in Europe and Japan. After the initial whiplash, however, it's actually quite a cool image. More details become apparent the longer you look at it, like the characters in the background, the mine cart track swooping off into the distance, the 'leafy' title font... It's pretty cool.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a2a3a2c93c36/super-adventure-island-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So this one is a lot more, shall we say, 'cartoon-ish' than the North American variant. There are a handful of characters taking up the composition, including a couple of rather delightful turtles wearing shades. It's definitely a lot more colourful, although we'll have to dock a point for the rather boring title font.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8138a55c4a9c5/super-adventure-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Utilising the portrait orientation of the SNES packaging in Japan, this variant uses the same art style seen in Europe's design, but the added space allows for a lot more characters to be depicted. The giant skeleton thing on the right really draws the eye, and the use of colour is perhaps even more effective here.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-super-adventure-island-snes]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Season 21 will run indefinitely"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ninjala" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f1f51dc20ebf/ninjala.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: GungHo Online Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>GungHo Online's free-to-play multiplayer title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninjala">Ninjala</a> is now in its fifth year, and it looks like the development team will be winding down major support after 21 seasons.</p>
<p>In a new update, bumping the game up to Version 21.0, an <a href="https://ninjalathegame.com/en/news/info/season21.html">official announcement</a> mentions how the team has decided Season 21 and the latest Ninjala Pass will "run indefinitely".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for playing Ninjala. The Ninjala Team has an announcement regarding the duration of Season 21.</p>
<p>In order to provide all Ninjala users with an enjoyable experience and stable service over the long term, we have decided Season 21 will run indefinitely.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kvjqyu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, the Season 21 Ninjala Pass will also last indefinitely. We will still continue to hold various events such as WNA Tours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The servers for Ninjala <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjalaTheGame/comments/1mpvum3/season_21_ends_in_12_years/">apparently won't be going away</a> anytime soon. The title even received a Switch 2 compatibility update on 19th June 2025 - fixing some "previously identified issues".</p>
<p>This bubblegum ninja game was released for free on the Switch eShop in June 2020, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/ninjalas_release_gets_delayed_until_june_due_to_the_coronavirus_outbreak_gungho_president_apologises">after multiple delays</a>. When Ninjala was initially revealed, it was often compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a> – with GungHo's CEO Kazuki Morishita <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/06/ninjala_isnt_really_like_splatoon_but_wed_love_to_do_a_crossover_says_gungho_ceo">describing it as being "very different".</a></p>
<p>In our review of the game here on Nintendo Life around the time of its release, we awarded Ninjala seven out of ten stars.</p>

<figure><a title="Feature: 32 Games We're Dying To See On Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eef768fd91eff/feature-32-games-were-dying-to-see-on-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first months of Switch 2's life have seen plenty of multiplatform games arrive on Nintendo's newest console — winners like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> to name a handful — and its extra power affords devs the chance to bring newer, bigger, more ambitious games to the platform where ports simply weren't viable on the old Switch.</p>
<p>And yes, we've got things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars: Outlaws</a> to look forward to before the year's out, but we're an insatiable bunch, always wanting more, more, <em>moaaaaar.</em> Honestly, we thought we'd see a few more big-name ports announced during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Partner Showcase</a>, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-reportedly-announce-more-game-ports-for-other-platforms-soon">zero announcements from Microsoft</a> thus far, we're expecting plenty MORE to come throughout the rest of the year.</p>
<p>So here, Team NL presents our <em>most</em> wanted Switch 2 ports. We're not begging — eight years of <em>'Switch when?'</em> have taken their toll on us, too. But hey, our machines are shiny and new and we're jonesing to play some of the following on them...</p>
<div><div><h2>Alan Wake 2</h2>

<div><p>If the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alan_wake_remastered">Alan Wake</a> was a good game, then its sequel is a <em>great</em> one. It leans heavily into survival horror, but the way in which it weaves two parallel storylines is simply marvelous.</p><p>

The visuals are stunning, so a bit of jiggery-pokery might be needed to get it running well, but as long as it’s not comparable to the visual dumpster fire that is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alan_wake_remastered">Alan Wake Remastered</a> on the Switch, then we’re all good. <em>OR</em></p></div>
</div><div><h2>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2>

<p>It seems almost inevitable that <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> will make its way to the Switch 2, so why not start with the latest mainline entry? I haven’t played <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Shadows</a> yet, but it seems to be quite an ambitious experience; one that may well push the Switch 2 toward its limits.</p>
<p>I’m happy to give it a shot on Nintendo’s console, though! I love getting lost in a huge, authentic open world, and what Ubisoft has seemingly accomplished with this one is nothing short of extraordinary. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Baldur's Gate 3</h2>

<p>The Game of the Year winner that brought D&amp;D to the masses back in 2023 and stole my heart with its endless possibilities. The indecisive part of me restarted my file with a different character type at least five times back on PS5, and while I'm hesitant that Switch 2 could run <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> properly without some serious cutbacks, I'd be willing to make it a sixth on the hybrid.</p>
<p>You know, for science. <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Blue Prince</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> is one of those games where you're best going in knowing as little as possible. It's a puzzler, it's a roguelike, it's a reason to fill up a notebook with some of the most indecipherable scribblings I've ever put to paper.</p>
<p>This one got under my skin and wouldn't let me go until I had solved some of its mysteries, and a Switch 2 port would only keep the madness spreading. <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>

<p>Which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/call_of_duty_4_modern_warfare">Call of Duty</a>? Now that's a question for another time, but this series, now that Switch 2 can give us the framerates and online performance it requires, could be a big hit on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>I'd love to be able to kick back with any of the older games for starters, especially <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/call_of_duty_advanced_warfare">Advanced Warfare</a> (a.k.a the best one), but the real magic, would come in a super solid and slick port of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/call_of_duty_warzone">Call of Duty Warzone</a>. I love this multiplayer slice of CoD, it's the only way I get my fix of it these days, and in portable it could prove to be really hard to put down. Oh, and with gyro aiming? *swoon* <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> is <em>the</em> video game of the moment; almost four months after its release, this French-developed turn-based RPG is still dominating conversations The combat is terrific and the music is <em>phenomenal</em> (please, just listen to the track <a href="https://youtu.be/zmvsw2ILX5k?si=m2UcW7jF855V3OiU">Lumière</a>), but what makes this game so special to me is its story. What it has to say about grief, family, trauma, and how everything is meticulously plotted and paced. Sure, there are plenty of rough edges, but this might be the best debut from a studio in… forever?</p>
<p>More people should play it, and it feels like a no-brainer to bring it to Switch 2. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Death Stranding (2)</h2>

<p>Kojima loves the smell of his own and that winds me up, but there is an unhinged ambition to him that I admire even if I struggle to enjoy it. We're all better off for having him working in games, and having heard discussion around his latest WTFFest, I'm intrigued to experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>I'd take <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a> given the choice between 1 and 2. I'm not sure I could manage both. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>DOOM: The Dark Ages</h2>

<p>We’ve got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>. We’ve got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_eternal">DOOM: Eternal</a>. We’ve got all the old <strong>DOOM</strong>s. Let’s make it complete with a port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, hm? Given that the 2016 reboot and its 2020 sequel ran surprisingly well on the Switch, I think The Dark Ages could hold its own on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>And what a game! I know it’s proven to be quite divisive, but it’s my personal favourite of the modern trilogy. I love how <em>heavy</em> it feels compared to the zippy, floaty gameplay in Eternal, and I’ll never tire of ramming into a group of enemies with my shield. Delightfully gory stuff. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>El Paso, Elsewhere</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/el_paso_elsewhere">El Paso, Elsewhere</a> launched on PC and Xbox in September 2023, so it's been a while. The devs, Strange Scaffold, have been busy since then with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">TMNT: Tactical Takedown</a> — which is great, by the way — but perhaps they'd consider bringing this neo-noir homage to <strong>Max Payne</strong> (you know, with vampires) to Switch 2. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Fallout: New Vegas</h2>

<p>Usually I'd go for the newest, biggest and slickest entry in a series for my dream port, but here it's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_new_vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> that I'm plumping for, because it's the best one.Thanks.</p>
<p>Yes, it may not look the best - although they all look the same in my opinion, so that helps - but this spin-off has the best characters, writing and choice-driven shenanigans of the lot. Put it on Switch 2 and I will happily play it another couple of times, just to see all the stuff I missed back in ye olden days. PJ</p>
</div><div><h2>Final Fantasy XIV</h2>

<p>I know I <em>could</em> say <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, but the real, best modern Final Fantasy (that isn’t <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Rebirth</a>, and that’s basically guaranteed to come to Switch 2) is a big ol’ MMORPG.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, particularly the <strong>Shadowbringers</strong> and <strong>Endwalker</strong> expansions, touches on all the things I love in storytelling. There’s also just <em>so</em> much to do too, with fun callbacks to the entire series, and so many jobs and crafters to play around with. I’d love to be able to play FFXIV in handheld, and getting it on this new console would be a dream. Put in the effort, and the journey's worth it. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Forza</h2>

<p>As an occasional Forza fan (I played <strong>2</strong> to death, and I bought and enjoyed <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/forza_horizon_4">Horizon 4</a> quite a bit), I'd love to have the series arrive on Switch 2 and bolster a genre which had <em>some</em> bright lights on Switch 1 (hello, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/burnout_paradise_remastered">Burnout Paradise</a>), but which were few and far between.</p>
<p>There's a gap in the library and Microsoft could fill it. That is assuming there's anybody left at any of their studios to work up the port. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Grand Theft Auto 6</h2>

<p>I didn't like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/grand_theft_auto_v">GTA 5</a> much. Sorry, I just really hated Trevor, so I never finished up the story. But, this doesn't mean I ain't excited for the new one, or that I'm not a huge fan of the series, because I am!</p>
<p>However, I am yearning for Rockstar's brand of madness, and I'm really excited about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Now, imagine if they managed to shrink it all down and put it on the Switch 2 so I can play it whilst out and about in my actual hood. We've yet to learn all that much about the game, but I daresay it's gonna be quite the behemoth, and a looker to boot, so I'm gonna suggest we forget about the ray-tracing and it'll all be grand. I am so down with the technical side of things. <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</h2>

<p>Right, listen. <strong>Halo</strong>’s going multiplatform. I know it’s not been officially confirmed yet, but it’s happening. With <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/forza_horizon_5">Forza Horizon 5</a> now on PlayStation and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War</a> shortly making the jump, Halo is seemingly the last bastion of major Xbox exclusives. But not for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-insider-claims-that-halo-master-chief-collection-will-come-to-switch-2">Rumours have already proliferated</a> indicating that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> will soon come to Switch 2, and I reckon it would be the perfect fit. The system is leagues above what the Xbox One could manage, so theoretically every game could run at a slick 4K/60fps, or maybe even 120fps. I personally dive into the original Bungie trilogy at least once a year, so playing them on the go on the Switch 2 sounds like a dream come true. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Hi-Fi Rush</h2>

<p>I’m not sure why no one has ever come up with a rhythm-action game before, but <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> oozes charm, attitude, and personality. I love everything about the look of this game, from the bright aesthetic, the selection of music, to the rocking original compositions. So why on earth haven’t I played this yet?</p>
<p>I admit, it’s because I <em>thought</em> this would come to Switch, but after Tango Gameworks was shut down — then saved from the brink – I think we’re in for a shot on Switch 2. After all, we all deserve to spend time with 808 and Chai, right? <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Hotel Barcelona</h2>

<p>This collaboration between SWERY and Suda51 is one of the most exciting-looking games on any system in my book. I have no idea if the end result will live up to the trailer's showcasing of the creators' patented weirdness (and those side-on bits admittedly look a little rote), but I'd love to find out on a Switch. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Immortality</h2>

<p>We can already play Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/telling_lies">Telling Lies</a> on Switch 2 via backwards compatibility, and if there's no chance of Sam Barlow's <strong>Her Story</strong> making a return, Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/immortality">Immortality</a> — a fascinating lost-footage mystery game that launched to great acclaim elsewhere in 2022 — would be a super sub.</p>
<p>I also think it's time for the Sid Meier-isation of Sam Barlow. Get your name on the game, Sam. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>

<p>I expected this one to be a damp squib, given the initial trailers and Microsoft's run of luck the last couple of years, so it was a welcome surprise to hear that, actually, the first-person Indy game was good. Great, even! It's out on PS5 already, and Microsoft is keen to put games on any device that'll run 'em, and this would be the <em>perfect</em> present to enjoy over the holidays this year.</p>
<p>You know, maybe it makes <em>too much</em> sense. Hopefully I haven't jinxed it. <em>GL</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>

<p>I didn't have time to check out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/kingdom_come_deliverance_ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> when it arrived on the beefier consoles earlier in the year, but good god, does it look like the kind of game that would swallow up <em>all</em> of my time.</p>
<p>A knight sim RPG where you have to actually practice skills to get good at them? It might be one of the most attention-intensive gaming experiences out there at the moment, so just imagine it on the go. Hey, the first one worked well enough on Switch! <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Lumines Arise</h2>

<p>Oh man, I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lumines_remastered">Lumines</a> so much. If I’m out and about and I have my Vita or Switch on me, but I can’t think of anything to play, then I’ll often default to Lumines. It’s just such an immediately satisfying experience and you can make runs last for bloomin’ ages if you’re good enough.</p>
<p>With the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_effect_connected">Tetris Effect</a> creating this latest entry, I’ve got high hopes that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a> will be an absolute banger. Frankly, it belongs on the Switch, but you can bet that until that day comes, I’ll be rinsing it on the PS5. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>

<p>Free-to-play hero shooters are a dime a dozen these days, but it takes something special to last more than a couple of months. NetEase found that secret sauce with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and the only thing stopping me from playing with every waking moment, for a time, was that I wasn't near my PS5. Let me at it on the go, and those played hours will soon be racking up even more.</p>
<p>Actually, maybe it's best for me if this one <em>doesn't</em> come to Switch 2... <em>JN</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</h2>

<p>So far, it seems <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> is destined to be a PS5 and Windows exclusive. Heck, Sony even has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTGmg6uYXKc">slick new fight stick</a> lined up, which it’s clearly marketing in conjunction with the game.</p>
<p>But still, it looks <em>ridiculously</em> good… If this spells the end for <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom</strong>, then so be it. Arc System Works is a superb developer, and it’s made some truly spectacular fighting games. I need this on the Switch 2, Sony. Please. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</h2>

<p>Of all the games I've spoken about here, I think <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/mass_effect_legendary_edition">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> is one that will defo come to Switch 2, if circumstances at Bioware were better. It's just too important not to have on every system, goddamnit!</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of folk have played the trilogy already, but it has a special place regardless, it's one of the all-time greats and we need to ensure the children know of the legendary Shepard and his (or her) sexy companions. I shouldn't have mentioned the sexy companions. I'm gonna have to download it again now. Please put it on Switch 2 so I can have it in my lap. <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>

<p>Atlus and Sega have shown a lot of love for the Switch 2 already, so there’s no way <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is skipping Nintendo. And in my eyes, this is the best game Atlus has ever made.</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s a distillation of everything Atlus has ever done. There’s <strong>Persona</strong> and <strong>MegaTen</strong> aplenty here, but also a heavy dose of <strong>Etrian Odyssey</strong> and a sprinkling of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine</a>. But It’s also a refinement of the push-turn combat with a whole job system on top. Beyond all that, Metaphor actually has something to say and feels like the most poignant, relevant RPG in some time. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...</h2>

<p>I'm relatively surprised we haven't already seen <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/nier_replicant_ver_1_22474487139">NieR Replicant</a> (no, I'm not writing the full title out here) on Switch, so I'd like to think Square Enix will give Yoko Taro even more money by putting this sublime and messy predecessor on Switch 2.</p>
<p>NieR Replicant isn't always fun to play — that's kind of the point — but it is a beautifully, meticulously-crafted story with incredible characters and music. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll freak out, and you'll experience emotional gut punches unmatched in the medium. Plus you get to meet Kainé and Emil, two of the best video game characters ever. <em>AH</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>

<p>Okay, so I don’t know for sure if <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is going to be worth playing. After all, PlatinumGames' track record hasn't always been perfect and, in my opinion, it dropped the ball somewhat with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>. Regardless, the team has supported the Switch so much over the years, it feels weird to not see Ninja Gaiden 4 on Switch 2 (granted, the decision likely lies solely with Koei Tecmo, but still).</p>
<p>It doesn’t look like the most graphically-intensive game imaginable, so I reckon PlatinumGames could just about make it work on Nintendo’s latest console. Nailing the frame rate would be key, though, so I’m happy to give them all the time in the world to get it right. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>

<p>This surely has to be happening, right? <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, as much as it can feel like a chore at times, is also just one of the bonafide bangers of our time. Even just for the hunting I'm in for the long haul, never mind the epic, sprawling, and almost relentlessly emotional western saga that sits alongside all the shooting chipmunks for their lustrous pelts.</p>
<p>Stick this one on Switch 2, in a decent port, which seems like something that should be more than feasible at this point in the game's life (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-pretty-soon">there's even been rumours</a>), and we're looking at one of the great handheld experiences out there. <em>PJ</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Resident Evils 7, 8, 9</h2>

<p>Before you say anything, no, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_7_biohazard_cloud">Resident Evil 7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_village_cloud">8</a> are not on the Switch – Cloud Versions don’t count! So yes, proper native Switch 2 ports would do quite nicely, thank you very much. Given that both came out on the PS4 and Xbox One, I think the Switch 2 would be more than capable of running them adequately, but I’m not quite so confident about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming ninth entry looks quite a bit more accomplished in terms of visuals, so I think Capcom would probably need to do a bit of tinkering to get it running on the Switch 2. It’s still early days yet, though – let’s see another trailer first. Oh, and while I’m at it, let’s get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_3_-_cloud_version">3</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">4</a> remakes over too. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>

<p>Bloober Team has experienced a lot of fluctuating appraisals over the years, but it’s safe to say that its remake of Team Silent and Konami’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> was pretty exceptional. It got almost everything right, from the story to the atmosphere, and even the gameplay was pretty solid too, minus some frustrating moments of repetition.</p>
<p>So yes, take all the time you need, Bloober Team, but let’s get Silent Hill 2 running on the Switch 2, please. Add in some gyro aiming, maybe some spooky HD Rumble effects, and you’re onto a winner. <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>System Shock</h2>

<p>We recently saw the recent remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> on the Switch, but Nightdive Studio’s full-on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">remake of the first entry</a> is another beast entirely. It’s got such a cool visual design, utilising pixel art textures but with modern lighting and effects. It’s like HD-2D but… not, y’know?</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s a truly exceptional title and I’d love to see it on the Switch 2 with gyro aiming and all the other stuff Nightdive is so good at. There are rumours that it could also be giving System Shock 2 the same treatment, so yeah, let’s get that too! <em>OR</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Vanquish</h2>

<p>I will try to get <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/vanquish">Vanquish</a> on every system I can, and I'll mention it in every list they let me, because I like to watch men chain smoke.</p>
<p>I also like to play really great action games, from the best action-game-makers in the biz no less, that let me slide around in a jazzy robot suit whilst blowing ribbons out of loads of crazy big mecha enemies. It's delicious. It's also exactly the sort of game that would have had the Switch 1 spitting flames out its exhaust port. Switch 2, though? It could take it. They could even add extra stuff. Mario-branded cigarettes, anyone?PJ</p>
</div><div><h2>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</h2>

<p>I’ve watched my husband play a fair number of <strong>Yakuza / Like A Dragon</strong> games at this point, but I’ve never properly played myself, despite <em>loving</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> and enjoying the Dondoko Island aspect of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_infinite_wealth">Infinite Wealth</a>.</p>
<p>Truly, I’m waiting for an excuse, and it’s specifically for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> (or Yakuza 7… it’s complicated) to come to Switch 2. You <em>know</em> I love turn-based RPGs and a good story, and this is the LaD with both. I just want to spend a good time with my <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>-loving Yakuza, Ichiban… <em>AH</em></p>
