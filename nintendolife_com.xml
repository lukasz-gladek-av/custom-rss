<p>Atari has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_run_2089">Fatal Run 2089</a>, the upcoming racing revival for the Switch, will launch in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>The accompanying gameplay trailer gives us a fresh look at the new post-apocalyptic racer from developer MNSTR Studio, and we have to say, it's looking pretty decent so far. There's definitely a pretty heavy <strong>Mad Max</strong> vibe to the whole thing, and the brief snippets of dialogue sequences give us a good taste of the story.</p>
<p>We have to admit though, looking at the key features below, 20 levels doesn't really sound like a lot on paper. We might have to get a bit more context as to how long each one lasts and whether it's somewhat comparable to a proper race course you might see in a Mario Kart game, for example.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Hopefully we'll get a couple more good glimpses at the game ahead of its launch later this year, but we're certainly intrigued, at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 20 levels across four landscapes with branching paths, hidden shortcuts, and explosive set pieces</p>
<p>- Four larger-than-life boss fights that will each provide a unique challenge to players</p>
<p>- Classic arcade progression challenges you to beat the clock, or ARC decay, or it’s back to the start</p>
<p>- 63 different enhancements that can be dropped or appear in shops and 27 randomized add variety and unpredictability to each run</p>
<p>- 4 co-pilots with different skills and personalities add extra character to your adventure and ways to shape your playstyle</p>
<p>- Tailor your approach to one of seven vehicles with distinct performance characteristics: weave in and out of danger with a light ride or barrel through enemies with a heavy one. But you can only choose one car per run, no mid-trip switching.</p>
