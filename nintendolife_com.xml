<p>Now that's a Hot Shot</p>

<p>Version 1.9.8 <a href="https://claphanz.com/en/news/nintendo_switch_easy_come_easy_golf_ver198_update.html">arrived earlier today</a> and includes a caddy's worth of improvements for load times, grid display, and 1080p support for the larger Switch 2 screen.</p>
<p>Plus the game, which ran at 30fps on the original Switch back when we reviewed it in 2022, will now let you choos between a 30 and 60fps mode.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hnwxvk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The timing of this update is a little curious, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>, a brand new game in the Everybody's Golf series, comes out on Switch on 5th September (4th in Japan). We've even got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/everybodys-golf-hot-shots">a review up for that today</a>. Is Clap Hanz taking a Hot Shot at Hot Shots...? (Please don't give us a Double Bogie).</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the patch notes straight from Clap Hanz's website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ver. 1.9.8 of "Easy Come Easy Golf" was released.<br>
The content of the latest update is listed below.<br>
- Improved load times<br>
- Improved grid display<br>
- Reorganized home screen menu into a single page<br>
- Adjusted Triple Tap spin input<br>
- Improved Triple Tap gauge UI<br>
- Frame rate selection (30fps/60fps)<br>
You can also play at 60fps on Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you fancy a shot at Easy Come Easy Golf, then we rather enjoyed it back when it released on Switch, scoring it an 8/10. Now with smoother performance and an updated resolution for Switch 2, there's no better time to try it.</p>

<p>According to the eShop</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Did you know that Yuzo Koshiro, legendary video game composer, has made a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis shmup? It was released on Steam back in July, with our friends over at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/steamdeck/earthion">Time Extension giving it a glowing review</a>. It was due to launch on consoles, including Switch, at the same time, but <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/the-console-versions-of-yuzo-koshiros-earthion-have-been-delayed">was pushed back to "mid-September"</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> will be landing that mid-September date, as the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/earthion-switch/">eShop page</a> says the game is coming out on 18th September 2025. That's just over two weeks away!</p>
<p>Published by Limited Run Games and developed by Koshiro's company Ancient, Earthion is a gorgeous-looking shoot 'em up developed <em>for</em> the classic Sega console. That version is coming in 2026, but for anyone wanting it on modern consoles, you won't have long to wait.</p>
<p>Like many of the best shmups, the Earthion keeps things simple, giving your ship a main weapon and two sub-weapons and eight diverse stages to blast your way through.</p>

<p>We'll point you towards Time Extension's review for the low-down, but if you're not sold on Makoto "Karu_gamo" Wada (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gotta_protectors_cart_of_darkness">Gotta Protectors: Cart Of Darkness</a>) and Koshiro's yet, here's a little snippet from that review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Earthion is everything I'd hoped it would be when Yuzo Koshiro first announced it; a challenging shmup which pushes Sega's 16-bit hardware to its limits in terms of visuals and audio whilst combining a high level of polish with tight gameplay and plenty of longevity."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well now, that sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Let's hope that the 18th September date sticks — we've had no word from the publisher or developer on it yet, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Earthion in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>It's getting Hutt in here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are just one day away from the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> on Switch 2, and while we at Nintendo Life are still hard at work in the Jedi Temple, getting our review in order, we do have some gameplay footage for you to feast your eyes on in the meantime.</p>
<p>In the above video, you'll find 16 minutes of Outlaws on Switch 2. We've got gameplay from a whole bunch of scenarios, including internal environments, stealth sections, open-world exploring and outer space dogfights, so you can get an idea of what Nintendo's latest hybrid has in store.</p>
<p>The good news is, it looks really rather solid. We felt a disturbance in the Force when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-force-isnt-strong-with-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-initial-impressions-suggest">initial impressions</a> on the game's performance began to appear out of PAX West, but from what we've seen with our own eyes far, it plays far better than expected — heck, it looks like a totally different game to the low-frame footage Ubisoft shared in official trailers. Sure, it's a step down from the PS5 version as far as visuals are concerned, but it's nothing like as choppy as we were braced for.</p>
<p>Everything that you'll see above is from docked play, but video producer extraordinaire Alex Olney has also had a chance to play about in handheld mode, and it sounds equally promising. "It's soft, but it's perfectly playable," he said. "Frame rate is stable enough, leagues ahead of what the official trailer showed, which is a blessed relief".</p>
<p>As we mentioned, you'll have to wait a little while longer before you can read our full review for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2, but we'll endeavour to have it with you as soon as possible.</p>
