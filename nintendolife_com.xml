<p>This one is an absolutely <em>huge</em> album, featuring a whopping <strong>296 tracks</strong> with a total runtime of 6 hours and 30 minutes. Nintendo also notes how this includes music from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, to listen to the music on this app, you'll need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online membership.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Super Mario Party Jamboree got a major update in July for the Switch 2, adding Jamboree TV. This includes new minigames supporting the camera, Joy-Con mouse controls and more.

<p>Just in time for the Switch 2 release</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is on its way to the Switch 2 this December, and ahead of the big release, Ubisoft has announced a new collab with the popular manga and anime series Attack on Titan.</p>
<p>The <strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows x Attack on Titan</strong> event officially gets underway on 25th November 2025 and runs until 22nd December 2025, so it will still be live when the Switch 2 version is released. Here are the details via Ubisoft's official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a kidnapped Titan-Shifter as their weapon, a mysterious, power-hungry faction has infiltrated feudal Japan, setting their sights on total domination.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But when an attempt to rescue the Shifter fails, the lone survivor (with a dark secret) recruits Naoe and Yasuke to help her stop the group from unleashing the terror of a Titan on Japan.</p>
<p>The quest giver is in the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower (the icon is displayed on the map). Note that the quest will not be within the objective board until the player interacts with the quest giver.</p>
<p><em><strong>Unlock conditions: Unlock Yasuke as a playable character.</strong></em></p>
<p>During the quest, players can find customization for their hideout (banners and a statue) and upon quest completion, players will earn a crystal katana for Naoe.</p>
<p>Alongside the story quest, there will also be an Attack on Titan Dual Pack. Inspired by the Attack on Titan universe, this pack will include outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount. Available from the in-game store starting November 25th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ubisoft has also announced its free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brawlhalla">Brawlhalla</a> will be getting an Attack on Titan crossover on 3rd December 2025.</p>

<p>It once again highlights the title's 'T' for "Teen" rating, as the game features "animated blood and violence". Here's the official rundown. This same rating was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">originally spotted on Nintendo's US website</a> in September. Here's the summary in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is rated T for Teen by the ESRB with Animated Blood and Violence. Also includes In-Game Purchases. This is a first-person adventure game in which players assume the role of a space bounty hunter who must find a way home. Players explore a planet to uncover its mystery while engaging in combat against alien creatures and space pirates. Players use power beams, missiles, and elemental attacks to battle enemies in frenetic combat. Combat is highlighted by blaster effects, frequent explosions, and screen-shaking effects. A handful of alien creatures and boss characters emit blue/green blood when shot."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">previously mentioned</a>, this age rating is consistent with the main <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> games before the fourth entry. And once again, here's ESRB's basic summary of this particular age rating, describing what a game under this classification may contain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Teen - content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"In-game Purchases" are also specifically mentioned for the original Switch version of the game, which appears to be for the game's Upgrade Pack.</p>
<p>In other Metroid Prime 4 news, Nintendo has also recently revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/icymi-metroid-prime-4-beyond-estimated-switch-2-and-switch-file-size-revealed">eShop file sizes of the game</a> on the Switch 2 and Switch. A demo for the game has also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-demo-now-available-at-switch-2-kiosks-us">spotted at Switch 2 kiosks</a> over the past week.
