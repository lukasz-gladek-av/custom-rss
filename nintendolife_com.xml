<p>At the very end of this video, Nintendo explains the two purchase options, which is similar to various other Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>You can either purchase the Switch 2 Edition of the game, which contains the base game and expansion content, or if you're an existing owner, you'll have the option to purchase the upgrade pack for $19.99.</p>

<p>The Big Apple brawler enters the ring</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>'s roster has continued to grow, and as we enter 2026, Capcom is now looking towards the return of Alex.</p>
<p>We saw him in action in a teaser trailer earlier this month, and now this week Capcom has rolled out a first-look at gameplay of the "Big Apple brawler".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No use holding back when faced with the Dark Devil himself, as he'll show you no mercy with his array of devastatingly powerful throws!</p>
<p>Alex can be purchased individually with Fighter Coins and the owners of the Year 3 Character Pass / Ultimate Pass will automatically get access to Alex when he releases.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above, Alex is available as pass of the Season 3 Character Pass DLC, or you can purchase him separately with Fighter Coins. Capcom also offers in-game rentals, where you can try out a character for one hour before you decide whether or not to purchase them.</p>
<p>This character steps into the ring on <strong>17th March 2026</strong> and is joined by the already available characters Sagat and C.Viper, with Ingrid up next.</p>
