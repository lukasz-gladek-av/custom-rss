<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section></header><section><p>A couple of months ago, Sega released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> for the Switch 1, bringing a generally solid kart racer that gave Mario Kart a run for its money. Yet, what held it back from greatness was the overall poor performance, whether you played it on Switch 1 or via backwards compatibility on Switch 2, with each system having its own visual quirks that led to a generally subpar experience. Fortunately, Sega has now put out a native <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> that comfortably fixes the graphical and performance problems.</p>
<p>So, what exactly does the new version bring? Along with a slew of post-launch balance adjustments, some new Gadgets, and an online ranking leaderboard for the truly elite players, the headlining new feature is improved performance across the board: 1440p resolution docked and 1080p resolution portable, with a smooth 60fps for either mode when playing single player or two-player split-screen. This all comes in addition to the mix of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-gets-another-free-guest-character-today">free</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-spongebob-squarepants-dlc-now-available">paid updates</a> that have been steadily releasing, adding new characters like SpongeBob and Joker to the lineup.</p>

<p>As you’d expect, the resolution and frame bumps make this feel like a new game in certain respects, as the whimsical art style and madcap action now pop in a way that the choppy frame rate and blurry resolution couldn’t do justice. Sega clearly did more than just a simple up-res job, too. I noticed many textures have been replaced with more detailed variants and there are more environmental details like foliage that help to liven up the area around the main road.</p>
<p>With this version, I’d honestly say that Nintendo has a competitor on Switch 2 that is at the very least equal to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> if not better in certain respects. Though there’s no half-baked open-world mode to really drive home the comparison, the tight mechanics, smartly designed tracks, and a wealth of content all come together to make for a pretty compelling alternative, even if there’s a certain classic quality to Nintendo’s evergreen kart racer that’s hard for any other company to emulate. And also, it’s <em>really</em> weird that SpongeBob and Patrick don’t have any voices.</p>
<p>All told, I’d say that this version is certainly worth the punt if you’re invested in playing this on Nintendo platforms - the Switch 2 Edition fixes the issues that were holding this game back from being truly great. Unfortunately, owners of just the Nintendo Switch won’t benefit from these optimisation improvements, but if you already own this game and have a Switch 2, the $10 upgrade feels like a reasonable price to pay for such a notable leap over the old version. I’d suggest picking this up, if only to experience what a great kart racer <em>not</em> made by Nintendo can be like.</p></section></article><div><p>Mitch has been a fan of Nintendo ever since he got his start on the GBA in 2005.

<figure data-uuid="2e02f1b572090"><a title="Jaws LRG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e02f1b572090/jaws-lrg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Limited Run Games has announced a <em>very exciting</em> enhanced version of 1987's NES "classic", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/jaws">Jaws</a> - and they've got their signature offering of flashy physical editions ready to devour and everything.</p>
<p>These new physical editions of the game come complete with the 8-bit original, now with modern conveniences such as quick save. But, of course, the star turn is a "massively expanded" Jaws Enhanced Edition that embiggens the adventure to incorporate aspects from four (!) of the Jaws movies, rather than just the good one.</p>
<p>With pre-orders opening on 19th December and ending on 18th January 2026 over on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/jaws-retro-edition-bigger-boat-edition-switch-ps5?variant=44839204585525">official Limited Run Games site</a>, the game is set to be released as part of celebrations "culminating in the 50th anniversary of the blockbuster Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg film, and this time there’s no escape." We'll see about that, chief. We'll also update you folks with a solid release date when we have one.</p>

<p>Originally published by LJN back in 1987, you commandeer a boat (don't worry, it's plenty big enough) in order to hunt down a selection of nasty sea-dwelling enemies, including, of course, that great big rubber shark that terrified audiences so badly back in the days when this writer was still rocking a shark-repellent nappy (bet Batman doesn't have one of those).</p>
<p>Here are some more details on both physical versions that will be up for pre-order, alongside some screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jaws Retro Edition Features:<br></strong>Save Anywhere<br>
Rewind<br>
Achievements/Trophies<br>
Music Player<br>
Gallery</p>
<p><strong>Jaws Enhanced Version Features:</strong><br>
Massively expanded, multi-chapter adventure filled with nods and homages to all four Jaws films<br>
New quests and objectives<br>
New abilities and weapons for your boat and diver alike<br>
More challenging enemies, and more ways to deal with them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard version is $34.99, while $99.99 will get you that bigger boat with a "NES-inspired box", a CD (game) soundtrack, a shark lamp, and a couple of other bits.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the original NES game, the excellent Jeremy Parish (who happens to work at Limited Run these days) covered it in his excellent NES Works series several years ago.</p>
