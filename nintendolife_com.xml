<figure data-uuid="bcbf723b45c63"><a title="Lego Game Boy 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bcbf723b45c63/lego-game-boy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Lego Game Boy has, to be expected, proven to be a smash hit with Nintendo fans, and has no doubt been a blisteringly hot product over the Christmas period.</p>
<p>But it seems as though many folks have forgotten what a Game Boy cartridge actually looks like, as photos cropping up online showcase the Lego cartridges with the top panel placed in the centre, not offset to the left as it should be (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lego-nintendo-game-boy-set-cartridge-mistake-indent-piece-center/">Polygon</a>).</p>
<p>Look, it's an easy mistake to make, especially since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1pw67vd/even_the_gameboy_box_art_has_the_cart_wrong/">one of the official images</a> from Lego itself shows the cartridge in its incorrect state. As such, we're not going to call out anyone by linking out to a specific post online – that's just mean, y'know?</p>
<p>It's also entirely possible that those building the cartridges incorrectly might be on the younger side and perhaps have never seen a real Game Boy in the flesh. Though to be honest, we feel like those interested in this build will be older folks who want to tap into a bit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Either way, if you happen to have built the Lego Game Boy set and maybe gotten the cartridges a bit wrong, then hopefully this post will set you straight. And at the end of the day, there's really no right or wrong way to do it – it's your Lego set, so enjoy it however you like!</p>

<p>And look, before anyone points it out in the comments, yes, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/gallery-legos-new-game-boy-set-is-a-mini-masterpiece">Gallery post</a> earlier in 2025 highlighting the Lego Game Boy did include photos of the cartridges in their incorrect state. Don't worry, we'll get PJ to complete a gruelling online course to recover his Nintendo Expert credentials.</p>

<figure data-uuid="f14e8073f7421"><a title="Age of Imprisonment" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f14e8073f7421/age-of-imprisonment.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, it seemed almost inevitable that we'd see a new <strong>Hyrule Warriors</strong> title. According to a new interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">4Gamer</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-and-koei-tecmo-explain-how-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-came-to-be/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the folks over at both Nintendo and Koei Tecmo thought the same thing, and so it didn't take long for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> to get the green light.</p>
<p>Nintendo veteran Eiji Aonuma seemed especially confident in Koei Tecmo's interest in the project, stating to TOTK director Hidemaro Fujibayashi that they shouldn't make the first move and instead wait for Koei Tecmo to reach out. As expected, it did so almost immediately after TOTK's release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2rikmhl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As for producer Yosuke Hayashi, it only took a weekend of playing TOTK to realise that a game set during the Imprisoning War would be worthwhile. He states that TOTK was "sending us a message" to create a new title, and so he pitched the idea to Ryoyta Matsushita who, coincidentally, had already begun to put a plan together.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from the interview with Hayashi and Matsushita from Koei Tecmo, and Eiji Aonuma from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hayashi:</strong> We all eagerly awaited the release of Tears of the Kingdom – I personally played the weekend immediately following its release. I felt like the game was sending us a message of something like “Make a Warriors game set in the time of the Imprisoning War!” After the weekend I spoke to Matsushita saying, “Let’s make it!” and we drew up a plan.</p>
<p><strong>Matsushita:</strong> In truth, I had also actually been putting a plan together before he spoke to me (laughs). I felt like the ‘seeds’ of a Warriors game were scattered all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> On the Nintendo side, during Tears of the Kingdom’s development, Fujibayashi established in detail exactly what the Imprisoning War was. And after it was finished, he said to me, “Maybe we could ask Koei Tecmo this time too?”, but I responded with “No, let’s wait to hear from Koei Tecmo first” (laughs). It was almost immediately after that that they contacted us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Age of Imprisonment turned out to be a roaring success, earning a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">9/10 in our review</a>. We said that "Lessons have been learned from both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_definitive_edition">Hyrule Warriors</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it".</p>
