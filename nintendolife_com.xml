<p>The roster will include the likes of Tubbo, Lucy Flight, and Matthew &amp; Ryan.</p>
<p>Here's what IGN has to say about the event, which is sponsored by Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Streamer Showdown will pit 24 streamers against each other in an endurance test unlike any other. The streamers will be split into six teams, so not only will they be racing for individual glory, but they’ll also have to support their teammates as they take on every Knockout Tour rally, back-to-back.</p>
<p>Surrounding the races, we’ll also have shout-casters on hand, breaking down the day’s biggest plays and bringing you all the leaderboard latest. There will be nuggets of additional Mario Kart programming too, helping you to brush up on your own karting skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the precise time that the Streamer Showdown will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 3am PST / 4am MST / 5am CST / 6am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 11am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 12pm CET / 1pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 8pm JST / 7pm AWST / 10pm AEDT</li></ul>

<figure data-uuid="ab13495c29960"><a title="Call of Duty" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab13495c29960/call-of-duty.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision, Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been a while since we heard anything about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series returning to Nintendo platforms, and now following the recent release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7"><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong></a> on <em>other</em> platforms earlier this month, there has reportedly been some signs of life.</p>
<p>According to Insider Gaming, a new job listing from Sledgehammer Games - seeking a "Senior Technical Artist" - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/">has surfaced on LinkedIn</a>, and in the 'Bonus XP' section of the application, the team notes how it would appreciate someone with "AAA mobile or Switch experience".</p><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdrxuzwp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Although Sledgehammer only provided support on the latest Call of Duty title, it has previously taken the reins for major titles such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3"><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This small discovery follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">an update earlier this year in June 2025</a>, with a report at the time suggesting Microsoft and Nintendo still had plans to announce <em>something</em> related to this series in the future.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Nintendo originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">entered a 10-year commitment</a> to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the deal becoming legally binding in 2023. This was followed by Microsoft being given the all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition in the same year.</p>
<p>According to a previous story, Sledgehammer Games is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-office/">rumoured to be releasing its next Call of Duty</a> title in 2027.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Shadows Switch 2 Port Technical Rundown Detailed By Ubisoft]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-technical-rundown-detailed-by-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>1367008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1c4b88860f604"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c4b88860f604/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is out for the Switch 2 next week, and ahead of launch, Ubisoft has published a "deep dive" on its website about the technical aspects of this port. Here's the summary:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="frame-rate">Frame Rate</h3>
<p>Firstly, in both docked and handheld modes, the frame rate will target 30 fps. The resolution was not included here.</p>
<h3 id="adapting-to-switch-2">Adapting to Switch 2</h3>
<p>As for adapting the title to Nintendo's new system, the team says it has done <em>a lot</em> of "code-level work" to optimise and adapt the game architecture. This includes "modifying game assets to streamline certain technical aspects of the quality" without compromising the overall player experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Behind the scenes, we've worked a lot to make the world run smoothly and remain visually stunning and dynamic... For example, we're using the same cloud and cloth simulation systems, but we've optimized certain elements for the ARM processor and downscaled simulation data where needed to reduce GPU load, all while preserving visual fidelity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the Switch 2 supports Ray-Traced Global Illumination, the team has opted to use its solid baked Global Illumination system (which it also uses for "low-spec PC setups and Xbox Series S versions" of games), citing "RAM memory reasons" as the main decision behind this. It apparently allows the developers to preserve the overall experience as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h3>
<p>In terms of optimisation – Level of Detail (LOD), draw distances, texture resolution and element loading were all "carefully adjusted to maintain performance without compromising the world's depth", with the environmental richness of the world still "largely intact". However, NPC counts have been reduced in highly populated areas to maintain "smooth gameplay".</p>
<h3 id="dlss">DLSS</h3>
<p>DLSS has also been utilised, resulting in a "sharper image, with more accurate colors, improved textures, and fewer visual anomalies". Performance is described as being "smoother, offering higher FPS through upscaling, better fluidity, and reduced latency".</p>
<h3 id="handheld-and-docked-experience">Handheld and Docked experience</h3>
<p>The same post goes into more detail about each mode on Switch 2 – explaining how handheld mode is GPU-limited, with adjustments to image quality, draw distance and LOD settings to prioritise performance. And in docked, players can expect HDR support. VRR is also leveraged in handheld, offering "smoother gameplay".</p>
<p>One feat, in particular, is how "the lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 fps, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 fps on Switch 2" and the team "didn't want to compromise on that aspect" so it built a "dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 fps" to ensure the experience remains as "fluid and responsive as possible".</p>
<h3 id="switch-2-specific-features">Switch 2-specific features</h3>
<p>Last but not least are some Switch 2-specific features including touch screen navigation for menus and maps. Nintendo players can also expect this version to include "all post-launch content" excluding the "Claws of Awaji expansion" due out in 2026. Cross-progression is supported as well via Ubisoft Connect, so you can continue your adventure across platforms.</p>

<p>Nintendo continues to promote its latest game releases with new events in its mobile runner <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and next up is a collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p>
<p>This event is already underway and like previous events, you'll be able to unlock themed statues. For this particular one, this includes statues for Bee Mario, Rosalina and Balloon Yoshi. During this event, one course will be open a day for free.</p>
<p>Here's a look at each of these statues, with the event scheduled to run from now until <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2992fd063fde2"><a title="Super Mario Run" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2992fd063fde2/super-mario-run.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows previous Super Mario Run events for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brother Ship</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo released Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 on the Switch last month. If you haven't already played it, we can confirm it's still out of this world, even if the entire package comes at a high price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There’s no question about it: Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the most sublime games ever created. With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages...These games command a high price on Switch, to be sure, but you’ll be playing them for the rest of your life."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
