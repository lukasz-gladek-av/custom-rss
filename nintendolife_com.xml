<p>Last weekend, Nintendo aired a special Direct presentation for its upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a>, which is due out in cinemas this April.</p>
<p>This particular clip focused on Mario's pal Yoshi, who will join the crew in this new adventure, which takes place across all sorts of familiar locations. To celebrate this big reveal, Nintendo and Illumination have now released a new promotional poster, and it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, here's a look. As you can see, it shows Mario actually riding Yoshi:</p>
<figure data-uuid="8c1b96029652a"><a title="The Super Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c1b96029652a/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-a-new-movie-poster">promotional poster released in November</a> last year featuring Mario and Luigi in what appeared to be the Sand Kingdom from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. This looks to be the same location in the new trailer where Yoshi is discovered.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen the new trailer, be sure to check it out in our previous post. This latest update from Nintendo and Illumination also notes how the movie's release date has shifted "in the US and many additional markets globally" and is now releasing at the very beginning of April.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what could be on the way to the Switch Online's GameCube library in the future, you might want to read on...</p>
<p>What appears to be official promotional material for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack 'Nintendo Classics' library has been discovered on Walmart's website. Alongside multiple existing releases, there are two GameCube games featured that haven't even been announced for the service.</p>
<p>This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_2">Pikmin 2</a>, which were both locally released on the GameCube in 2004. Here's our own screen capture of this advertising material from the Walmart webpage. You can see Metroid Prime 2 towards the right corner of the top row, and Pikmin 2 is in the middle of the second row.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">accidentally leaked upcoming NSO games</a> in the past, so it wouldn't necessarily be a surprise if this latest discovery led to the eventual release of these titles on Switch 2's GameCube service. Of course, there's always a chance this could be some sort of blunder on Walmart's end.</p>
<p>There are currently eight titles available for the Switch 2's GameCube library, with three others confirmed to be on the way. These upcoming releases include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_xd_gale_of_darkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>.</p>

<p>Well, the day is now here, and Version 1.3.0 has officially gone live on the Switch 2. To start with, GameShare is now supported - so you can play with a friend without a copy of the game. Along with this is a long list of balance adjustments to the riders and machines. And to add this there's a whole stack of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Just be mindful that replays from the previous updates are not compatible with the latest game data. You can see the official patch notes from Nintendo's support page below:</p>
