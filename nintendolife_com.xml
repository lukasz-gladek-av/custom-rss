<p>Say hello to 'Nintendo Fukuoka'</p>

<p>Further details are scarce at the moment, but Nintendo says the store will be located in JR Hakata City (Amu Plaza), a large shopping mall consisting of clothing stores, furnishing retailers, restaurants, and more.</p>
<p>Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital of the Fukuoka prefecture. It's located within the Kyushu island of Japan, meaning it's significantly separate from the main industry island of Honshu, home to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, and Hiroshima.</p>

<p>The upcoming Nintendo Fukuoka store will join existing branches in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, the latter of which opened in October 2023. Meanwhile, joining Nintendo New York in America is the new San Francisco branch, which recently opened on 15th May 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America President and COO Doug Bowser led the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and the store offers customers the opportunity to customise their Switch Joy-Con colours. Miniature replicas of the store's character statues are also available.</p>

<p>Achievements for Switch and much more</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Argonaut Games has announced its Croc remaster is getting a major update. It's officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc Legend of the Gobbos Platinum Edition</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This free update will be applied to the console versions of the game (including Switch) on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> and promises to deliver the "best possible Croc gaming experience".</p>
<p>The 'Platinum Edition' of the game will include a new Time Attack mode, 25+ additions to the Crocipedia, the ability to swap between Croc Main Theme mixes in the main menu, bug fixes, and a bunch of quality-of-life features and improvements.</p>
<p>The team also explains how the name change is tied to PlayStation's Trophies. This update adds a new trophy set and will also bring these same achievements to the Switch with its own "in-game Achievement tracking screen".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So why the new name? Great question! When we initially launched the <em>Croc Legend of the Gobbos</em> remaster<em>,</em> we didn’t include enough trophies to qualify for the Platinum trophy on PlayStation. And it’s not permitted to simply fix this with a patch. So we had to come up with a smarter solution: release a new version of the game with a comprehensive trophy set, including 16 new Trophies and the highly coveted Platinum Trophy."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get ready, trainers</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The end of this month officially marks the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> on mobile devices.</p>
<p>This title has been regularly updated with new expansions and features like trading, and soon it will receive even more "new and updated" features in the form of three major updates "coming soon".</p>
<p>There's the new share feature, the tradable cards list is being expanded, and there'll be improvements to the wonder pick feature. Here's some PR about each feature, and you can see it all in action in the trailer above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation of the new share feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>A feature that lets you give ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity cards to friends.</li>
<li>You can send one card to each of your friends each day.</li>
<li>Once friends send you cards through the share feature, you can select and receive one card each day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Range of tradable cards expanded</strong>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to trade cards from even the most recent booster packs.</li>
<li>In addition to cards of ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity and ⭐︎1 rarities, ⭐︎2 and Shiny 1–Shiny 2 rarity cards will also be eligible for trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improvements to the wonder pick feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cards from the latest expansion that you have not obtained will appear more often.</li>
<li>The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in wonder pick.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The team says it's working hard to bring these updates to players "in the best possible way" and continues to listen to player feedback while developing and maintaining the title. The Mega Evolution expansion will also kick off at the end of October.</p>
