Ah yes, another dose of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>!</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has kicked off the year in relatively calm fashion, but before the mad Spring rush hits us, let's look at some eShop gems that are worth checking out. Yes, there are games other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizon</a> out there, we promise.</p>
<p>Here's how this works: same as ever, our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from January 2026 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gtowiz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>It's been a surprisingly busy January in terms of news and releases — Animal Crossing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII</a>, two whole Directs on the <strong>Super</strong> <strong>Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> — but the eShop exclusives have been a little on the quieter side on the review front.</p>
<p>We do have a review-in-progress for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>, but there have been plenty of other games we just haven't managed to get around to: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/they-are-billions">They are Billions</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suika-game-planet">Suika Game Planet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/citadelum">Citadelum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a>... these are just a few, too!</p>
<p>Still, we have four games that made the cut this time around, all scoring 7/10 and above. That leaves one honourable mention, and then the top three:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/cassette-boy">7/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">3rd Place - GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>The Switch 2's more-powerful hardware has really opened the door for all types of sports and racing games to make the jump onto Nintendo's console, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> has pulled up at the starting line to help get the driving going.</p>
<p>January has been a pretty impressive month for technical ports, and GRID Legends is among the very best. 60fps is the way to go here, but there are multiple different graphics settings you can play around with in both handheld and docked. That's still a rarity on Switch 2 right now, and we hope GRID sets the standard for other developers.</p>
<p>Put all of that together, along with top-notch racing mechanics, and you've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">an excellent 8/10 racer</a> on your hands. Just maybe pull out the GameCube controller for this one.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:196273 @ 1769958004 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">2nd Place - MIO: Memories in Orbit (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of great-looking games on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a> is already one of the most-stunning on the console, with a beautiful spaceship-like vessel adorned in pastels and scribbles and an eerie, ethereal atmosphere that helps carry you along the adventure.</p>
<p>The platforming in this Metroidvania can be tough-as-nails, but when you master the movement in this game, it's sublime. The combat doesn't always work for us, but everything else elevates MIO from being 'just another action platformer' into a beautiful one that will stick with us.</p>
<p>MIO is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">our second 8/10</a> in this top three, <em>just</em> beating out GRID in the votes game by one. Turns out a robot in space is faster than a car.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Dispatch (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>If you've been paying attention to gaming news and releases, then you probably saw this one coming — AdHoc's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> was the runaway winner this month, and with good reason: it's fantastic, and a true return-to-form for the Telltale-style of gameplay.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, as former Telltale devs worked on this superhero comedy caper, that goes everywhere from rude jokes to explicit moments, but even has plenty of touching scenes and a little bit of romance. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">censorship drama</a> might be sucking the air out of things at the moment, but take it from us — regardless of where you play Dispatch, you'll have a great time.</p>
<p>As both the victor and the highest-scoring game of the bunch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">with a 9/10</a>, Dispatch takes the top spot on the podium. Congrats, Robert Robertson and everyone at the Superhero Dispatch Network!</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-december-2025"><strong>&lt; Nintendo eShop Selects - December 2025</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-january-2026]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="cc13a4900cb14"><a title="Red Alarm - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc13a4900cb14/red-alarm-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Howdy, Virtual Boy fans! Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Last time</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>, and it was a pretty close-run contest. The classic SMW2 art came out on top in the end, though, with North America taking 59% of the vote, leaving the pretty Japanese variant with 41%.</p>
<p>This week, to mark the announcement of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">Virtual Boy's Nintendo Switch Online launch line-up</a>, we're taking a look at one of the titles that you'll be able to play from 17th February: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>. This <strong>Star Fox</strong>-style space shooter joins the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> on the service right from the jump, so it seems only right that we all become acquainted with its box art ahead of time.</p>
<p>Being a Virtual Boy title, there's obviously no European cover to look at this week, but the North American and Japanese designs make for a neat head-to-head. So, let's get into it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:3793,196709 @ 1769957455 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b139dcf8dc29"><a title="Red Alarm - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b139dcf8dc29/red-alarm-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American box art is just about as bright and colourful as they come. It's packed full of action with ships, explosions, a trench run backdrop vaguely reminiscent of the Death Star, and one of those green-outline maps that you only ever find in spy thrillers. Sure, it couldn't look less like the actual game, but it does a good job of selling the experience</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a58c1fe1dc9df"><a title="Red Alarm - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a58c1fe1dc9df/red-alarm-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">T&amp;E Soft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ooooh, the Japanese design goes full <strong>Top Gun</strong>. This is less about action and more about looking cool (something that's not so simple with a Virtual Boy headset strapped to your noggin). Be it the muted colour palette of blacks and reds — a more realistic image of the vibrancy you'll see in game — or the badass ship reflection in the central pilot's visor, this cover oozes cool.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting!

<p>Fancy a plant?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a whole new take on the world of Pokémon, where you'll be able to farm, grow veggies, collect resources, build things, decorate, and of course, make friends with many different Pokémon.</p>
<p>With the game scheduled to arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, more pre-order bonuses are now beginning to surface online. As highlighted by Serebii.net, the latest one is available on Amazon in the US and Best Buy in Canada.</p>
<p>If you order the game from either of these places before the release date, you'll get a download code for a 'Flat Leaf Plant' item, which can be used to decorate spaces in the game. The same bonus has been previously made available on the Amazon store in Japan.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0fefb8d8c9db2"><a title="Pokémon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fefb8d8c9db2/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Serebii.net / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not planning on getting Pokémon Pokopia from these stores, you'll apparently still be able to get this plant through regular gameplay. So no trainer should miss out!</p>
<p>Once again, Pokémon Pokopia launches exclusively for the Switch 2 this March. You can see what other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-pre-order-pokemon-pokopia-for-nintendo-switch-2">pre-order offers and bonuses</a> there are in our guide here on Nintendo Life, and find out more about the game in our previous coverage.</p>
