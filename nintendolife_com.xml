<figure><a title="Breakout Beyond - TATE Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aa9e31a4581e/breakout-beyond-tate-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Atari and developer Choice Provisions have provided a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/breakout_beyond">Breakout Beyond</a> on Switch. It's good news for those who weren't keen on the new landscape orientations – you can now play in TATE Mode!</p>
<p>With the new update applied, all you need to do is head into the options, navigate to 'Layout' and change the playfield to 'Veritcal'. Et voilà! You can now play the game vertically, just like the original arcade classic.</p>

<p>It's pretty funny to us that the update has been applied to all platforms. If you've got a monitor that can easily be turned to a vertical orientation, sure, but we can't imagine folks paying on a giant LG TV having much luck on the likes of the PS4. Still, options and all that.</p>
<p>However you choose to play, Breakout Beyond is a cracking new entry in the long-running series. We gave it an 8/10 in our review and said "Whether you’re an old-school fan or a newcomer, Breakout Beyond may be the best way to experience Atari's stone-cold classic".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067muynjp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<figure><a title="Game-Key Card Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6c91250da4f4/game-key-card-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today published the transcript of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a>, in which company president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked to comment on the Switch 2's Game-Key Card releases. Unsurprisingly, he came to the defence of the format. Equally unsurprisingly, we're still not convinced.</p>
<p>As highlighted on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lsxagrh4tp2j">@oatmealdome</a>, the topic arose from one shareholder's announcement to the Nintendo directors that they have concerns about the Game-Key Card format. "I've seen opinions on the internet saying that Game-Key Cards are unappealing," the investor said, "I'm concerned that if third-party titles using Game-Key Cards don't sell well, it will discourage third parties from supporting the Switch 2".</p>
<p>It's a fair comment, particularly given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">discourse around third-party Switch 2 sales</a> in recent weeks, but Furukawa dodged the issue like a pro. "We introduced the Game-Key Card because game file sizes are larger on the Switch 2 compared to the Switch 1," the company president responded, "We have various ways to distribute games on the Switch 2, and we are working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform".</p>
<p>Let's quickly break that down, shall we? The first section feels like a no-brainer, explaining the very basics of the format, but for all the beefy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fictions</a>, it turns a blind eye to the smaller titles that definitely could fit on a cart. As for the second section, it all feels very focused on the publisher side of things, doesn't it? As if to say, 'Oh, you don't want a Game-Key Card <em>or</em> an expensive cartridge? Have you considered releasing <em>digitally</em>?'</p>
<p>It has been rumoured for a good few months now that Nintendo is <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">only</a></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">offering publishers a Game-Key Card or an expensive 64GB cart</a>. This has yet to be confirmed, and Furukawa was never going to disclose that kind of information in a meeting like this, but it might have been nice to get a little more reassurance about what "working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform" actually entails. Hey, we can dream!</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether Game-Key Card releases actually have all that much effect on sales, but for the time being, prepare to see them sticking around on Switch 2 for a while.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> is getting another First 4 Figures statue and if you're wondering what could be next, it's the classic and iconic title screen. To be precise, it's the screen from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> Sega Genesis release.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the official description, it's got Sonic's "signature smirk and finger pointed confidently upward" towards the winged emblem and the title banner. The final product may be <em>slightly</em> different and it's "coming soon" with pre-orders opening on <strong>8th July 2025</strong>. If you sign up to F4F with your email, you can also get $10 off when pre-orders go live. Pricing hasn't been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Along with the standard release, First 4 Figures will also be offering an "exclusive edition". Each statue will come with a limited edition numbering authentication card as well. As for the dimensions it's - <strong>W 14.7" / 37.5cm, D 7.4" / 19cm, H 8.2" / 21cm</strong>, and weighs <strong>4.8KG</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the other F4F Sonic figures previously released have been based on characters like Tails, Super Shadow, Amy, Knuckles, and even Metal Sonic.</p>
<p>In some other Sonic news, Sega recently revealed a <a href="https://youtu.be/dGFfyMB_GtA">partnership with McLaren</a> to promote the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/GMBqZKttLHY">DC x Sonic JAKKs toy line</a> is also available to pre-order and another recent reveal was <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-the-sonic-superdrop">Magic: The Gathering Secret Lair x Sonic the Hedgehog</a>.</p>
