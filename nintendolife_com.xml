<p>Expectedly, it's been another big one at Nintendo Life this week. We got the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">official sale numbers</a> on the console from Nintendo, ran down a bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/11-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">games with 'secret' Switch 2 performance updates</a> you should check out, <em>and</em>, as if we weren't all full of news already, Nintendo lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">new Splatoon spin-off</a> coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>The reviews kept coming thick and fast, too, as we shared our final thoughts on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">Switch 2 itself</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">official carry case</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <em>and</em> the Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. <em>Phew</em>.</p>
<p>After all that, we couldn't possibly want to play any more Switch 2 this weekend, could we? <em>Well</em>...</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm using my crisp new system to dive into games at the cutting-edge of modern design... like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. Yes, I'm Switch 2-ing the GameCube catalogue in my downtime, but can you blame me? All those Knockout Tours take their toll on a man.</p>
<p>I'm also still fighting the urge to buy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>. I don't <em>need</em> anything else to play right now, but gosh, it sure does look good! Keep your wallet safe out there, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m very much invested in Cyberpunk 2077 at the moment; it’s a delight playing this game on the go, and I just love cruising around Night City. I never would have imagined such a graphically intensive experience with a huge open world would work so well in handheld mode, but there you go.</p>
<p>I’m also playing quite a bit of The Wind Waker and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. With the new wireless GameCube controller at hand, playing these games is like taking a time machine back to my early teenage years. Just pure bliss.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>OK, so, I haven't actually had much time to play Mario Kart World as much as I'd like to thus far, having only just managed to blast through all the cups in 100cc. So, this weekend we've got a big karting event scheduled, as I get busy smashing all of the content in free roam whilst my sons occasionally drop in to try (and fail) to best me in a race. Pair of losers.</p>
<p>Aside from this, I'm hopefully also gonna be getting into some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. I haven't played this one yet, and am hearing good things about the Switch 2 port (I don't mind 30fps in this sort of caper) so my wife and I are hopefully gonna be sitting down to some good old couch co-op. Have a nice weekend!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>The Switch 2 has more in common with the Wii U release than Switch itself. In the first couple of months on Switch I only had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a> to mess with, while on the Wii U there were plenty of third party releases that ended up being my introduction to franchises like <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> and <strong>Mass Effect</strong>. So here I am with a Switch 2, a Nintendo first-party killer app named Mario Kart World, while I am also playing catch-up with Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>.</p>
<p>But this week I also took a glimpse into the near future thanks to the ongoing STEAM Next Fest, confirming that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will most certainly end up on my GOTY 2025 list, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> is the current-gen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> game of your dreams, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323490/Truxton_Extreme/">Truxton Extreme</a> lives up to its surname, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a> will certainly see a spot on my schedule next weekend.</p>
<p>This is certainly shaping up to be one hot Summer of gaming!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>So, you've probably noticed I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart World. That's still the case — so many collectibles — but I have started a second Switch 2 game finally; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. Chapter 3 has had me howling with laughter (It's. T.V. TIME.) and I didn't realise how much I've missed Kris, Susie, and Ralsei.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm actually reviewing another game, a Switch 1 one, but you'll hear about that soon enough. Enjoy the weekend, folks!</p>

<h2>Ant Dickens, Founder</h2>
<p>In the run up to Switch 2 I was most excited about Mario Kart World, but actually it’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> that has held my attention so far, it’s simply a far better experience than on Switch. Therefore this weekend I’ll be freeing at least one Divine Beast as my little boy watches on, this his second Hyrule adventure after we played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> earlier this year. Mario Kart World will just have to wait!</p>

<p>It's now been just over a week since the Switch 2 landed and Nintendo is already wanting to know how users are finding the experience in a new survey.</p>
<p>If you happen to be located in places like Australia, New Zealand, the UK or Europe, you might have already found this email in your inbox. In it, you can expect to answer the usual details like your age, the number of people in your household, some general gaming questions, and then more specific Nintendo and Switch 2-related questions.</p>
<p>Some of the questions about the Switch 2 include if you've purchased one, if you plan to make the new console your main gaming device and how you got the system. There are even some sections requiring written replies – like why you decided to purchase a Nintendo Switch 2, what you've enjoyed about it so far, and anything about the new system you're <em>not</em> really enjoying.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f241e228e1196/nintendo-switch-2.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo, Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Nintendo, places for this survey are "limited" – so if you would like to participate, be sure to respond to your survey email "quickly" so you can <em>directly</em> share with Nintendo how your time has been with the Switch 2 after a week, or if you've even got one yet.</p>

<p>Join new and familiar friends on a magical adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hot off the heels of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a>, Koei Tecmo revealed it would be releasing another Atelier game. In case you missed it, this time it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> and it's now confirmed to be launching on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release date, a "first look" video has been released including commentary from the game's development team. Players can meet "new and familiar characters of this new magical world" and get a first glimpse at the game system and world they'll be exploring.</p>
<p>Here's the official PR and you can take a look at the developer commentary in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em></strong> takes players on a new mysterious and cosy adventure alongside new characters Rias Eidreise, an adventurer with a talent for alchemy, and Slade Clauslyter, a young man capable of opening entrances to dimensional paths leading to alternate dimensions. These two protagonists will join forces in an attempt to discover the reason for the disappearance of the inhabitants of Hallfein, while also trying to follow in the footsteps of their loved ones and restore their hometown. During their journey, they will meet various characters who will help them, including familiar faces from the Atelier series such as Sophie Nuenmuller, Razeluxe Meitzen, Totori Helmold and Wilbell Voll-Ersleid.</p>
<p>Set in the universe of <em>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator</em>, this new <em>Atelier</em> title will transport players to the continent of Lantarna, where they can explore, gather ingredients for synthesis and discover every secret corner, day or night, rain or shine. Players will also have the opportunity to explore multi-level dungeons, known as “Dimensional Paths”, where the structure will change randomly with each visit, allowing players to gather different ingredients and challenge new enemies depending on the difficulty level chosen.</p>
<p>Fights in <strong><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em></strong> will blend strategy with turn-based combat for strategic timeline command battles where players can form a team of six characters (three in the front line and three in the back). By using action points and equipped items to their advantage, users will be able to inflict damage and influence the timeline of characters’ turns, triggering consecutive turns for allies and activating powerful unite attacks.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Using ingredients gathered during exploration or combat, Rias will be able to synthesise various items during a process called “Gift Colour Synthesis”. During this synthesis process, players will have to connect the “Gift Colours” of the ingredients together to create new items. They will also be able to assign traits or change recipes depending on the ingredients used. When certain characters come to lend Rias a hand, this will further strengthen the item created.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional Atelier gameplay system alternating between exploration, combat and synthesis, users will be able to sell items via Rias’ shop while helping to develop the town. By selling synthesised items, players will earn money they can invest in the development of Hallfein, thus unlocking new recipes and progressing through the main story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you end up purchasing either a digital or physical edition of this game "up to the first two weeks after release" you can also receive the "Activewear Adventuring set" for Ria and Slade, as well as the "Adventuring Charm Set" as an early bonus.</p>
<p>There's no mention of a Nintendo Switch 2 version of this game just yet, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know. And if you haven't played Atelier Yumia yet, you can check out our Nintendo Life review:</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Banaza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6208a08d7ff13/donkey-kong-banaza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 only arrived last week, but Nintendo is already building up the hype for its next game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, or want something else from the new hardware, this new 3D Donkey Kong will be launching next month on <strong>17th July</strong>. Nintendo has issued a reminder about this via social media, which gives fans another quick glimpse at DK destroying <em>everything</em> in sight and "surfing on a rock".</p>

<p>We went hands on with Donkey Kong Bananza in April and described it as a "brilliantly bonkers" game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Donkey Kong has been living on the sidelines for a while now, Bananza truly is his time to shine, and what we got to play around with was a solid and delightfully stress-relieving bolt of silliness that we desperately need right now. We're hoping there are some more jungly levels out in the wilderness, but this could well be DK's breakout game. And he more than deserves it."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While we wait for DK to arrive, there are plenty of other first and third-party Switch 2 games to enjoy including titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

<p>So, the countdown for DK's 3D outing is officially underway. Will you be adding this one to your Switch 2 library when it arrives next month? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/96327f4900f30/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following Nintendo's news about the Switch 2 becoming the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">"fastest-selling Nintendo hardware" ever in the US</a>, we've now got some numbers to go with it, courtesy of Circana’s analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>According to Piscatella, this is an "all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US", with "over 1.1 million units sold" (week ending June 7, 2025). The previous record was held by Sony's PlayStation 4, and the sales calculated here for the Switch 2 exclude My Nintendo Store purchases.</p>
<p>Additionally, 79% of US buyers purchased the Switch 2 exclusive launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on release – either physically or as part of the system bundle.</p>
<p>On the software front, Mario Kart World is leading Switch 2 physical game sales in this same location, followed by CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in second place, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</a> in third. Unsurprisingly, the new Mario Kart has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">dominated software sales</a> on the Switch 2 in other regions in the first week.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2 had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units globally"</a> in its first four days, making it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" ever in this amount of time.</p>
