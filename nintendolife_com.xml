<figure data-uuid="a035113dba7af"><a title="Third-Party Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a035113dba7af/third-party-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has gotten off to a bit of a weird start.</p>
<p>Although there’s no denying that the console has been a massive commercial success since its launch on 5th June 2025 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">officially selling over 10 million units</a> — there’s a niggling, underlying sense of dissatisfaction amongst some fans regarding Nintendo’s first-party lineup (and let's just save Game-Key Cards for another time, hm?).</p>
<p>It’s not that difficult to see why. Disregarding ‘Switch 2 Editions’, we’ve had a total of five first-party exclusives for the system so far: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, and now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Certainly not a bad start, but I'd argue that out of these, only Bananza has received (almost) universal acclaim. Even Mario Kart World, widely regarded as Switch 2's 'killer app' before launch, has been criticised for its structure and open world.</p>
<p>And although Bananza has been praised far and wide for its satisfying, chaotic gameplay, there’s nevertheless a feeling that this isn’t <em>quite</em> what fans want in the system's first year. Donkey Kong, as beloved as he is, isn’t Mario.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c7d7b0ae6e6c7"><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7d7b0ae6e6c7/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that’s the issue, right? Although on the surface, a brand-new Mario Kart game and a 3D Donkey Kong platformer <em>should</em> be slam dunks for Nintendo, they both kind of fall short for some. Compare this to 2017 when the original Switch saw the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_2">Splatoon 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> all in the first year, and I can understand the frustration. <em>[<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, too!... - Ed.]</em></p>
<p>I, however, have not felt any of this, and it’s down to one simple reason: third-party games. I can distinctly remember those first few months after the Switch’s launch; outside of Breath of the Wild and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, I spent the majority of my time playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thumper">Thumper</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These were great games and I don’t for one moment regret my time with them, but goodness, they were pretty much my only options for a while.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, it's the polar opposite. Third-party support has been absolutely <em>phenomenal</em> right out of the gate, and I’ve already sunk hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and more. I frankly can’t keep up.</p>
<figure data-uuid="47dc14a77a03e"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47dc14a77a03e/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus / Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch got good third-party support too, of course, particularly as its sales exploded. But hardware limitations proved to be a significant barrier over time, and for years I’ve been gazing longingly at games on other platforms and thinking, <em>'Cool, but I wish this was on Switch.'</em></p>
<p>We've been dreaming of a time when third-party publishers would go above and beyond to support a Nintendo system — the dark days of the Wii U still loom in my mind — and the Switch 2 already feels like a realisation of that dream. No longer does it feel like we’ve been left behind, and we already have publishers planning launches for flagship games day-and-date with other platforms.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. For years, Capcom has leaned almost exclusively on PlayStation for its marketing, but the company appears to have shifted that focus over to Switch 2 for its upcoming release. The original Switch, as capable as it was, couldn’t handle Capcom’s more recent RE games natively, and so they were relegated to ‘Cloud Version’ status. They felt like an afterthought, with Capcom razor-focused on advertising its flagship titles on Sony's consoles - no real surprise when you consider RE started on PS1.</p>

<p>Not anymore. Now that Switch 2 can fight the other platforms' fire with fire, Capcom clearly sees enormous potential. Cue the announcement of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">special edition themed Pro Controller and a Requiem amiibo</a>, and it’s looking more and more obvious that the Switch 2 is a high priority to accelerate Capcom's growth.</p>
<p>And let’s be fair, the PlayStation audience know Resident Evil very well at this point; it seems unlikely that this shift will greatly affect Requiem’s performance on Sony's console.</p>
<p>Has every third-party effort been perfect? No. A few games, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, prove — at least at launch — that performance can still hit a few snags on Switch 2, while we've still yet to receive a firm release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> after a last-minute delay.</p>
<p>There are some teething issues, then, but by and large, I think we can expect great things from third parties. Even when the PS6 and whatever the heck Microsoft is cooking up launch, it's likely that games will remain scalable enough to run on Switch 2 without looking and performing like crap.</p>
<p>We're very much in an era of diminishing returns regarding raw power, so I feel like pretty much any game launching on Switch 2 will at least look good, if not great. And publishers who perhaps weren't as invested in the Switch certainly won't want to make the same mistake twice with the Switch 2. So if they can scale a high-end game down just enough so that it impresses visually yet still performs well, you can bet they'll be doing it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="60d1aca42bb2f"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60d1aca42bb2f/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So if you're someone who generally sticks with first-party software, I'd urge you to branch out and see what else is out there. I understand the frustration if you feel these first months have been a bit lacking. As for me? If this level of third-party support holds for the years ahead, I can honestly see Switch 2 becoming my primary console for almost <em>everything</em> bar PS5 exclusives.</p>
<p>It's just that good.</p>

<p>That newbie is, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, which has managed to snap up all three spots on the podium this week with its release on Switch, PS5 and Switch 2.

</section></header><div><section>

<p>At last, <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1986478837384028422">Sega has confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> launches on <strong>4th December 2025</strong> for <strong>$69.99</strong>, right in time for the holidays (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-launches-december-4">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>Note that a physical release, where the game is fully on the cart, will be following in early 2026.</p>
<p>Those of you who have already bought the game on Switch 1, you'll be able to purchase an upgrade pack for <strong>$10</strong> (or your regional equivalent) — <em>plus</em> if you grab that pack before 10th December, you'll get a 50% discount. $5 it is, then.</p>
<p>Those of you who'll be grabbing the game on Switch 2 before 17th December will also get the Werehog Pack DLC as a free bonus.</p>
<p>Originally launching on the Switch back in September, Sonic Racing CrossWorld has already sold over 1 million units and has been receiving frequent guest character updates. Just today, Like A Dragon's own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-gets-another-free-guest-character-today">Ichiban Kasuga has joined the roster</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-racing-crossworlds">review of the Switch 1 version</a>, penned by our very own Mitch Vogel, was full of praise for the karting and racing, but said the performance on the older console was "disappointing". The Switch 2 version <em>should</em> fix those issues, then...</p>

<p>We last caught wind of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> back in July, when developer Feral Interactive announced that it was bringing its latest remake to Switch at some point in 2025, with a Switch 2 edition to follow. Things have remained quiet on the Switch 2 front, but today, we've had news of the Switch 1 version, and it's arriving <em>next week</em>.</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly. Hitman: Absolution will land on Switch 1 on <strong>13th November</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $29.99 / €24,99</strong>. The new trailer (above) showcases the 2012 stealth game in action on Nintendo's hybrid, and it looks, well, much as we remember it. But hey, more Hitman is never a bad thing!</p>
<p>Like Feral's recent mobile release, Absolution on Switch will be getting a 'Contracts Mode' update next year, where you'll be able to set challenges against friends and compete for high scores.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens from Feral Interactive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MORE THAN A NUMBER<br></strong>The story of Absolution puts Agent 47’s character under the spotlight, where his loyalties and his conscience are both put to the test.<br>
<strong>TAILORED TO NINTENDO SWITCH<br></strong>Featuring gyro aiming for ultimate precision, Absolution is fully optimised for Nintendo Switch and tailored for play at home or on the go.<br>
<strong>KILLER INSTINCT<br></strong>Use Instinct Mode to identify targets, predict enemy movements, and highlight points of interest.<br>
<strong>CLEAR YOUR PATH<br></strong>Point Shooting lets you stop time, mark multiple enemies, and eliminate them in a heartbeat.<br>
<strong>MASTER THE CRAFT<br></strong>Find new ways to take out your marks, complete Challenges, and perfect your technique.<br>
<strong>PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN<br></strong>Choose from 5 different difficulty settings, from easy to the insanely hard Purist mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"But what about the Switch 2 version?" you may, rightfully, ask. Well, we still don't know yet. Feral stated on <a href="https://x.com/feralgames/status/1986459928525938858">Twitter</a> that it will "have more to say about the Switch 2 next year," and fans should "keep an eye out for further announcements". So, we guess we'll do exactly that!</p>
<p>As a reminder, IO Interactive brought Hitman World of Assassination to Switch 2 earlier this year, though a wealth of performance issues meant that it wasn't in the best state at launch. A subsequent patch helped things move in the right direction, but let's hope that Feral Interactive can make Absolution stronger out of the gate.</p>

<figure data-uuid="7751340a518eb"><a title="A Link to the Past" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7751340a518eb/a-link-to-the-past.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Analytics firm <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/">Ampere Analysis</a> has posted a list of games it believes would greatly benefit from a remake or remaster (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ip-holders-are-sitting-on-a-wealth-of-content-analytics-firm-lists-18-games-ripe-for-remake-or-remaster-success/">VGC</a>). This is supposedly based on analysis of the market and consumer behaviours and attitudes – otherwise, we could just as easily pluck a bunch of games from thin air that we think need remakes!</p>
<p>What caught our eye straight away was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, both of which are, according to Ampere, prime candidates for full remakes. Now, we'd be happy to make a case for Chrono Trigger; especially if Square Enix wants to opt for the HD-2D style it's been evolving in recent years. A Link to the Past, though? Hmm, we're not sure about that.</p>
<p>The thing is with top-down Zelda games is that, in our opinion, they kind of need to <em>stay</em> top-down. And considering the game has already received a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>, we're not entirely convinced it really needs a remake.</p>
<p>Ampere writer Katie Holt says that while long-time fans consider it a high point in the series, “its dungeon and world design can be considered outdated, and the narrative is relatively linear by today’s standards”. In addition, searching for “The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past remake” on Reddit returns an astonishing 48,200 results, and Nintendo would supposedly be wise to approach it in a similar way to the Switch remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Ampere believes that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time_3d">Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> would benefit from a remake or a remaster – they're supposedly not fussed which. And yeah, we could get on board with this. With the 40th anniversary looming, we wouldn't be surprised to see Nintendo revisit what is arguably one of the most influential 3D adventure games of all time.</p>
<p>Here's the list of games from Ampere Analysis:</p>
<h3>Remake</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assassin’s Creed</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</li>
