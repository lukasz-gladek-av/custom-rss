<p>From Z-A and beyond</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Not content with <em>only</em> releasing a new mainline game and tickets to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/a-new-pokemon-pop-up-store-is-coming-to-london-next-year">upcoming pop-up store</a> in October, The Pokémon Company is bringing even more monster-catching content to the UK in the coming weeks with a new series of the <strong>Pokémon Horizons</strong> anime.</p>
<p>Part one of the third season, subtitled 'Rising Hope', will arrive on BBC iPlayer on <strong>27th October</strong>, with more episodes following in the future. Those in the US will have to wait a little longer before it makes its regional debut on Netflix on 6th January 2026.</p>
<p>Here's an official synopsis of what we can expect from this third season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been one year since the events in Laqua left the Rising Volt Tacklers without a leader and a way forward, but a mysterious pink mist that harms Pokémon spurs Liko and Roy into action! Both Trainers have gained confidence and strength alongside their Pokémon, including Roy’s newest friend, a yellow Lucario capable of Mega Evolution. They’re joined by Dot, an intel-gathering expert, and Ult, a brash young Trainer who considers Roy his rival. Determined to rebuild the Rising Volt Tacklers and fulfill a promise made in Laqua, Liko, Roy, and friends are training harder than ever as they take on the Explorers and forge a new path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all of that means nothing to you, then you can catch up on seasons one and two on iPlayer right now to work out what's going down with Liko, Roy and the gang.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> arrives before all that, with both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions launching next week on 16th October.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of the stylish pinball game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon's Tilt</a>, then we have good news. The cyberpunk-esque sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a>, is out now on the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>Once again developed by WIZNWAR and published by FLARB, Xenotilt is absolutely bursting at the seams with neon colours, nightmarish boss characters, and big numbers that go up, up, and up. In short, it's a game that will undoubtedly hook its claws in you and refuse to let go.</p>
<p>We reviewed Demon's Tilt back in 2019 and awarded it a score of 8/10, stating that it's "a game of stunning depth and complexity which rewards methodical players who aren't afraid to invest a lot of time learning all of the secrets and hidden tactics".</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features for Xenotilt:</p>
<ul>
<li>AN EXPANSIVE 3 STORY TABLE</li>
<li>NIGHTMARISH NEW BOSSES</li>
<li>REALTIME LIGHTS, GORGEOUS SPRITEWORK</li>
<li>9 BALL MULTIBALL MATRIX</li>
<li>BIG NUMBERS, BULLET HELL</li>
<li>CAVERNOUSLY DEEP MECHANICS</li>
<li>A MEGA-DRIVEN SOUNDTRACK BY EC2151</li>
</ul>

<p>Xenotilt is available now for <strong>£17.99 / $19.99</strong>. If you're on the fence for now, we'll have a review live very soon.</p>
