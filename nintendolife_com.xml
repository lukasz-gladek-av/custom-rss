It's time for this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-super-bomberman-2-snes">Last time</a>, it was a one-on-one match-up for the SNES' <strong>Super Bomberman 2</strong> to celebrate its arrival in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, and it was a pretty tight contest. The Japanese cover <em>just</em> came out on top, in the end, winning 56% of the vote and leaving the Western variant with the remaining 44%.</p>
<p>This week, with another collection on our minds, we're taking a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> for the Game Boy Color. While it was a mighty hop, skip, and jump away from its PlayStation counterpart, we have some fond memories of this 2000 platformer. You just know that we'll be diving into it all over again when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> lands on Switch this week.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6vgxnqz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There are three covers to choose between this week, so let's check 'em out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:197441,24167 @ 1771153203 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="94b458740de75"><a title="Rayman (GBC) - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/94b458740de75/rayman-gbc-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8321-rayman">Ubisoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American cover is a pretty standard Rayman affair. Our limbless hero takes centre stage, swinging through a green backdrop on a vine. It's simple and to the point, but it's difficult to knock.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6ee5fa0bc9c83"><a title="Rayman (GBC) - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ee5fa0bc9c83/rayman-gbc-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8321-rayman">Ubisoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design dares ask the question, 'What if the North American cover was... red?' The result is, well, redder.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="76c722c2c75bf"><a title="Rayman (GBC) - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/76c722c2c75bf/rayman-gbc-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8321-rayman">Ubisoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now here's something different. The singular Rayman is here replaced by a whopping <em>five Raymans</em> (Raymen?), each in a different pose. The backdrop is a little bland, by comparison, but it's always nice to see more going on.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

<p>NIS America teams up with Happinet</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch 2 is getting another strategy RPG, with NIS America this week announcing it's teamed up with Happinet to publish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/brigandine-abyss">Brigandine: Abyss</a> - a "brand-new entry" in the storied franchise.</p>
<p>It's due out at some point in <strong>2026</strong> and features a completely unique world that both new and experienced players can dive right into. Here's a bit more about it from the official PR, and you can check out the announcement trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hundreds of years ago, the Abyssloa Empire was stopped by the power of the arcane Brigandine. Now, a new Abyssloa Empire rises from the ashes, ready to conquer the world. Confront the dark as you manage resources, rally your monsters, and stand against the empire in one of six different story campaigns."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>For a more classic Brigandine experience, turn to Mission Mode, which lets you take the role of one of 24 different factions, each with their own win conditions!</p>
<p>Whether you want to challenge your tactical acumen or take it easy, you'll find hundreds of hours of fun in Brigandine: Abyss! Whether you choose to play through the story or Mission Mode, gameplay will take place over two phases. Organize your troops and resources during the Organization phase, then take to the field during the Attack Phase! Brigandine: Abyss maintains the series’ unique hexagonal-grid-based strategy gameplay and gives players plenty to think about.</p>
<p>You’ll need to consider your skills, elemental attributes, and the development of your armies if you hope to find success on the battlefield!</p>
<p><strong>Confront the Dark:</strong> The Abyssloa Empire rises again, and it's up to you to stop them. Choose from one of six different story campaigns to find out the truth - or keep it hidden.<strong><br>
Victory Is in the Details:</strong> Spreading your influence won't be easy. Manage your resources, maneuver your troops, and bind your fates with monsters to make sure you can stand up to anyone. Then, take to the field and reap the rewards!<strong><br>
Fight for Your Faction:</strong> In Mission Mode, play as one of 24 different factions, each with their own unique win condition. Play one or play them all in this endlessly replayable strategy RPG!</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Earn the number</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> was delayed recently, his new mission is now back on track with a <strong>27th May 2026</strong> release.</p>
<p>With the target date in his sights, IO Interactive has now treated fans of Bond to a new trailer. This video originally popped up during this week's PlayStation 'State of Play' broadcast and focuses on the story of this "re-imagined origin story" where Bond must "earn the number" in the 00 Programme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Discover a re-imagined origin story as James Bond enters the 00 Programme as a promising young recruit. Despite his occasional recklessness, Bond's intuition, charm, and skill will push him to #earnthenumber within His Majesty's Secret Service."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see in the action-packed trailer above, as Bond, you'll encounter plenty of friendly and not-so-friendly faces on your mission.</p>
<p>This new "thrilling espionage action-adventure game" is once again made by the developer behind the latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman</a> outing, which made its debut on the Switch 2 last June and also got a special mission featuring a 007 First Light unlock.</p>
