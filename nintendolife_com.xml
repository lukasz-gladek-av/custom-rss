Following the 1.2 patch towards the end of last month, the team has now released a few more update.</p>
<p>Below are both sets of patch notes, with PopCap noting how Patch V.1.4.0 is also "close to being done".</p>
<p>The latest updates include Nintendo-specific fixes and improvements. In v1.3.0 this includes some fixes tied to GameShare and GameChat, and the previous update v.1.2.1 includes adjustments and updates to mouse mode, and more.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kpynhs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the full rundown from EA's official website:</p>
<h3><a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-en/patch-notes-pvz-replanted-patch-v1-3-0/12873340">PVZ: Replanted: Patch v1.3.0 (3rd November 2025)</a></h3>
<p>This update goes live on 11/3 on PC with consoles to follow within a few days after.</p>
<p>Dig into the details below:</p>
<p><strong>Audio:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dynamic Audio to the level music so it no longer always plays at the highest intensity version (perfect time for a blindfolded run)</li>
<li>Minigame, Puzzle, Survival and Almanac menus now play the correct music instead of the previous menu's music</li>
<li>Sound effects no longer overlap menu music at higher game speeds</li>
<li>Added missing menu open SFX for Pause Menu</li>
<li>Collecting Sun has a wider range of audio played</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[Vs Mode] Plant and Zombie tooltips now properly appear when using controllers during match selection</li>
<li>Retro Zombies no longer unexpectedly jump or teleport ahead during movement (Dr. Zomboss got us good with this one)</li>
<li>Disabling Vsync no longer impacts Mouse cursor speed</li>
<li>Fixed plants showing incorrectly when collecting sun while dragging them to be placed with Touch inputs</li>
<li>Dr. Zomboss no longer signs his notes with a comma after his name (We wonder if Tugboat was forging those notes for him)</li>
<li>Various text string fixes</li>
<li>Cards are hidden properly after Planterns are eaten in Vasebreaker</li>
<li>Fixed various visual issues with Magnet-Shroom grabbing items</li>
<li>Fixed a few Controller prompts showing incorrectly when not using controllers for input</li>

<li><strong>SWITCH:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed GameShare via GameChat not detecting the current profile properly if it was not in the 1st profile position</li>
<li>We are aware that Switch patches have been lagging behind other platforms and taking longer than expected to release. This is due to certification timelines and we intend to release them as soon as possible.
<ul>
<li>To check your game version select the game icon in the main menu and press the plus button. The game version will be visible at the top of the screen, right under the game name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And just like every garden, there’s still some more work to be done. Patch V1.4.0 is close to being done which will add the ability to collect sun with the squeeze of a trigger on controllers and aim to get rid of some more pesky bugs among other things!</p>
<p>Expect this patch to go live within the next two weeks with more details of the next patch being shared closer to its release. So stay tuned and once again, thanks for your support, feedback, and patience! Now let’s get back on the lawn and listen to those sweet tunes!</p>

<p>Power up next week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> launches for the Switch and Switch 2 next week, and in case you missed it, players who purchase the Switch release will be able to update their game to play an "enhanced version" on the Switch 2 system.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco explains on its website (and in the video above) how you'll be able to do this by simply connecting your Switch 2 system to the internet and then downloading the update. After this, the characters and backgrounds in the game will appear with "improved clarity and richer detail".</p>
<p>When applying this update, certain save data - including battle replay data, edit data and online records cannot be carried over. As for battles, you'll be able to play with users on Switch 2 and other Switch players who have this same update applied.</p>
<p>Below is a look at the Switch version before the update, after the update, and how the game looks on Switch 2:</p>
