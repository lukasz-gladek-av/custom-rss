<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159481/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-atelier-games-on-nintendo-switch">Atelier</a> series, variety is the spice of life. One might think that more than 25 games deep into developer Gust’s long-running RPG series, the sheen of that trademark gameplay loop of collecting materials, learning recipes, and crafting items via alchemy would start to dull a little. Yet, with the introduction of each new entry and corresponding sub-series, Atelier constantly finds ways to reinvent itself and offer a unique spin on its tried-and-true gameplay systems. From the darker and more action-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a> to the sprawling adventure saga of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/atelier-ryza-secret-trilogy-deluxe-pack">Atelier Ryza</a> trilogy, each title has its own distinct identity.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a>, the 27th mainline entry in the series, is such a complicated game to explain. So much of its identity is owed to what came before it. It’s simultaneously a standalone sequel to a free-to-play gacha game, a major crossover event that incorporates characters from past entries, <em>and</em> a self-proclaimed return to the series' turn-based roots. At the same time, it’s also very much its own thing, chronicling an original story with new leads and fresh gameplay concepts.</p>

<p>A lesser game might be crushed under the weight of all the things Atelier Resleriana is supposed to be, yet it manages to dovetail each responsibility into a cohesive whole. The result is one of the stronger Atelier releases in recent years and, thankfully, an enjoyable experience that remains largely unfettered by Switch 1’s ageing hardware.</p>
<p>Set after the events of 2023’s <strong>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy &amp; the Liberator of Polar Night</strong> (a mobile and PC-based gacha title that is no longer available to play outside of Japan), this moves the focus to two new playable protagonists: Rias and Slade. They hail from Hallfein, a once-bustling town that suffered a mysterious tragedy 12 years prior and has since fallen into disrepair. When the pair of adventurers meet and stumble across an abandoned atelier, they resolve to use the power of alchemy to restore their hometown to its former glory and uncover the mystery behind its downfall.</p>

<p>In keeping with its narrative focus, Atelier Resleriana’s gameplay is defined by three key areas: exploring the world and its dungeons while collecting alchemy ingredients and battling enemies; synthesising and strengthening new items via alchemy recipes at the atelier; and improving the quality of the town by selling items at Rias’ store or taking on additional quests and side activities. Each strand is well-defined with its own set of intricacies and systems to learn, and the way all three interweave makes engaging with each one key to progression.</p>
<p>The game’s refreshed alchemy system sees you combining ingredients to produce items and equipment for your party. Materials possess two distinct colour attributes that must be chained together to effectively pass on unique traits and effects. It may seem like a simple match-the-colour system on the surface, but there are a ton of wrinkles and additional mechanics that up the complexity of crafting considerably.</p>
<p>Having a nice amount of depth in the alchemy system is an Atelier hallmark, though this iteration’s tutorials don’t always do the best job of explaining all the need-to-know ins and outs. This opaqueness can be frustrating, especially as a few battles in the mid-to-late game ramp up the challenge to test your crafting mastery.</p>

<p>You collect materials by exploring locations and progressing through a slew of floor-based dungeons with procedurally generated interiors that change upon each visit. The act of collecting materials essentially boils down to hitting a button to instantly harvest useful stuff with ease. You can gather one handful of items after another within seconds, and having a constant influx of valuable ingredients added to your basket is pure dopamine.</p>
<p>For their part, battles have returned to a turn-based format from earlier Atelier titles. Here, you control the actions of up to three party members on your frontline. Most of the genre staples are present — each character has their own stats and skillsets (which can be expanded and improved via a skill tree or levelling up), and they can use their turn to perform an element-based attack or use an item. Enemies have elemental resistances and weaknesses that can be exploited to temporarily stun them. Party members who act in succession can also follow up each other’s actions with extra attacks.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159486/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The basics of combat may be straightforward, but Atelier Resleriana also includes several key mechanics that keep battles feeling dynamic and fresh. Arguably the biggest is the presence of a visible turn timeline à la <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, which you can use to plan out your strategy multiple moves in advance, and even manipulate to change turn timings and obtain certain bonus effects. Determining when to schedule an Interruption action for a free item use or deciding which target to steal an effect from on their next projected turn adds a whole additional layer to battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Multi-Action mechanic allows you to spend accumulated Technical Points to give an active combatant and two of your non-active party members a chance to perform an action in one fell swoop before swapping out the main fighter for someone on the back line. This twist allows you to perform some pretty devastating combos while keeping all of your party members relevant and involved.</p>
<p>There are more battle mechanics to play around with besides these, but the point is that Atelier Resleriana’s combat is a nice blend between classic turn-based RPG fare and fresher concepts that encourage further strategy and optimisation.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159480/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, there’s the town improvement system, which centres around management of Rias’ shop, Mistletoe Miscellaneous. Here, you can stock items you’ve synthesised, hire fairies as staff, and customise the interior to your liking. As the shop sells wares, you can both turn a profit and level up various parts of Hallfein.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to improve the town by taking on optional side quests and partaking in other activities around town. Certain shops, items, and visitor characters become available as Hallfein grows, but seeing the struggling locale’s condition visibly improve over the course of the game offers a rewarding sense of progression in itself.</p>
<p>On that note, I quite enjoyed the restrained and laid-back nature of the story. While it’s not without its high-stakes moments and occasional twists to keep things interesting, Rias and Slade’s journey feels refreshingly quaint with a greater emphasis on character dynamics. It helps that the main cast is made up of supremely likeable and charming people who come alive thanks to fluid animation work and fully-voiced cutscenes.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159483/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The people you meet are compassionate and willing to lend a helping hand far more often than not, and it’s easy to root for the team as they rally behind Hallfein’s restoration. It may not be everyone’s tonal cup of tea, but the whole thing just comes off as very pleasant and earnestly sweet without falling into saccharine territory.</p>
<p>You'll spend a whole lot of time with these characters, too, with an ample amount of cutscenes both throughout the main story and within optional character episodes and side quests. These story segments are generally enjoyable for the reasons described above, although there really are a ton of them, and they can be rather long-winded at times.</p>
<p>Cutscenes are also easy to trigger, even when you don’t intend to. Going to a certain area or speaking to a certain character can cause multiple cutscenes to stack, automatically playing out one after another and bringing progress to a screeching halt. Suffice to say, there are plenty of spans when all you can do is set down the controller and watch things play out.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159488/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that both the main story and side content feature a bunch of returning characters from Atelier history who make up most of the primary and supporting cast, including the bulk of your party members. Thankfully, the game doesn’t let this crossover element overpower the core narrative and effectively introduces everyone without much confusion. That said, you’ll definitely get much more out of all the little nods and references embedded in the story if you’re familiar with previous entries.</p>
<p>You'll also be relieved to hear that Atelier Resleriana appears on Switch without egregious performance concessions. The game ran at what appeared to be a rock-solid 30 frames per second throughout my playthrough, which feels fluid enough to fit its moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
<p>Visuals have definitely taken the greatest hit, as it can get pretty blurry and jaggy in handheld mode. Thankfully, the stylised art direction shines through even in the messier moments. Atelier Resleriana on Switch may not be as sharp or as smooth as it is on other platforms, but it still plays just fine and stands as a more-than-viable version.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Between a restrained scope and structure that harkens back to the Atelier games of old, a bevvy of fresh gameplay twists to call its own, and a metric ton of fanservice for veterans, Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian feels like a triumphant celebration of the entire series’ legacy.</p>
<p>More importantly, it’s just a really great RPG experience. Appropriately, it mixes together a bunch of quality ingredients — a heartwarming narrative, strategic and dynamic turn-based combat, complex crafting systems — and synthesises them into a jolly little romp of an adventure. There’s certainly a bump in the road or two, but the ride is too enjoyable to linger on those for long.</p></section>

But before we dive into what we're playing over the next couple of days, let's just look back at some of the recent news highlights.</p>
<p>The big talking point this week was undoubtedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">the debut video(s) from Nintendo Pictures</a>. While there was a lot of mystery surrounding the first release, most had assumed that it would be <strong>Pikmin</strong>-related, and this was indeed confirmed just one day later. It's a lovely release, so do check it out if you haven't already.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-three-more-titles">three SNES games have been added to Nintendo Switch Online</a> – perhaps not the most exciting line-up imaginable, but welcome nonetheless. Alarmo (remember that?) also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-alarmo-is-getting-a-kirby-themed-update">received a new Kirby-themed update</a>, which means we're <em>still</em> waiting for those sweet <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> themes – come on, Nintendo.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Since last weekend was pretty much dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, I'd like to spend a bit of time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> and actually get a decent start on it. On the other hand, I've recently jumped into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt</a>, and my goodness, it's absolutely <em>marvellous</em>. Gorgeous visuals and lots of numbers that keep going up, up, up. It's addictive stuff.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still banging my head against repeatedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> runs and, once again, it’s refusing to let me go. I don’t think I’m quite as <em>into</em> this one as I was its predecessor, but it’s still a jolly good time and a firm reminder that I am very bad at just about every boss fight going.</p>
<p>If I can put it down, I’d really like to get back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, which I haven’t touched in about a week but has really gotten under my skin. I’ll wrap it up on PS5 soon enough, I’m sure, but it has to be coming to Switch 2 soon, right?</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I've got a bunch of things to review over the weekend so most of my gaming time will be spent doing that. However, I will also be putting a little time aside especially for Hades II and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> action.</p>
<p>I genuinely can't believe these latest Galaxy 1+2 ports have been out this long and I haven't even started them yet. I'm losing my touch.</p>
<p>I never had a touch.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This week, it's nothing but Hades 2. I was a very good girl and waited until it was out of early access, a feat of willpower for which I deserve the highest praise, and I'm glad I did — although I always feel like I can sort of see the stitches in a formerly-early-access game. I can see the places where they've added more content, like building on an extension after realising that they forgot to put in bathrooms; I can feel the tension between whatever the early combat systems were, and how they ended up changing to be different from the first game, and more like what the early access players wanted. There's a lot of speedrunning and min-maxing stuff, for example. I don't hate it!</p>
<p>But I am less invested in the storyline this time, which is a shame, because Hades was so pivotal to me as a player, designer, and writer. It's like they lost their sense of humour. Supergiant has always had a really masterful way of weaving together cosmic tragedy and silliness (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bastion">Bastion</a> was great at it), but Hades 2 is far more serious. I have strong thoughts on Comedy As Serious Art, and I love when games get it right, so I'm a little disappointed, especially because I love seeing the Gods take things less seriously than mortals would. There are still moments of levity, but they're largely at the side of the Main Story. Still, I'm relatively early in the game — maybe a little under midway through the story? — so perhaps it lightens up a bit!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm reliving my Final Fantasy Tactics obsession through Zach all over again, who's playing on Tactician difficulty. So of course we're getting our backsides handed to us every so often. We're approaching <em>that</em> Chapter 3 fight, so let's see if we get another rude reawakening...</p>
<p>That's pretty much it for me right now — things are busy busy in our household right now! Enjoy your weekends, folks!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Greetings programs! I have arrived at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> point where I am told if I proceed forward, I will miss out on all unresolved side quest content. So instead of properly finishing the game, I will probably be running around the galaxy for odds and ends. Wow, it’s Lando Calrissian! While not properly a new game despite its recent début on the eShop, Söldner-x: Himmellstürmer is giving that euro-shmup bliss I often crave and it was the only game in the series I had never played before with the added bonus of a banger soundtrack by Rafael Dyll. Also making my way to the final missions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gearbits">Gearbits</a> and I've made my way to Cronos in Hades II. Hopefully a defeat of the Titan is on the cards for this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 31 of 50 games played. Wow, these week’s lot is impressive! Divers is super retro-hardcode hard, Rail Heist is amazing, Vainger gravity switch tricks makes it rather unique, Rock On! Island is super addictive and Pingolf could be a stand alone release! Still more games to come next week.</p>
<p>Game of the week is that Wii forgotten gem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/tron_evolution_battle_grids">TRON Evolution: Battle Grids</a>. In this scribe's humble opinion still the best TRON video game ever made and clearly one destined to be forgotten by time and industry advancements. But despite all the light-cycling and disc throwing shenanigans, I need to ensure part of this weekend is spent cleaning up my new upcoming music album and ensure a smooth release in a few short days time. End of line.</p>
<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>There’s a very quirky, recently released title by Panic called Blippo+, which is basically a TV simulator where you pick up the broadcasts of a distant alien planet where '80s New Wave culture is the norm! The fun thing about it is that you can use a single Joy-Con vertically to as a remote, and it gives me vivid flashbacks of surfing channels on a CRT and stumbling across late-night public access shows as a kid. There’s not much “game” to it, but it’s utterly unique.</p>
<p>I absolutely love Donkey Kong Bonanza<em>,</em> but I’ve been chipping away at it far too slowly and will be firing it up this weekend. Likewise, there are so many P-Switches in Mario Kart World that I’ve yet to discover and complete, and I owe it to myself to improve my paltry Knockout Tour score a little bit, so there’ll definitely be some competitive karting happening.</p>
<p>I’m really curious as to the roadmap for future updates for <em>World</em> and still find it odd that DK and Pauline have only an outfit each. I’m crossing my fingers for a <em>Bonanza</em> tie-in of some kind.</p>

<p>It's also got an fps boost on Switch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>When the 3D hand-drawn platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a> made its debut on Nintendo platforms in June, we noted how there were some performance issues across both the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>It seems the developers have now acknowledged these issues in the latest game update by addressing the frame rate on both hybrid systems. On the Switch 2, you can now look forward to 60fps, and on the original device, you can generally expect "higher fps" than before.</p>
<p>This "huge" new patch also reportedly improves some other aspects of the game. This includes a "smoother camera" and "better combat". Here's the full rundown:</p>

<p>Here's what we had to say about the frame rate of this title on the Switch and Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Switch 1, the framerate struggles at times, mostly when the game transitions into new areas on-the-fly. Moving seamlessly across the world comes at a cost, it seems. It's a shame, and although they've not spoiled my enjoyment much, they are there and it'd be really nice to have a patch to sort this (and to add the old gyro).</p>
<p>For Switch 2 players, the performance issues present on Switch 1 do carry over to the newer console, and swapping between the two (bad puns flying out of me today), there's very little difference other than perhaps a slight improvement in loading times.</p>

<p>Return to the garden later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PopCap's highly addictive tower defence series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a> is making a return on the Switch and Switch 2 later this month.</p>
<p>Before you return to the garden in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted</a>, there's a new gameplay trailer you might want to check out. It showcases the Switch 2 GameShare feature, which allows two players to enjoy Local Co-Op or PvP together.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the fine print of the trailer, the Switch 2 system must initiate the GameShare session. And users who receive software via GameShare can only play this software during the session it was shared.</p>

<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the 'Replanted' version of the original Plants vs. Zombies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cult classic, Plants vs. Zombies, returns in glorious HD! After years in Crazy Dave’s attic, the original battle between Plants and Zombies is back—bigger, brighter and crazier than ever before. Revisit the epic backyard standoffs you remember, but this time with new levels, fresh twists, and 15 years of never-before-seen franchise history at your fingertips. Relive the glory days of Peashooters, Sunflowers, and brain-hungry chaos. Rejoin the ultimate garden defense and experience the backyard brawl that started a phenomenon—now back for a new era!"</p>
