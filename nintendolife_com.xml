<p>The film's listing on the <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> (FTIA) website has seen a status update this week, with the former "Pre-Production" stamp changing to the much more promising "In Production" — that's what we like to see.</p>
<p>The main filming location is listed on the site as Wellington, New Zealand, a common spot for bringing fantasy lands to the big screen, as previously used for <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> trilogy, <strong>Avatar</strong> and <strong>King Kong</strong>.</p>
<p>The FTIA provides the following project summary for the upcoming movie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness. The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce—an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, we've known for a while that the Zelda movie would be shooting in New Zealand in November 2025, but it's exciting to see that production status change!</p>
<p>The film is set to release on 7th May 2027 — assuming there are no more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">delays</a>. The only casting that we know of so far is <strong>Renegade Nell</strong>'s Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda and <strong>The Haunting of Bly Manor</strong>'s Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link, but we'd be surprised if we don't get a few more face reveals in the next year or so.</p>

<p>If we find out anything else about this first game update for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, we'll let you know. And if you want to learn more about this new Hyrule Warriors game, check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</p>

This includes the main modes and even mini games, and towards the end, there's another look at the new Kirby Air Riders amiibo line. When an English version of this trailer is released, we'll provide an update.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ad95ee153772b"><a title="Pokémon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad95ee153772b/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 in October, Game Freak has now rolled out Version 1.0.2.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese website for the game, this update contains bug fixes tied to Mega Evolutions, side missions and "other issues", and also makes some adjustments to ranked battles. Here's the rundown courtesy of a rough translation, and if we get hold of the English patch notes, we'll update this post.</p>
<h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A - Version 1.0.2 (6th November 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>The following bugs have been fixed:</strong></p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59syqwlg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>If you have not opened the box screen since the box was full before the first Mega Evolution battle, you will definitely fail to capture a Pokemon. Also, if you proceed with a side mission that allows you to obtain a Pokemon in that state, you will not be able to complete it.</li>
<li>In some side missions, if the day/night change occurs at the same time that a skill is hit on a target, it will no longer be possible to hit the target with a skill, and the side mission will no longer be able to progress.</li>
<li>During a trainer battle, if the opposing trainer switches Pokemon and the player simultaneously Mega Evolves, the opposing trainer will not be able to send out a Pokemon and will be unable to proceed.</li>
<li>Fixed some other issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rank Battle Balance Adjustments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustment of points earned based on ranking so that points are not reduced depending on the outcome of the match.</li>
<li>Some battle rewards that can be received for each battle have been added and increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>*The latest update data is required to play online features.<br>
*Local communication is not compatible with previous versions. Please make sure that you and the people you play with have the same update data version.</p>
<hr>
<p>If we hear anything else significant about this latest game update, we'll let you know. And in case you missed it, The Pokémon Company has also announced it will be sharing some news about the upcoming DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a> later today, so be on the lookout for that.</p>
