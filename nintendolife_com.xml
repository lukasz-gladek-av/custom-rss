<p>Nintendo is gearing up for its next Switch 2 release of the year in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which will serve up tons of multiplayer fun and expensive adventure mode on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>So, it's no surprise we've got a brand new commercial to prepare us for some time on the courts with our friends and family. But it's also reminding us of days long gone by, when Wiimotes were in every household and playing a few rounds of golf or bowling with your mum or grandma was a once a week affair rather than just a holiday thing.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Mario Tennis Aces is going all-in on showing off the multiplayer side, but in a way that very much harks back to the Wii. At least, it does to us. A slice of a motion-controlled match between the kids, the family serving up family goodness on the sofa? Oh, and do we spy the purple and green Joy-Con 2 in there, as well?</p>
<p>There are a few snippets of gameplay in there, too — some of the Fever Racket skills, the Wonder Flower, different types of nets — but ultimately, Nintendo is clearly pushing the family-friendly and Wii-era of multiplayer here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/round-up-the-final-previews-are-in-for-mario-tennis-fever">Previews for Mario Tennis Fever dropped yesterday</a> from a number of outlets, and we also got a little bit of time with the game on Switch 2. And things are looking pretty positive so far. Game, set, match, then? We'll have to wait just over a week to get our hands on the racket.</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to Mario Tennis Fever? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

Well, thankfully, in addition to brand-new upcoming titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a>, Nintendo has also introduced some hefty free updates for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>.</p>
<p>When questioned about this decision during Nintendo's recent financials <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf">Q&amp;A session</a>, president Shuntaro Furukawa explained that it was crucial to maintain positive contact with original Switch owners by introducing new content for popular titles. This allows them to remain within the Switch ecosystem while they ponder upgrading to the Switch 2 in their own time.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5hjnqgy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's what Furukawa said (translated via Google):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In January, we released a free update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Since the update, many consumers have been playing the game, including some who had been away for a while but have returned to the game. We've also seen an increase in the number of people revisiting Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the Switch 2, so we believe we've started the year on a good note.</p>
<p>"To popularize a new platform, it's necessary to regularly release new titles. Additionally, as we transition from Switch to Switch 2 over the next several years, we believe it's extremely important to maintain contact with consumers who already own Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>"In that sense, we wanted to update Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Splatoon 3, which have been big sellers on the Switch, at this time to allow more people to play them on the Switch, and create a flow that allows customers to switch to the Switch 2 at their own convenience, such as when new titles that interest them are released. From this perspective, we believe that updating the software for the Switch, which has a large number of units in use, is meaningful in order to maintain operation and encourage people to play again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll update this post when Nintendo posts the English translation of the Q&amp;A later this week, but Furukawa's answer seems pretty straightforward, right? Keep current Switch owners engaged and aware while the company transitions over to the Switch 2 – simple!</p>
<p>Naturally, Nintendo will eventually begin to wind down support for the Switch entirely, but we imagine it'll keep a close eye on how many owners will move over to the Switch 2 over the next year or two. The Switch has a ridiculously large install base, so Nintendo will be keen to stay in customers' good books.</p>

<p>As is customary, we thought it wise to throw a bunch of predictions into the ring and see what Nintendo's partner publishers might be cooking up for the Switch and Switch 2 in the coming months. We already have the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> on the way, but we reckon there's room for a <em>lot</em> more.</p>
<p>As ever, we encourage you to share your own predictions with a comment in the usual place, but for now, let's see what Team NL thinks will be announced in the upcoming Direct...</p>

<h2>Fantasy Isn't Dead - Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b1239656cdb6"><a title="Direct Predictions 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b1239656cdb6/direct-predictions-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hello, yes, I’m going to gently ask for more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>…</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a nice way to start out the Switch 2’s 2026, isn’t it? I bet Atlus will bring <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> to the table. I don’t know whether I’ll make time to play through it again… but gosh, it’d be nice to make it available on another platform. It’s my favourite modern Atlus game.</p>
<p>Capcom’s Switch 2 support will continue, too, and I think there’s a good chance <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will pop up, seeing as they’re working on improvements for other platforms.</p>
<p>Two games I want to see more of are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> – two very different ones, I know, but the former looks <em>beautiful</em> and the latter is just more HD-2D but in action form.</p>
<p>I’ll end things on another Square Enix prediction (which is on-brand): Final Fantasy… <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">XIV</a>. Yep. I reckon this could be a big showcase for the company anyway (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a>, anyone?), so why not throw in something extra?</p>
<h2>Arise Now, ye Tarnished - Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<figure data-uuid="25588ed099d64"><a title="Direct Predictions 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25588ed099d64/direct-predictions-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, I'll make the most of these invincibility frames and dodge roll right into the most obvious picks of the bunch. I think this is when we get an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> date. It has been cropping up at far too many public events to still be <em>that far</em> off, and I can't imagine FromSoft wants to extend the delay any longer than it has to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> feels likely, too. It's weird how much of the Switch 2 reveal Direct was dedicated to this one (it even got a Creator's Voice spotlight afterwards), and then we've heard... nothing since. Give this little rat boy some more info!</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll throw in all of the usual suspects that I like to get out on a prayer. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> Switch 2 port, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> on Switch (it's too big for an Indie World now, I reckon), Nintendo's finally given the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> guys a devkit. Go on, let's have a release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a>, too — I need this game to come out before Level-5 destroys my enthusiasm completely.</p>
<h2>Come Out Swinging - Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<figure data-uuid="007777613c997"><a title="Direct Predictions 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/007777613c997/direct-predictions-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/alan_wake_2">Alan Wake 2</a> with the DLC bundled; kind of the equivalent of the <strong>Resident Evil Gold Editions</strong>, y’know? It’s also a bit of a long shot, but I think it’s time <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/psychonauts">Psychonauts</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/psychonauts_2">its sequel</a> came to the Switch 2. And let’s get another fighting collection from Capcom, hm? I know we’re kinda running out of titles at this point, but I’m sure there’s room for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultra_street_fighter_iv">Ultra Street Fighter IV</a> somewhere.</p>
<p>Sticking with the fighters for a moment, I know y’all are hankering for <strong>Capcom vs. SNK 3</strong>. Me too, man, me too. I think the Switch 2 has a real shot at being a legit destination for fighters, and an announcement here would give it a real boost with the FGC.</p>
<p>Capcom won’t stop there though – oh no. Given that it recently took part in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">huge preview event with Nintendo</a>, this paves the way for some other titles. Resident Evil’s 30th anniversary is on the way, so it’s about time we get the OG trilogy on Switch and Switch 2. Don’t stop there, though. Give us a remastered port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Outbreak</a>, dagnabbit!</p>
<p>Oh, and Ubisoft will fail to read the room with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance</a> update.</p>
