<figure><a title="NL Reader Survey 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1216dcd0f6c54/nl-reader-survey-2025.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It's <em>that</em> time of year again folks. We would <em>love</em> to ask you some questions and would greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to respond to our anonymous survey.</p>
<p>Why is this important to us? Our websites survive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/ownership#how-does-site-make-money">mainly due to those</a> who choose to advertise their games on our websites. Advertisers typically (and understandably) want to know who they are advertising to, therefore, our survey gives us a snapshot view of our audience in 2025.</p>
<p>This year we're trying to keep things quite focused and have boiled everything down to 20 simple questions. Some of them are about you, some of them about which platforms you own and the games you buy and finally where you typically get your gaming news. All questions are optional, but any personal questions will contain a 'Prefer not to say' option.</p>
<p>We are running the same survey across all Hookshot websites; that is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>. You only need to answer it once, and it doesn't matter which site you do it on.</p>
<p>We will run more site-specific surveys in due course.</p>

<h3 data-toc="About You" id="about-you">About You <sup>(1 of 4)</sup></h3>
<p>Firstly, we need to know a little bit about <em>you</em>. Please remember that this information is <em>always</em> anonymised and helps potential advertisers know what kind of audience they can reach on our websites. All questions are optional or have 'Prefer not to say' options.</p>
<h3 data-toc="Gaming Platforms" id="gaming-platforms">Gaming Platforms <sup>(2 of 4)</sup></h3>
<p>Next, we want to understand which gaming hardware you currently own, what you intend to buy soon and which subscriptions you currently have.</p>
<h3 data-toc="Gaming Habits" id="gaming-habits">Gaming Habits <sup>(3 of 4)</sup></h3>
<p>Next, we'd like to understand how many games you buy, where you buy them, what format and genres you prefer.</p>
<h3 data-toc="Gaming News" id="gaming-news">Gaming News <sup>(4 of 4)</sup></h3>
<p>Finally, we want to see which of our websites you visit and where else you typically get your gaming news.</p>
