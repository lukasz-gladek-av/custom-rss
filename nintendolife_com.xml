Let's see who's working through their backlog to make way for the oncoming deluge of releases in another edition of What Are You Playing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Direct</a> was the big news for this week, bringing with it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/surprise-hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-launches-today">shadow drop</a>, release dates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/indiana-jones-cracks-his-whip-on-switch-2-on-12th-may-2026">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-launches-24th-february-for-switch-2">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-gets-a-release-date-for-switch-2">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/switch-2-exclusive-orbitals-mixes-anime-visuals-and-co-op-puzzle-platforming-this-summer">another peek</a> at the awesome-looking co-op adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a>.</p>
<p>It was also a big week for previews, as we shared our hands-on thoughts of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/so-far-super-mario-bros-wonder-on-switch-2-isnt-making-a-great-case-for-itself">Super Mario Bros.

<p>All in all, a rather busy one, then! Let's see what everyone's kicking back with this weekend.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:197043,196663 @ 1770462055 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I find myself in a rare position of being <em>between games</em> at the moment, so I've actually started to fill in one of my biggest blind spots that's haunted my backlog for years: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>. I know, I know, I really should have played this one already, but I haven't, alright! I'm putting things right now, I promise.</p>
<p>I'm only an hour or two in at this point, and it's... weird. I like it, but it's definitely weird. Stay tuned for more revelations.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>Drama intensifies as I cleared <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> up to chapter 14. Not sure I will be able to finish it this weekend, but if not, it will very likely be the fault of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> demos. Shadow dropping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a> (and <strong>Ganbare Goemon! Collection</strong> on the Japanese eShop!) was unexpected and something I will certainly make some time to revisit. Smooth progress continues on the story mode of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a>, but it will have to share its wheel with the shiny and chrome new release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/carmageddon-rogue-shift">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a>. Too many games for only 48 hours, send help!</p><p>

My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a>. I admit to not having completed the game back in the PlayStation era (too many great games coming out every single week!), but I really enjoyed the demo. Adulting truly is the greatest nemesis of JRPGs, and looking at the release schedule ahead, 2026 will indeed be the year of JRPGs on both Switches!</p></div>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>More <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a> for me. I've recently learned the DIY recipe for Glowing Stickers and can use them to make cool custom patterns for my walls which don't have to be stuck on a square canvas. Which means the various features of my Trek-themed house can now look infinitely more impressive!</p>
<p>Trouble is, I now need to find a reliable supply of that weird green moss to craft the bloody things before I can customise. Lots of trips to faraway islands with Kapp'n this weekend, then. Wish me luck, folks.</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>It’ll be no surprise what I’ll be playing this week. My copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on the 3DS arrived this week so I’ve been making it a prework/morning routine of checking on my weirdos. (Yes I made Alex!) I’m really enjoying it so far and it’s perfect to get me ready for when the new one comes out. Outside of that, I have plenty more games on my backlog to finish so I’ll likely play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> this weekend and finally try out the most recent DLC. I’m not far from completing the game but I can’t help but get distracted by fishing for hours and avoiding the creatures as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>PIKMIN! I’m playing lots of Pikmin at the moment. I purchased two Game Vouchers before Nintendo killed the service, and since I finally discovered the Pikmin series last year, I thought it was about time I checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve beaten Pikmin 3 already, though I’ll be jumping back in this weekend and starting it on a higher difficulty – I honestly had no idea how short it is, but it’s still a banger. Pikmin 4, meanwhile, is just on another level. It’s wonderful, and I absolutely love the new camera angle. There’s a lot of chit-chat at the beginning, but I feel like I’ve gotten through the worst of it now. This might be cropping up quite a bit in future WAYP features…</p>

<p>No, not that one</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Pokémon is celebrating 30 years this year, and as part of this, trainers around the globe can expect all sorts of exciting (and surprising) announcements.</p>
<p>Ahead of the annual event Pokémon Day, taking place later this month on 27th February 2026, Stern Pinball has announced it will be stepping into the battle arena with its very own themed pinball cabinet. And yes, we're referring to an <em>actual</em> pinball cabinet here (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_pinball">not a video game</a>).</p>
<p>The price of admission? Well, according to the <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">official landing page</a>, it'll be <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">available in three varieties</a> and is "coming soon". The Pro model starts at <strong>$6,999</strong>, the premium model is <strong>$9,699</strong> and the "highly collectible Limited Edition model" is going for <strong>$12,999</strong>. This particular model is also <strong>limited to 750 units</strong> "globally".</p>

<p>If you want <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">future updates about this cabinet</a> and when exactly it drops, you can sign up for email updates on the official website. And if you're ready to purchase or happen to be a business owner (or just want to enquire about one), you can also fill out a form for that.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the prices for this Pokémon cabinet are in line with the current offerings on Stern's website, which include cabinets based on series such as Star Wars, X-Men, and Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>Here's what the critics had to say</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="d245c705831a7"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d245c705831a7/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's an action-packed week on the Nintendo front, and on top of the Partner Direct, we also shared a bunch of previews earlier this week.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen our preview for Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park we're not so sure about it so far. Here's what staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the £16.99 / $19.99 Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196663 @ 1770459695 -->
<p>So, what did other critics have to say? Here's the round up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/03/amusing-attractions-in-an-attractive-amusement-park">Game Informer</a>: "Meetup in Bellabel Park is about what I expected based on the trailers, and that's a good thing. I had a great time in Attraction Central, and knowing there are so many more stages in each minigame has me looking forward to playing the full release with some family on my couch."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-dlc-meetup-bellabel-park-preview/">Polygon</a>: "<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, <em>Jamboree TV</em>, and <em>Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> all serve similar purposes: They show what kind of play is possible with Switch 2 and leave you excited to see what Nintendo can do in a full Mario Party or WarioWare game. The novelty factor that currently makes add-ons like this fun to toy around with is bound to wear off before the console’s one-year anniversary. If mouse controls are going to be more than a bonus gimmick, we’re going to need some more substantial games that make use of the feature soon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/preview-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-meetup-in-bellabel-park/">DualShockers</a>: "If you have a friend group you can line up to play together with on a game night, or perhaps some gamer kiddos on hand in your household, Super Mario Bros. Wonder for the Switch 2 is absolutely going to be a winner that you can break out time and time again."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-already-tired-of-nintendo-switch-2-editions-and-even-new-mario-wonder-content-cant-change-that">IGN</a>: "Each game certainly had some fun to offer, but afterwards I couldn’t help but feel like this concept is awkwardly straddling the line: if I wanted multiplayer mayhem with Mario characters, there are so many other, better options like Mario Kart, Party, or 3D World, just to name a few. And, if I wanted 2D Mario, I’d much rather play the traditional Super Mario Bros. Wonder campaign, which I adore. To be completely fair, there is more traditional content on the way in Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition in the form of Wonder Effect boss fights against the returning Koopalings and extra challenges that take place in pre-existing levels, but I didn’t get to try any of that at this preview event. Even so, none of this Edition’s additions currently feel as exciting as a couple of extra brand-new worlds likely would have."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-wonder-turns-into-mario-party-with-the-bellabel-park-expansion/1100-6537843/">GameSpot</a>: "None of these minigames would be worth the price of admission on their own, but altogether, the package looks to be substantial. We only got a taste of a handful of the minigames during our multiplayer session, and each one we tried had multiple difficulty levels with different stages to try. I also got the sense that there was more to be discovered, possibly through the collection of those special coins that were so tricky to get during the cooperative stages."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/57278-hands-on-with-switch-2-s-early-2026-lineup-mario-tennis-fever-meetup-in-bellabel">GoNintendo</a>: "Your interest in this add-on will likely be dependent on how often you’re able to get a group of friends together to play. If you’ve got a core gaming group, and you’re the type who likes a silly collection of multiplayer games in the vein of Nintendo Land or Mario Party, Bellabel Park should fit the bill."</p>

<p>It's available at select Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart Stores in the US. And in Canada, you can take to the court at Best Buy and Walmart.</p>
<p>Nintendo's in-store Switch 2 kiosks have also offered demos for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Unfortunately, there's no mention of this latest first-party demo being made available on the eShop (<em>at least yet</em>), but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although we didn't share a full preview of this title, Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds recently went hands on with the new entry, and thinks Mario Tennis fans will be "absolutely thrilled" with the new title. We've also done a previews round up if you would like to find out more about this new game.</p>

<p>In some related news, earlier this week, Nintendo announced it would be <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/serve-up-fun-mario-tennis-fever-feb-12-nintendo-san-francisco/">hosting special launch events</a> for Mario Tennis Fever at its stores in New York and San Francisco. These events will feature the game demo, photo ops, a gift alongside the purchase of the title and more.</p>

<p>This will revive classic games, originally released on home consoles, on modern hardware. Two titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and the PlayStation title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> are already available on the Switch 2 eShop, so what else is on the way?</p>
<p>Hamster has now provided details about what else is on the way in its <a href="https://youtu.be/eaIlTJyYR30">latest Japanese broadcast</a>. It features many of the games showcased in the initial announcement. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-doraemon">Doraemon</a> by Hudson has been dated for July, but the rest of these games don't have a release date just yet.</p>
<p>For now, here's what's on the way in the near future (via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong> (Tecmo 8-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>

<p>The demo went live on Switch 2 this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has finally released its demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2 and some side-by-side comparisons to the other versions of the game have now been shared online.</p>
<p>If you are wondering this version holds up, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/64-XoEHbp-o">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, the Switch 2 will run at a lower resolution than the Xbox Series S version, but upscaling is supposedly better on Nintendo's console. This is also said to apply to the Switch 2's filtering and shadow quality, which shows "better results".</p>
<p>As for the game's frame rate, all consoles target 60fps, but the Switch 2 release apparently struggles to maintain this frame rate during more heated moments.</p>

<p>Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">recently previewed Pragmata</a> and had the following things to say about the game's performance and resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It felt pretty stable and consistent during my time with it. There are a few visual downgrades compared to the likes of PS5 with some muddy textures and a slightly fuzzy resolution, but it’s a handsome game nonetheless with impressive lighting and a strong art style."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you tried out the Pragmata demo on the Switch 2 yet? What are your thoughts so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>
