<p>"The work of The Traveler is eternal"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you happened to miss it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is out now on the Switch 2, and it's really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">rather good</a>.</p>
<p>Despite leaning heavily on tried-and-tested survival horror tropes, Bloober Team's latest delivers a fascinating story involving time travel, big helmets, and gross, gooey creatures that have the ability to merge with dead bodies. Gross. If you're a genre fan or you simply enjoy well-told stories, this one might be for you.</p>
<p>To highlight its support for the Switch 2, Bloober Team has concocted an awesome new live-action trailer that showcases the game's two timelines while demonstrating multiple methods of control, including the Switch 2's mouse mode. You can watch it first right here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest new IP from Bloober, with the team recently garnering critical acclaim for its work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake on PS5. It's been confirmed that a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> is also in the works, but we sincerely hope that Bloober is keen to expand the world of Cronos in the future too.</p>

<p>60 minutes of Switch and Switch 2 news</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a8a22963cba0/nintendo-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well it's that time again, folks! Nintendo has announced via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> that yet <em>another</em> Direct presentation will be taking place on <strong>12th September 2025</strong> (yes, that's this Friday), hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> in July and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> in August.</p>
<p>The showcase is set to kick off at <strong>2</strong><strong>pm BST / 3pm CEST / 6am ET / 9am PT</strong> and will provide 60 minutes' worth of news and announcements on games heading to the Switch 2 (and possibly the Switch). You can find the exact time that things get underway in your region below.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As ever, the full presentation will be streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional variant), and we'll also be hosting a stream right here on Nintendo Life, so you can watch along with us and have a good old natter about all of the announcements.</p>

<p>As for what's in store..? Well, who knows. There are known quantities like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, the former of which arguably <em>needs</em> a release date at this point. Probably both of them, actually. But of course, there's likely to be a few brand-new surprises in store for 2026, too.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of Super Mario's 40th Anniversary. Kind of a big deal, y'know? Nintendo announced quite a few neat little things for the plumber's 35th anniversary, including the likes of the <strong>Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros.</strong> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch. We're expecting big things for this latest milestone.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dead-reset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-dead-reset-switch-a-gory-sci-fi-take-on-groundhog-day.1293477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Developer Wales Interactive is back with another FMV game, this time joining forces with movie studio <a href="https://darkrifthorror.com/">Dark Rift Horror</a> to present an <strong>Alien</strong>-inspired sci-fi romp with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dead_reset">Dead Reset</a>. Much like previous titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bunker">The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_dates">Five Dates</a>, this latest effort has you make key choices at frequent intervals to influence the story and, in this case, maybe survive the horrors ahead.</p>
<p>Spoiler: You won’t survive. Y’see, as the title suggests, Dead Reset is set within a time loop, with protagonist Cole Mason reliving the same moments over and over again with each subsequent death – sort of like <strong>Edge of Tomorrow</strong>, then. Taking place within a dilapidated sci-fi lab of sorts, Cole discovers that a series of experiments has led to the birth of a deadly, gruesome monster; one that emerges from the chest of a helpless victim, no less. Remind you of anything?</p>
<p>Choices made throughout the story have an effect on how the supporting characters view Cole, and these include the headstrong sidekick Fearne, the brash, trigger-happy mercenary Slade, the cold, calculating scientist Magson, and more. From a morality standpoint, it’s often obvious what kind of choice needs to be made, but Dead Reset wisely keeps you on your toes by throwing in a few surprising punishments here and there – many of which result in your bloody death.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, Dead Reset is pretty grim, with blood and guts flying all over the place. However, many of the death scenes became quite funny in a <em>“Gosh, I won’t be doing</em> that <em>again”</em> kind of way. Pacing remains fairly solid, meaning you’re not waiting around too long for the story to get going again upon each reset.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through the magic of storytelling, not every loop sends you right back to the beginning, because <em>jeez</em>, that would be terrible. Instead, you hit natural checkpoints along the way which make each subsequent death feel slightly less devastating. Overall, Dead Reset tells a compelling story that kept me locked in for its duration, and there’s definitely value in tracking down each of the four endings, along with the <em>*checks PR notes*</em> 337 unique scenes available.</p>
<p>As for general production, the image quality is superb throughout. The set design is decent, though you can definitely tell that it’s low-budget at times; the valves on the doors look like they’ve been carved out of tin cans. The performances are also a little mixed, with Daniel Thrace and Lyndsey Craine doing an admirable job throughout, while Andrina Carroll often struggles to sell the motivations of antagonist Magson.</p>
<p>It's a Switch release, although those playing on Switch 2 will need to, uh… consider not for now. The game frequently freezes, sometimes indefinitely, and although Wales Interactive is fully aware of this, the team is currently unable to apply a fix thanks to the lack of dev kits. Performance on Switch 1, mind you, is mostly fine. I experienced one of the aforementioned freezes, but it wasn’t a particularly lengthy one.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dead-reset]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Updates Two DS And 3DS Game Trademarks]]></title>

<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tomodachi / Magical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f420aa1c813e3/tomodachi-magical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has updated two trademarks relating to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/magical_starsign">Magical Starsign</a> on the DS and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on the 3DS.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1965438662197276967">Mike Odyssey</a> over on X, the trademarks are currently under examination as of 2nd September 2025 before full publication, which is normal. As for <em>why</em> they've been updated, well... that's up for debate.</p>
<p>Odyssey believes that the updates might indicate the inclusion of DS games on Nintendo Switch Online ahead of a rumoured Direct showcase later this week. And sure, that's possible, but perhaps a bit optimistic, in our opinion.</p>

<p>Take Tomodachi Life, for example: as mentioned, that's a 3DS game, and while there was a Japan-exclusive predecessor on DS called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/tomodachi_collection">Tomodachi Collection</a>, this isn't what the trademark is referring to. There's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> to consider, the Switch sequel currently scheduled to release in 2026.</p>
<p>Similarly, Magical Starsign is the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a> on the GBA, which recently saw its own release on NSO over in Japan. With both games, it could simply be that Nintendo is making sure everything is up to date and in tippity-top shape.</p>
<p>It's worth considering, however, that Nintendo does have a patent for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/newly-discovered-nintendo-filing-shows-off-dual-screen-detachable-device">'dual-screen, detachable device'</a>, which may indicate that the company is almost certainly weighing up the viability of a screen accessory for use with DS games on NSO.</p>
