<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157316/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, I was really nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. I played the first ‘<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">1 + 2</a>’ collection back in 2021 and absolutely loved it, but my early teenage years were shaped by the Birdman’s third and fourth console outings. So to say that a lot was riding on Iron Galaxy’s remake would be an understatement, and early concerns regarding THPS4’s shift in structure definitely rattled me.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can wholeheartedly say that this latest nostalgic revisit to what I would argue was the peak of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tony-hawk-games-of-all-time">the Tony Hawk’s series</a> is a success – albeit with a few caveats.</p>
<p>So let’s start with the pink elephant in the room. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tony_hawks_pro_skater_4">Pro Skater 4</a> has been drastically altered to fit more in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tony_hawks_pro_skater_3">Pro Skater 3</a> (and THPS1 + 2, for that matter). So instead of roaming about each level at your own pace and triggering missions by speaking with the local citizens, you’re instead racing against the two-minute clock, with missions completed organically as you make your way around.</p>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157323/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a bitter pill to swallow for veterans hoping for a more 1:1 remake of the original, but I have to admit that it still works pretty well as is. Yes, the levels in THPS4 are much larger than those that came before, and so tasks like collecting the S-K-A-T-E letters might prove more difficult with the ticking clock. But having the entry align more closely with the third <em>does</em> make for a more cohesive experience; one I’m certain newcomers will appreciate.</p>
<p>Speaking of cohesion, despite development moving from the now-defunct Vicarious Visions to Iron Galaxy, THPS3+4 feels instantly familiar to those who played the original games and the 2021 remake of 1 + 2. It plays exactly how you’d want, with slick, responsive controls, outrageously over-the-top combos, and heaps of potential when it comes to player and board customisation.</p>
<p>You’ve got a really solid selection of skaters to choose from, including Hawk himself, Zion Wright, Chloe Covell, and more. Unlockable characters include Bam Margera and <strong>TMNT</strong>’s Michelangelo, while if you opt for the Digital Deluxe Edition, you can also play as <strong>DOOM</strong> Slayer and the Revenant, with additional bonus music tracks included.</p>

<p>Each skater has various advantages and disadvantages, but by collecting stat points hidden around each level, you can boost everything from speed to lip balance. The good news is that if you switch skaters, you can immediately apply all stat points previously collected, so there’s no need to go through the motions again and again.</p>
<p>As for the levels themselves, they’ve been absolutely wonderfully recreated. Unlike the first two entries, 3 + 4 really leans into the whole <strong>MTV</strong> / <strong>Jackass</strong> influence and includes some truly ridiculous missions that make use of the additional NPC characters located throughout each stage. So, you can ‘Bury the Bully’ in Canada, ‘Stop the Pickpockets’ in Airport, and ‘Photobomb the Tourists’ in Alcatraz. Some missions have been altered somewhat, so don’t expect to see Ollie the Bum hallucinating pink elephants. They’re still around, but the context has been switched up a bit.</p>

<p>In addition to the familiar favourites, Iron Galaxy has also seen fit to create a few new tracks of its own, and I’ll be honest, they’re <em>awesome</em>. Waterpark in particular is a true highlight, with the myriad waterslides and empty pools making for a proper skateboarding playground begging to be combo’d into oblivion. It gives me hope that Activision could soon green-light a brand new Tony Hawk’s game, but I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>
<p>One thing I do want to call out, however, is the music. And to be clear, the soundtrack here is <em>banging</em>; really good stuff. You’ve got Iron Maiden’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qbRHY1l0vc"><strong>2 Minutes to Midnight</strong></a>, Sex Pistols <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ah1JM9mf60"><strong>Holidays in the Sun</strong></a>, Mastodon’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv_QcNplLxM"><strong>Precious Stones</strong></a>, and <em>so</em> much more. The problem, however, is that music is a powerful source of nostalgia, and the majority of the originals’ tunes have been left out, with only six tracks represented from THPS3, and four from THPS4.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that the soundtrack is really rather good, and ultimately many newcomers will discover some life-long favourites here, just like I did back in the early 2000s. But why couldn’t Iron Galaxy appeal to both crowds? I broke into a massive stupid grin when Bodyjar’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18P614-bnS4"><strong>Not the Same</strong></a> kicked in for the first time, and I just wish that the collection included a few more nostalgic hits.</p>
<p>Moving onto multiplayer, you’ve got a few options to keep you busy once you’re done with the single-player portion. One of the highlights is the new ‘HAWK’ mode, which sees you hide H-A-W-K letters around levels before riding around to locate your opponent’s letters. It’s a cool little mode, and it’s nice to see something that’s not just 'see who can score the most points'.</p>

<p>That said, while multiplayer works well, actually finding a match can take a little while. It’s early days, in one sense, but if the game’s struggling to find matches at launch, then I dread to think what it might be like in a year or two.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard multiplayer, you’ve also got the Create-A-Park mode. Here, you can try out custom parks from a hefty selection, though it’s safe to say that some of the early designs leave a bit to be desired. Heck, I can’t talk, I wouldn’t be able to do much better, but I’m definitely looking forward to seeing a few creations that don’t just rely on silly gimmicks.</p>
<p>The actual creation tool is pretty fun and intuitive, with assets selected with the D-pad and placed on the ground with the analogue sticks. You can rotate pieces, zoom in, pan the camera around – all sorts. It’s a neat little tool if you’ve got a flair for park creation, but ultimately I can’t see myself using it that much.</p>

<p>Finally, looking at how the game runs on Switch 2, I’m mostly very impressed. In handheld mode, there can be a little bit of aliasing, but by and large the game is remarkably on par with the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, hitting what feels like a solid 60fps with some gorgeous reflection technology on display with puddles.</p>
<p>The lighting looks great in levels like Tokyo and Foundry, and pop-in is thankfully kept at a minimum. Some of the NPC characters can look a little goofy at times, sure, but if anything, this felt like a callback to the original games. That’s my excuse at least – deal with it.</p>
<p>Finally, you can view some of the scenery with the game's photo mode, which works really well and adds in a number of cool little filters and effects for good measure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is another welcome return to the franchise's glory days, presenting the third and fourth entries with revamped visuals across the board while retaining the same slick gameplay. Some folks might be unable to get over the structural changes to Pro Skater 4, and I have to admit to being a little disappointed at the lack of classic music tracks, but overall, the positives absolutely outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>If you're looking to inject a hefty dose of nostalgia into your life, or you simply want to see what the Tony Hawk series was like at its absolute peak, then this should prove a fine addition to your Switch 2 library.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Feature: "It Was Hell" - Spike Chunsoft Devs Discuss 'No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES']]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/it-was-hell-spike-chunsoft-devs-discuss-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/feature-it-was-hell-spike-chunsoft-devs-discuss-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files.1241634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>At the time of writing, we're now just a few short weeks away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</a> for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>25th July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's the third entry in the <strong>AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</strong> series following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files">the original game</a> in 2019 and its direct sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files_-_nirvana_initiative">nirvanA Initiative</a>, in 2022. The series so far has been met with widespread acclaim, and the developers over at Spike Chunsoft seemingly have no desire to stop anytime soon – happy days for us, then!</p>
<p>This year's new entry puts a lot of the focus back on investigator Kaname Date following fan feedback from nirvanA initiative. It also sees developer Kazuya Yamada take the reigns as director and scenario writer, with veteran Kotaro Uchikoshi serving as series director and scenario supervisor. We recently caught up with both to find out more about the game, their roles in its development, and what kind of wacky dreams they've been having recently...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: How would you define No Sleep For Kaname Date? How does it fit in with the overall story of the series?</strong></p>
<figure><a title="Kaname Date 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/644782d36828c/kaname-date-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Director and scenario writer Kazuya Yamada — <em>Image: Kazuya Yamada</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kazuya Yamada:</strong> Our mission was to "listen to as many opinions as possible from our fans," and the development team, myself included, has become part of the fan base. In that sense, I think the theme of this project is something like, "Let’s all have a fan appreciation event together." That said, I believe we've created a number of settings that could be used as the series continues. If Uchikoshi-san can make good use of them, I'll feel satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Kotaro Uchikoshi:</strong> When I first heard from the producer, I remember him saying, "It's going to be something like a companion piece." But in reality, it turned out to be more of a true sequel, so much so that it could have been officially the "3" in the series. That applies not just to the overall game, but also to the storyline as well. I'm sure fans will be satisfied with the game, so please look forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>No Sleep For Kaname Date puts a lot of the focus back on the titular protagonist as a playable character - can you tell us more about the story and how you came up with it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> The story begins when Date, who is once again the protagonist, receives a call from Iris who has been abducted by a UFO. As Date searches for Iris's whereabouts, he comes across a mysterious device with a sign attached to it that reads "Psync me." While investigating, he finds a connection to the place where Iris is being held captive.</p>
<p>The story follows his journey to unravel these mysteries, rescue Iris, and solve the case. The story this time was built around the requirement of "making Date the protagonist." We explored a variety of ideas and, taking Uchikoshi’s feedback into account, made adjustments little by little—like carving a sculpture.</p>

<p><strong>Yamada-san, you have moved into the role of Director for this game. How has this experience been for you, and what support have you received from Uchikoshi-san?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I served as both director and scenario writer, and in a word, it was hell. I was honestly impressed that Uchikoshi-san was able to take on such an outrageous workload. I'm even thinking of putting up a sign in the office that says, "Don't be both director and scenario writer, or it may prove fatal."</p>
<p>Despite his busy schedule, Uchikoshi-san not only pointed out things about the scenario but also gave me suggestions like, "If you do it this way, it'll be more interesting." I'm eternally grateful to him. Of course, I appreciated all of his feedback, but more than that, he also knew exactly how much to praise and flatter me, just the right amount. It really helped me stay sane.</p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> I supervised the plot that Yamada-san wrote. For example, I gave him advice on the AI series setting, such as, "The introduction needs to have more impact, so how about this?", "This part is too similar to the last game. Why not try changing it like this?", "As a mystery, it might be better to make this character less suspicious", "It would be better to deliberately hide this fact", "The story would probably develop better if this character didn't know this", "How about making this character the one who orchestrated a certain event?", "As part of the AI series, there’s a certain essence missing, so it would be best to add this", and so on.</p>
<p><strong>There are three distinct gameplay elements in No Sleep For Kaname Date - Investigate, Somnium, and Escape. How do you find the balance between these to ensure the player is entertained and not overwhelmed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> One of the series's trademarks is that we aim to have just the right amount of confusion, but we were also careful to structure the game so that players can focus on the task at hand, whether it's an Escape or Somnium section, while keeping the information organised and easy to follow. The difficulty has been fine-tuned as well, so whether you're confident or not, you should be able to progress at a level that suits you. (If you set the difficulty to the lowest setting, you should be able to complete it even while drunk.)</p>

<p><strong>You've developed the game for the Switch 2 alongside the Switch - what have you been able to achieve with Nintendo’s new console that wasn't possible on the original Switch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> On the original Nintendo Switch, it was extremely difficult to maintain processing speed, and there were parts we had to give up on. However, with Nintendo Switch 2, the hardware capabilities have simply improved, allowing for smooth performance.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there any games outside of the AI SOMNIUM series that you've looked to for inspiration for this latest release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I don't think there's much of a direct influence, but I do think that the <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> series, the <strong>SaGa</strong> series, and the <strong>Yakuza</strong> series have influenced my approach to game development and scenario writing. What I think they have in common is their willingness to go beyond expectations and include twists and elements that make you think, "Wait, are they really allowed to do that?"</p>
<p><strong>What kind of feedback have you received from fans of AI SOMNIUM and how has this influenced your approach with this new game?</strong></p>
<figure><a title="Kaname Date 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103d544e5e3a9/kaname-date-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Series director and scenario supervisor Kotaro Uchikoshi — <em>Image: Kotaro Uchikoshi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> We received a range of feedback, from how the characters are handled to the quality of life of the gameplay system. Among these, the most impactful piece was, "I wanted to see more of Date’s exploits." Based on this, Date returned as the protagonist.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi-san, I recall you saying that you came up with the story for The nirvanA Initiative from a dream. Have either of you had any further dreams that might have influenced this new game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I had a dream where I was kidnapped by members of the mafia who make movies as a hobby. I was forced to write a script under 24-hour surveillance and couldn't leave the room until their boss was satisfied. Meanwhile, I watched my wife being seduced right in front of me, and I cried uncontrollably. It was too sad, so I didn't use it as any kind of reference.</p>
<p>The part about being confined and forced to write a script kind of came true later on, so I strongly hope and pray that the latter part never comes true. Every day, I try to do good deeds and build up my karma.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> Yamada-san wrote the scenario, so it doesn't include any elements from my dreams. However, I once had a dream in which a man with his lower body exposed was lying on his back on a conveyor belt, and the part of him that was erect--let’s call it “D”--was wearing medieval armour. As the conveyor belt moved forward, D swung and mowed down these approaching monsters. If there’s an opportunity, I might use that somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>How many more stories could potentially be told in the AI SOMNIUM series? Do you have an ending in mind at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> From my perspective, with a work like this one, I can expand the scenario and develop it endlessly if there’s even the slightest chance. So if given the opportunity, I believe it could continue for a long time, just like <strong>The Simpsons</strong>.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> There are about as many stories to tell as there are in <strong>One Piece</strong>. I'll probably still be writing them by the time the Anunnaki aliens return, so I'd like to think about the ending after that.</p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi-san, you worked closely with Kazutaka Kodaka on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a>, and he also has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a> launching later this year too. Do you discuss your individual projects with each other and provide feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> We hardly ever talk about individual projects, but every now and then, Kodaka will casually mention an interesting idea for something I'm working on, and I kind of keep those ideas in the back of my mind.<strong><br></strong></p>
