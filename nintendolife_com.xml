</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> was released for the Switch at the end of last month, and now in an update, Sega has locked in the first Season Pass DLC release date.</p>
<p>This included a teaser trailer and the confirmation that the paid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Pack is out this week on 8th October 2025. It contains Steve, Alex and Creeper, along with a new track. This is available in the Season Pass and Digital Deluxe Edition, or you can purchase the standalone pack.</p>

<p>This will also be joined by the in-game Minecraft Festival, which will run from 9th October 2025 until 12th October 2025 and is free to join, even if you don't have access to the pack.</p>
<p>This pack will be followed by SpongeBob, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man">Mega Man</a>, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Avatar: Legends.

<p>Legends: Z-A will also be available on the Switch</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>As we've already mentioned, October is a huge month for the Switch 2 (and Switch) with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>So far, there's been some Mega reveals and distribution events announced, and now Nintendo has sunk some of its marketing budget for the game into a commercial featuring the 'Stranger Things' star, Gaten Matarazzo.</p>
<p>The Netflix series is currently in its fifth season, and although there are no links here, Matarazzo is known to be a big fan of Nintendo and has previously teamed up with the company to promote titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this new commercial we get to see the star harness the power of Mega Evolutions, while also highlighting how the Switch 2 is just as playable, when you're out and about, as Nintendo's original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A launches for the Switch 2 and original Switch on 16th October 2025. It's arriving in between an already action-packed month of game releases. The new Pokémon game will also be joined by a new Switch 2 bundle on the same date, which includes a copy of the latest entry.</p>

<p>We're taking baby steps with this one</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="bc74c5000bab3"><a title="Nintendo Life Image" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc74c5000bab3/nintendo-life-image.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday surprised <em>everyone</em> with a new animated short called '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-goes-full-pixar-in-strange-new-animated-short-film-close-to-you">Close To You</a></strong>', and it's already led to all sorts of theories online.</p>
<p>We know Nintendo is currently in the process of expanding beyond video games with theme parks and movies (<em>we're looking at you,</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a>). It's also got its video production company '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/nintendo-launches-official-website-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">Nintendo Pictures</a>' and recently launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">Mario product line in Japan</a> for younger audiences, made up of rattles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">building blocks with amiibo functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Then there's perhaps the most common claim that this new video is tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>. If you watch the short, it appears there's <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1975553503524458919"><em>something</em> invisible</a> moving all the objects in the scene, and Nintendo enthusiasts online have <a href="https://x.com/RogersBase/status/1975703210863304718">seemingly matched up the music</a> in this trailer with the game series.</p>
<p>We've even got <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/53641-nintendo-drops-close-to-you-animated-short-update">past quotes from Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto</a> telling us how Pikmin are "all over our world" and "invisible to the naked eye". So, what do you think? Is this something to do with Pikmin, or do you think it's something completely different? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>That's not all, though. Heck, we've already had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, and this week <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a> returns. Further into this month, Switch and Switch 2 owners can look forward to various other titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Katamari</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and Yacht Club Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> has also been delayed at the last minute, so it will no longer make Halloween.</p>

<p>Ready to save the planet?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Square Enix have published a brand new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, the upcoming Switch 2 version of the 2020 PS4 original --which later got a PS5 upgrade <em>and</em> DLC.</p>
<p>Today's trailer acts as a bit of a rundown of the game's setting, Midgard, as well as the many factions within the sprawling metropolis. If you've already played the game on Sony's consoles or on PC, or even just played the original, you'll be <em>very</em> familiar with these names, but it's still worth a look.</p>
<p>Of course, Midgar is the setting for the entirety of the game — which is essentially the opening area in the OG PS1 release. The city acts as the base of the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation that is monopolising the planet's energy and using it to power Midgar.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6294790c3c26"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6294790c3c26/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If planet-killing technologies weren't enough, then the company also has The Turks, a special task force who are left with "the company's dirty work", often involving assassinations, kidnapping, and other rather unsavoury things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a group opposing Shinra — Avalanche, a group you and Cloud will find yourself aligning with. They’re attempting to stop Shinra's abuse of power and save the planet by destroying Mako Reactors, which siphon the planet's energy.</p>

<p>And of course, to round the video off, we get a little snippet of info on both Cloud and Sephiroth — though it's safe to say <em>everyone</em> has heard of those. Right? <em>Riiiight?</em></p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, has been speaking <em>a lot</em> about the upcoming Switch 2 port lately. He's spoken about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/i-feel-a-great-responsibility-to-get-it-right-naoki-hamaguchi-on-the-pressure-of-remaking-final-fantasy-vii">feeling "a great responsibility"</a> to get the Remake right as well as how the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">team got the lighting just right</a> for this rerelease.</p>
<p>Plus, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">should be getting a demo</a> sometime before the game's 22nd <strong>January 2026</strong> release date, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
