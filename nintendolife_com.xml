<p>Releasing on Switch 2 (and Switch) next month</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In case you missed it, Marvelous and XSEED are bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> to the Switch 2 and Switch next month.</p>
<p>It's already released some trailers and today it's followed this up with a five-minute overview trailer – introducing players to their new life in Zephyr and the bazaar, where they'll use all the services to grow their farm and make the community thrive once again.</p>
<p>In this video, you can also see some of the gameplay in action. This includes the ability to glide about the world, and enjoy many past times from fishing to horse riding. This trailer is only in Japanese right now, but there's more than enough on display to give you an idea of what to expect. If we see an English version of this video released, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This game arrives next month on <strong>27th August 2025</strong> and will be getting a "full physical release" on Switch 2.</p>

<p>As global cumulative sales surpass one million</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/694fa330e1d0f/fantasy-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> got off to a positive start in May, and it seems we've now got an official update from Level-5 – with the company announcing today the "global cumulative sales" for the title have now surpassed 1.2 million units. This figure combines all version sales including Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Along with this, the Japanese company has confirmed a Switch 2 physical version will release on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> in Japan. According to listings on sites like VGP, the Japanese release will be available on the same date locally, supports "multi-language" and the game is apparently "on the cart" ("like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></strong>") with pre-orders now live (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/fantasy-life-i-nintendo-switch-2-physical-edition-photo-mode/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>

<p>Along with this, Level-5 has also announced a Photo Mode will be added to the game including features such as pose settings. There'll also be a contest for this new mode allowing users to showcase their islands, homes, and more. This mode reportedly arrives "later" this month in July.</p>
<p>The additional free DLC '<strong>Update the World</strong>' is also planned and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-free-dlc-will-steal-more-time-in-huge-roguelike-open-world-mode">will transform the Fantasy Life i</a> into a roguelike, open world adventure. If you haven't already bought the game, on the Switch 2, there's also a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-gets-switch-2-release-date-with-paid-upgrade-path-for-switch-1-players">paid upgrade path for a small sum</a>.</p>

<p>Drop in this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The legendary skater <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk</a> is back this week and this time he's revisiting the third and fourth games across all platforms including the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Returning skaters can expect to drop into both new and old parks – shredding up places like the Foundry, Alcatraz, College and new locations like an <em>entire</em> pinball machine. On top of this are new and returning cast members, as well as multiple modes to work your way through.</p>
<p>The reviews for this anticipated release are now rolling in and while we should hear more about the Nintendo versions later this week, we've now got the first lot of impressions to give us an idea of how the game is performing so far. Here's the round up:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182162 @ 1751958923 -->
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">GameSpot</a> has given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> <strong>8/10</strong> and although it's "still the best skateboarding gameplay around" it's not all that happy about the decisions made with the fourth outing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a phenomenal game of skate, one that fans would flock to without hesitation if it weren't for some of the strange decisions regarding the game's Career mode and THPS 4 levels. Some of the changes feel needless, and overall, THPS 4 just doesn't fit as well into the same structure as the original three games...Once the initial disappointment fades, however, you're left with a remake that still handles as well as these games ever have, and that's something that's worth playing no matter who you are."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">IGN</a> also settled on a score of <strong>8/10</strong> - calling it a "largely successful rejuvenation" of the 2001 and 2002 originals, despite the changes to the fourth outing's formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"THPS 3 + 4 proves again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless and remains suitable for all skill levels...However, syncing THPS4 with the classic two-minute timer of the initial trilogy is probably going to be a sore point with fans who strongly regard the series’ fourth installment as their favourite, and discarding a whopping 80% of the original THPS3 and THPS4 soundtracks is a startlingly naive choice to make about such a famously crucial component of those games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gamingtrend.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review-spine-transfer-into-a-new-old-format/">GamingTrend</a> awarded it <strong>85/100</strong>, noting how it doesn't nail it "perfectly" but it's still a lot of fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 lands somewhere between remake and reimagining. It doesn’t land either perfectly, but it's still a ton of fun. There’s a lot to see and do"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/07/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-review/">But Why Tho?</a> gave it <strong>9/10</strong>, mentioning how it breathes new life into this classic series once again but seemingly wasn't impacted by the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The skating itself is the best it has ever been. <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and 4</em> is even smoother and more refined than its predecessor, making the skating action as lifelike as possible. Landing tricks feel fluid, and although it takes a while to master, it is pretty simple to pick up and play. There are special tricks that can be unlocked and assigned to skaters as well, scoring significantly more points than your average trick."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4/skating-it-safe">Game Informer</a> gave the Birdman's new game <strong>8/10</strong>, but left it wanting a little more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Iron Galaxy has excellently modernized the gameplay and graphics of these classics to feel right in 2025, I wish it had done a better job of highlighting the influence these games once had in their heyday."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems <a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/71640/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-switch-2-review">Nintendo World Report</a> has also got access to the Switch 2 version and while there are said to be some "technical issues on Switch 2" it was still happy to award this version <strong>9/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While online on Switch 2 ran great in my experience, the same can’t be said for overall stability. Visually everything looks fine docked and on handheld, but the game crashed back to the console’s home screen close to 10 times over my 20+ hours of gameplay...even if there’s a decent chance these issues get resolved, as it stands, it’s shaky right now."</p>
</blockquote>
