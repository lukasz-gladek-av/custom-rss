<p>Primarily, the unlocked frame rate rarely manages to hit that 60fps sweet spot, resulting in some horrible stuttering that's far more prevalent in docked mode thanks to the VRR technology in handheld mode. Thankfully, developer IO Interactive is aware and is looking to address these issues very soon.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3wjklvg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>, IO is hoping to issue a fix for the performance issues "over the Summer". Bit of a vague timescale, we're sure you'll agree, but it gives the dev some wiggle room if it needs a bit of extra time. It didn't elaborate on exactly what the fix would entail, but a spokesperson said that "the team is working on some of those performance issues right now", suggesting that the frame rate issue specifically would be high up on the team's list of priorities.</p>
<p>It also stated that these learnings would be applied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, which is scheduled to launch on Switch 2 in 2026. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/007-first-light-official-game-reveal-launching-on-switch-2-in-2026">official announcement</a> for the game arrived last month, with a full gameplay reveal scheduled to take place this Summer.</p>
<p>Whatever comes from the planned update, we're excited to see what kind of improvements it brings. We don't know about you, but we're eager to dive back into Hitman: World of Assassination. The only thing holding us back right now is that darn frame rate.</p>

<p>Well, that escalated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Repair firm iFixit has performed a full teardown of the Switch 2's Pro Controller, delivering a scathing review of the repairability and potential durability of the accessory. Ultimately, it calls the Pro Controller a "p**s-poor excuse for a controller".</p>
<p>But why? Well, watching the video reveals just how tricky it is to actually get into the Pro Controller, with Nintendo applying adhesives to the front faceplate, lots of hidden screws, and thumb-grips that need "an uncomfortable amount of force to remove". Essentially, iFixit believes that the work required to simply reach the controller's battery for potential replacement is far too difficult for the average consumer.</p>
<p>Then, of course, we have the potential issue of stick drift. iFixit believes the potentiometer stick technology used in the Switch 2's Pro Controller means it will likely still be prone to drifting. That said, it says that the sticks themselves are slightly easier to remove than that of the original Switch Pro Controller.</p>
<p>As for the good news (if you can call it good news), the headphone jack is fully modular and easily removable. In fact, iFixit says that this is probably the only positive that it can muster when it comes to assessing the Pro Controller.</p>
<p>In conclusion, iFixit points to cheaper controllers such as the <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1443193.html">Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit</a> as accessories that accomplish much more at a lower price, including the additions of TMR and Hall Effect sticks.</p>
<p>Now, in practice, the Pro Controller for the Switch 2 is astoundingly comfortable to use, with excellent-feeling sticks and a strong d-pad. However, as time goes on and more folks find the need to repair their controllers, it seems Nintendo has made it about as difficult as possible to actually get into the bloomin' things.</p>

<p>With Switch 2 now hosting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur</a> and the like, have you got a case of GameCube fever? If so, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/misc_a_tiny_tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a> might be just the soothing ointment you need to apply generously all over your body. Lead developer Michael Pearce has said it was inspired by the games of his youth, and it only takes a glance at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/misc-a-tiny-tale-will-fill-the-chibi-robo-sized-hole-in-your-heart-this-july">the trailer</a> to see that those games must surely have included GameCube favourites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo!</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. Taking that retro inspiration, Misc is a 3D platformer featuring a teeny-weeny robot bobbling about and helping people in a quirky post-human world.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157199/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The debut release from Tinyware Games, Misc was made by a core team of three, winning funding from the Australian government along the way. It was developed for Nintendo Switch (which is the version reviewed here) and PC but, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/misc-a-tiny-tale-looks-super-smooth-on-switch-2-thanks-to-a-dev-hunch">as reported on Nintendo Life last month</a>, Tinyware took a punt on Switch 2’s approach to backwards compatibility, meaning the new console does deliver a significant boost in graphics and performance – but more on that later.</p>
<p>The story revolves around an inch-tall robot named Buddy and his friend Bag Boy – a unicycle robot with a paper bag on his head. One day, they hear an explosion in their little garden village, then set out on an adventure to find out what it was. As they go, they visit other locales peppered with friendly robo-characters to lend a hand to, run errands for, or trade with.</p>
<p>As simple as the story is, it’s nice to go on a quest just because something went bang, not because the world’s ending again – and it doesn’t hold back on throwing in some dramatic moments later on. This is supported well by the music, which has a storybook quality, some eerie moments, and even a few songs for the emotional peaks.</p>
<p>Each village area you visit on Buddy’s odyssey has a locked exit gate and a scattering of collectibles. There’s not too many — no collectathon trinket fixation here — and they’re split between major golden cogs and minor metal nuts. The metal nuts are more plentiful, left in short trails to nudge you around the level, while the golden cogs are the keys to opening the gates. Each area has ten cogs, with eight required for progression. A little icing on that quite appetising collectibles cake is a feel-good "Difference Made" system (think Chibi-Robo’s Happy Points) which counts up your positive influence on the world as you potter about litter-picking and scrubbing goop.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157254/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But collecting golden cogs is the backbone of the game. You mainly get them either by completing tasks for NPCs — find a shiny trinket or complete a set of sheet music — or by performing daring feats of platforming and exploration. The platforming is all low-stakes stuff — there are no lives to lose or anything like that — but when you fall, you will be left having to retrace your steps, which can sometimes be a bit of a downer.</p>
<p>Alongside some retrying, the jump-feel takes a bit of getting used to. It’s floaty by design, with Buddy having a propeller on his head to extend his air time, and the camera will need plenty of manual nudging to get sight of both where you’re aiming and where your drop shadow’s going. It was a good decision on Tinyware’s part to put the most challenging jumping in separate underground sections — one on each level — without any golden cogs riding on it. Tucking the 'real' platforming away in break-outs like this reminded me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>’s wooden-block courses – another GameCube reminiscence.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157251/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While we’re on the subject of controls, there are duck and dive manoeuvres that are almost never needed, as if they’d been forgotten, and a stamina gauge to throttle your sprinting that just seemed unnecessary to me. Misc does control well once you’ve clicked with it, but these details make it feel just a little bit baggy.</p>
<p>Most of the action happens in outdoor settings a bit reminiscent of Pikmin. However, a graphical comparison with Switch contemporary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> is not <em>especially</em> flattering. The environments are varied, particularly later in the game, although they sometimes seem a little barren. While most levels don’t feel like places characters might actually live, their charm and creativity still come through.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Switch isn’t doing the game any favours: it simply can’t render the game at its best. Resolution is low, and distant assets are hard to make out, with a lot of shimmering. The default setting for focus blur is a little heavy-handed — not so much Vaseline on the lens as a custard pie — obscuring anything at a distance and making it hard to get your bearings. Once I discovered I could turn the blur off, it didn’t go back on – for simple playability more than aesthetics.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157253/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And that little bit of navigation help was really needed in some villages. I eventually managed to frame the levels around distinctive landmarks, but scouring places for the last couple of cogs sometimes led to walking — albeit rather cutely — in circles. As I climbed up the same stack of buckets for the fourteenth time, even Bag Boy starting giving me funny looks. Add some invisible walls and blocked gaps that look like you could go through them, and more than once I was ready to move on before having the required cogs.</p>
<p>A test on Switch 2 told a different story altogether. The resolution at distance is great, movement is much smoother, and load times are shorter. I still preferred to have the blur turned off, but the ability to survey levels properly from high vantage points helped no end in finding my way around. Again, though, it’s the Switch 1 'version' under review here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Misc. A Tiny Tale is a charming and delightful first effort from Tinyware – albeit with some wobbles in execution. It sticks very close to classic ideas and struggles with graphical fidelity on Switch, but none of that can undo the charm of the characters and the retro vibe straight from the GameCube era. Until Chibi-Robo hits Nintendo Classics, this will serve all your miniature robot helper needs.</p></section>
