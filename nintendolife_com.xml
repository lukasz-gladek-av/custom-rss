<p>Based on real dreams?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Mexican indie studio Interactive Dreams has announced that its short interactive story, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/a_dream_about_parking_lots">A Dream About Parking Lots</a>, arrives on Nintendo Switch... today.</p>
<p>The game, which only takes around 30-40 minutes to complete according to the PR, sees you search for your car, whilst at the same time having a conversation with a therapist about why you have this recurring dream about parking lots.</p>
<p>It may be short, but when indies hone in on something mighty specific in a laser-focused way like this â€” and especially when the writing is up to scratch â€” special things can occur. And, given this one is currently sat on a "Positive" user rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3500340/A_Dream_About_Parking_Lots/">over on Steam</a>, where it released back in March, it seems it might pack some big messages into its short running time.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer above, and here's some more from the PR blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Dream About Parking Lots</em> is a short, surreal narrative game where you search for your car in endless parking lots while talking to your therapist about recurring dreams. Blending retro visuals with emotional storytelling, it explores themes of feeling lost, creative block, and the strange logic of dreams ðŸ§ </p>
<p>Look for your car by using your car key!<br>
30-40 minutes long.<br>
Retro-style graphics.<br>
Existential story about feeling lost and creative blocks.<br>
Based on real dreams!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can't find details on pricing, as it's not yet showing up on the eShop, but it's $3.99 on <a href="https://interactivedreams.itch.io/adreamaboutparkinglots">itch.io</a> and Steam. It's 699 yen <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000101018">on the Japanese eShop</a>, although there's a 20% launch discount right now that brings it down to 559 yen.</p>
<p><em>Looking forward to having therapy in a car park that may or may not exist?</em></p>

<p>Button mashing is smashing, especially with friends</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've known for a while now, and as reported by our sister site Time Extension <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/taitos-track-and-field-esque-arcade-game-field-day-is-heading-to-ps4-and-switch-this-month">a week back</a>, Taito's 1984 classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arcade_archives_field_day">Field Day</a>, is on its way to Nintendo Switch consoles as part of the Arcade Archives series.</p>
<p>Now, Hamster has announced that the game will officially release on 31st July. Which is today. Holy timely news piece, Batman.</p>
<p>Field Day was amongst a whole crop of a very particular style of button-mashy sports game that popped up in the mid-'80s, mostly off the back of the enormous success of Konami's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_track_and_field">Track and Field</a>. This very writer whiled away copious hours playing most of them on his trusty Commodore 64, so can therefore confirm that the whole thing becomes very addictive if you let it get to you. These were as good as games looked back at the time, too, especially on home computers.</p>
<p>Of course, where Track and Field had regular sports games in a regular stadium sort of scenario, in this one you are taking part in a raft of challenges at a girl's school - stuff like tug-of-war, hence the name Field Day, which is like a Sports Day, right? Right?</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat antiquated look of this one, you must understand â€” and especially if you've never tried any of these sorts of games â€” that adding a second human player can lead to a category-10-level time sink. We're talking extinction-level event here. Well, not really. It does get bloody competitive, mind.</p>
<p>Also, some experts (or boffins, if you want) reckon this effort is actually more challenging than Track and Field, given its slightly odder collection of events. Here's some further details from Hamster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"FIELD DAY" is an action game released by TAITO in 1984.<br>
Players compete in a variety of seven non-conventional sporting events from three-legged race to tug-of-war in an effort to become the sports day champion.<br>
Each event features a qualifying score which must be met to progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Field Day releases today and costs Â£6.29/$7.99/â‚¬6.99</p>

<p>Here's a look</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has been out for a few weeks now, and unsurprisingly, players are still discovering all sorts of things about it.</p>
<p>Apart from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/random-donkey-kong-bananza-players-are-already-skipping-layers-and-transformations">new ways to speedrun the game</a>, as you've probably noticed, there's some lovely attention to detail, and it extends to DK's fur. <a href="http://suppermariobroth.com/">Supper Mario Broth</a> on social media notes how a full "Bananergy" meter will actually make DK's fur "slightly brighter".</p>
<p>Here's the post in full, along with a bit of extra detail about how exactly it works:</p>

<p>We've had a closer look at this ourselves and have taken multiple before-and-after shots in one of the layers with better lighting:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4kxztop&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
