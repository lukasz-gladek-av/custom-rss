            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Acclaimed indie developer Simogo is celebrating its 15th birthday today, but it feels like we're the one getting presents. Fans of the Swedish studio are going to be thrilled with the projects the team has revealed, so buckle up.</p>
<p>First up (thanks, <a href="https://vgc.news/news/simogo-reveals-7-game-collection-for-switch-and-pc-confirms-sayonara-wild-hearts-for-switch-2/">VGC</a>!) are Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sayonara-wild-hearts-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, two of our favourite games on the Switch. Sharper visuals and frames are likely part of these packages, and we only have to wait until <strong>early next year</strong> to try them out. No upgrade path has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Second, we have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December 2025</strong>. This is a compilation of the studio's first seven titles <em>and</em> a whole host of bonus content which, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/simogo-legacy-collection-announced-for-switch-2-switch-and-pc">Gematsu</a> highlights, including an E-book, an audio drama podcast, unreleased music and art, and a handful of playable prototypes.</p>
<p>All the games in this collection were originally released on iOS, and while some did come to Wii U, most of these have never seen a console release. Simogo actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-dev-teases-switch-port-of-critically-acclaimed-text-adventure">teased one of these earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kosmo Spin</strong> (2010) - a circular arcade game where you're trying to save a planet full of breakfast cereal</li>
<li><strong>Bumpy Road</strong> (2011) - a road trip adventure where you control the road and not the car</li>
<li><strong>Beat Sneak Bandit</strong> (2012) - a rhythmic-based puzzler where you need to sneak inside the mansion to win</li>
<li><strong>Year Walk</strong> (2013) - a first-person adventure based on the Swedish tradition of årsgång, "year walking"</li>
<li><strong>DEVICE 6</strong> (2013) - a text-based puzzler where you guide a woman through an island who doesn't remember getting there</li>
<li><strong>The Sailor's Dream</strong> (2014) - a narrative adventure that changes based on the real-world clock</li>
<li><strong>SPL-T</strong> (2015) <em>-</em> a block-splitting puzzler</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, but by no means least, Simogo has teamed up with the lovely folks at Lost in Cult for <strong><a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">Heartbeats, Dreams and Laser Eyes: 15 Years of Simogo</a></strong>, a stunning book covering the studio's history, philosophy, and inspirations.</p>

<p>Essays from writers Holly Nielsen, Christian Donlan, Nadia Oxford and Aaron Riccio will dive deep into the studio's projects and games, and the book as a whole promises to "provide readers with a deeper understanding of one of the most consistently inventive studios in the business."</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition will be available for a limited time and it'll cost <strong>£69.99</strong> (the standard edition is much cheaper at <strong>£39.99</strong>) — the first 300 copies will come with a signed bookplate from co-founders Simon Flesser and Magnus 'Gordon' Gardebäck. Check out the <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">website for more details</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that's a darn good slate; every single game Simogo has released will be on Switch 1 <em>and</em> Switch 2 come early next year. Plus that book is tasty.</p>
<p>If you haven't played either Lorelei or Sayonara Wild Hearts, what are you <em>doing?</em> Okay, we get it, lots of games — check out our reviews for both (below) if you're curious.</p>

<p>Okay, so, look, I wasn't <em>trying</em> to do a heist. This is all a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p>See, the Louvre is mostly known for its paintings, statues, stealing art from other countries, and being hard to pronounce for anyone who doesn't have a French tongue. (<em>Loov. Looooov-ruh. Loovuhrrr. Loovurhrh.</em> Never mind.) Also, that one really famous, wildly underwhelming picture of the lady with the mystic smile.</p>
<p>But that's not what I care about when it comes to the Louvre. The Parisian pyramid is the only museum in the world that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/12/hands_on_nintendo_3ds_guide_louvre">used 3DSes as their audio guides</a>, and I've never had the chance to try them! And then, tragically, when the museum <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/louvre-says-au-revoir-to-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides">discontinued them earlier this year</a>, I thought to myself, 'Well, what are they going to do with all those 3DSes? Put them into the archive, like all the rejected paintings that don't draw a big enough crowd? I won't stand for it.'</p>
<figure data-uuid="e729831c85fd3"><a title="Louvre Guide on 3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e729831c85fd3/louvre-guide-on-3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I was going to nab a copy of the game, too — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, I went to visit the museum. Just a normal visit, you understand! And yes, I went in through a first-floor window via a ladder, but that wasn't because I was planning to steal things! I just wanted to beat the crowds. And avoid the entry cost. I mean, €25 to walk very slowly through a crowd taking selfies with the Mona Lisa? That's the real robbery here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>€25 to walk very slowly through a crowd taking selfies with the Mona Lisa? That's the real robbery here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was fully my intention to walk over to the information desk, politely ask about the 3DSes, and whether a caring patron of the arts such as myself could make a donation to the museum in order to take one home, and then once they'd handed me a big box of 3DSes, I would leave down my special museum ladder.</p>
<p>But once I was in, well, the crown jewels were just <em>sitting there</em>. I thought to myself, 'You can buy a <em>lot</em> of 3DSes with crown jewels money. Maybe you could even afford a single secondhand copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver</a> from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/playing-the-cex-retro-lottery">CeX</a>!'</p>
<p>Besides, I had a very capacious tote bag with me.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was slowly trundling down the ladder back to the streets of Paris that I even realised that I'd done a heist, or that no sane person on eBay is going to buy <em>obviously stolen</em> crown jewels.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with no 3DSes and too many crown jewels, and people keep writing articles about how cool I am, despite the fact that crown jewels can't play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a>.</p>
<p>Look, I wrote up a comparison:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>3DS</th>
<th>Crown Jewels</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>✅ Comes in many colours</td>
<td>❌ Comes in factory colours only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Take it anywhere</td>
<td>❌ Can only be taken to state occasions or maybe a fancy party</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Customisable home menu themes</td>
<td>❌ No home menu themes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ StreetPass!</td>
<td>❌ No StreetPass</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Playable in 2D and 3D</td>
<td>❌ No 2D option</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Can play cult classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</a></td>
<td>❌ Cannot play cult classic Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the obvious winner is the 3DS. It's not even close. And sure, the Crown Jewels make for some very nice hats, but I don't even <em>want</em> hats. I want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/pullblox">Pullblox</a>, on a commuter train, with the option to make my eyes feel like they're being peeled from the inside!</p>
<p>Crown Jewels don't even have expandable SD card storage, so even if I <em>wanted</em> to take them to fancy parties or state occasions, I'd have to bring a separate external hard drive with me for all my games. Who wants to bring an external hard drive to a masquerade ball, or the coronation of the new monarch? Not me. It's very unfashionable.</p>

<p>But all is not lost. I have, in fact, started to melt down a couple of the pieces, because I have an amazing idea. I may not have a Louvre 3DS, but I do have a <em>normal</em> 3DS, and it's one of the 'New' ones with swappable faceplates. I've had mine protected by an understated Triforce-pattern plate for a long, long time, so I think I've earned a little glitz and glamour, haven't I?</p>
<p>It turns out that gluing 10-carat emeralds to a bit of plastic is a <em>little</em> difficult, but it's worth it. I feel like a queen, if queens knew what autostereoscopic handheld video game consoles were. It does make the thing bloody heavy, though.</p>
<p>Oh, and hopefully it goes without saying, but please don't tell anyone that I did the heist, okay? I really, really don't want to go to French prison. Or any kind of prison, really. I don't think they let you keep your 3DSes when you're incarcerated. Thanks.</p>
