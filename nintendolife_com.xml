<figure><a title="Pokemon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab368ab488c3a/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: via Serebii.net / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been an exciting week on the Pokémon front with multiple new announcements shared in the recent broadcast. Following this, more details about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> physical and digital pre-order goodies in select regions have been surfacing online.</p>
<p>Now, we've got an update about one of the special items trainers located in Japan and Australia can get their hands on as a pre-order bonus. As highlighted by Serebii.net, it's a trench coat customisation and will be available "at certain locations" – including Amazon in Japan and from EB Games in Australia.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The same source also notes how this bonus will be distributed as a "serial code to redeem" but has no further details about additional distributions elsewhere. So, if you do decide to pre-order, you'll be able to look the part with this stylish and exclusive fit as you make your way around Lumiose City.</p>
<p>This again follows The Pokémon Company and Nintendo announcing a new Switch 2 hardware bundle this week as well as multiple pre-order deals. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-and-switch-pre-order-bonuses-revealed-us">some other digital distribution pre-order offers</a>, and these particular ones are available worldwide.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumours about a Nintendo Direct</a> already doing the rounds online, veteran video game journalist Christopher Dring has now added to this buzz, claiming "Xbox is expected to announce more game ports" for other platforms, including the Switch 2, in the "coming weeks" (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-apparently-announce-more-ps5-and-switch-2-ports-in-the-coming-weeks">thanks, Pure Xbox</a>).</p>

<p>While it's not known what exactly we might be seeing on the Switch 2 from Xbox, there's already been a lot of rumours about key series potentially being ported.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> team has recently responded to a question from <a href="https://youtu.be/o5tOD0sqfKM?t=1050">Gamertag Radio</a> about the game's sequel potentially getting a Switch 2 release at some point, and it sounds open to the idea of it – mentioning how it wants "as many people to be able to play" as possible (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51091-obsidian-says-we-ll-see-what-happens-in-regards-to-grounded-2-on-switch-2">via GoNintendo</a>).</p>

<p>Joining the fight on Switch platforms later this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Marvel's been involved with some pretty exciting games in recent times, and hopefully, this trend continues with its upcoming arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on the Switch and Switch 2 later this year, Dotemu has today revealed another two playable characters joining the roster. This time we get a brief look at 'Beta Ray Bill' and 'Silver Surfer' who join the fight against the immortal super villain Annihilus.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about the latest character reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hammer time for Annihilus’ forces when Beta Ray Bill smashes into action! With his devastating and mighty hammer known as Stormbreaker, the son of Korbin marshals his cyborg strength to squash any bug battalion standing in his way!</p>
<p>And he won’t be joining the fight alone – from the depths of the cosmos, the Silver Surfer soars into the battle! Imbued with the Power Cosmic, the Surfer can stun any adversary. Easily gliding in the skies or close to the ground, insectoid invaders can’t escape Galactus’ former herald!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill will join a cast made up of various other characters like Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Venom and She-Hulk, as they brawl their way through the streets of Marvel's New York, all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone.</p>

<p>Fans voice their frustrations online</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03dfc2db8ed2c/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> has finally landed on the Switch 2 this week, and while the experience was expected to match other versions of the game, it seems this isn't <em>entirely</em> the case.</p>
<p>Although community creations are available in the Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-lacks-image-uploading-on-switch-2-and-fans-arent-happy">as highlighted by IGN</a>, this version "lacks image uploading" and it appears to have caught some wrestling enthusiasts by surprise.</p>
<p>The official game FAQ actually goes into a bit more detail about these restrictions, noting how Switch 2 players won't be able to upload or view custom images from "other platforms". The <a href="https://support.wwe2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/42408597808019-WWE-2K-Image-Uploader-Tool">same page on the game website</a> also includes the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 players will not see Image Uploader based Community Creations from any platform or be able to upload their own"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see below, fans and content creators within this space have shared their frustrations online – with some already speculating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1m6lovh/no_community_creations_in_nintendo_switch_2/">about the reasons behind this decision</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51086-wwe-2k25-on-switch-2-blocks-access-to-user-created-content">GoNintendo</a> have also labelled this a "major disappointment" and have reached out to multiple parties to "try and get an answer".</p>

<p>Apart from this, early impressions suggest <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64/status/1948093777320546314">the Switch 2 version of WWE 2K25 is a respectable port</a>. We'll be delivering our Nintendo Life review soon, and if we hear any significant developments tied to this story, we'll let you know.</p></section>
