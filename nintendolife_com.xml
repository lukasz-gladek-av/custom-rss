<p>Ahead of EVO 2025 later this week, Arc System Works has finally shared an update about the Switch version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a>, which was released at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Following a previous update, the development team has now confirmed the DLC characters Venom, Unika and Lucy will be made available for the Switch in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>. This version of the game is also expected to bring the Nintendo version "up to speed with the latest version".</p>
<p>This includes balance adjustments, ranked matches, and also plans to address some text issues. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>Guilty Gear Strive Nintendo Switch Edition Update (Fall 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the long wait regarding the update for Guilty Gear -Strive- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Venom and Unika, along with Lucy, are planned for an update in the Fall of 2025.<br>
Development for the Nintendo Switch Edition involves porting the character after completion, followed by sequential optimization and processing load reduction.</p>
<p>The Fall 2025 update is expected to bring it up to speed with the latest version, including not only playable character additions but also Digital Figures, balance adjustments, and Ranked Matches. Additionally, we are addressing issues where text is difficult to read in some language settings. Please look forward to the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows multiple DLC character updates for other platforms. The Switch version of the game includes 28 playable characters in the base package, including the first three seasons of the title.</p>

<p>Unlock a new theme next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>DK is back in his latest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and apart from new merch and promotions in mobile games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, he's also getting his very own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> event.</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo's Switch Online-focused battle-royale <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/tetris">Tetris</a> game will be hosting a special event between <strong>1st - 4th August, 2025</strong>. In this limited-time Maximus Cup, you'll be able to unlock a theme including special art, music and Tetrimino designs once you've accumulated 100 event points.</p>
<p>This event marks the 48th Maximus Cup event. If you haven't played Donkey Kong Bananza yet, you can check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest update for Tetris 99 follows a Maximus Cup in June, which saw the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/tetris-99s-new-maximus-cup-sees-the-return-of-four-nintendo-themes">four Nintendo themes</a>.</p>
