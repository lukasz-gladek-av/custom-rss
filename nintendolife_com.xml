<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/299d8a1b1cd6e/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier today, Nintendo dropped a surprise on everyone by revealing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>'s release date <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">on the Nintendo Today! app</a>. And now, a few hours later, pre-orders are open — and that means the price has been revealed, too.</p>
<p>You can snap up the digital-only wheelchair basketball game for just <strong>$19.99 USD / GBP £16.99</strong>, which is a pretty bargain price all things considered. Many didn't expect the game to retail at a high price given its premise, but it's good to have confirmation.</p>
<p>You can snap up those pre-orders on the eShop right now; here are links to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/drag-x-drive-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html">the UK one</a>.</p>

<p>Described as "the next generation of 3-on-3 sports" by the Big N, Drag x Drive takes full advantage of the Joy-Con 2's Mouse controls. It's playable <em>only</em> with them, meaning you'll need to have the best coordination to become a master. At least, from our experience trying it out.</p>
<p>On 14th August, you'll be able to find out for yourself whether you're the king of the courts.</p>
<p><em>Let us know whether you'll be picking up Drag x Drive in the comments</em>.</p>
