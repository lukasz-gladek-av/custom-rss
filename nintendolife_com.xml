<p>Originally released in 2023, System Shock is a comprehensive yet faithful remake of the 1994 FPS from Looking Light Studios. Development was lengthy and somewhat troubled, with Nightdive striving to reboot the original with more modern design principles.</p>
<p>In the end, however, to deliver on the promises of its initial Kickstarter campaign, the team chose to lean more towards a remake, keeping the core elements of the original intact while introducing a plethora of quality-of-life updates.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pmgzwx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Ultimately, Nightdive succeeded in its goal, and System Shock received mostly positive critical acclaim upon release. Taking place in the year 2072, you play as an unnamed hacker who awakens in a station under total control of SHODAN, an AI completely removed from its moral and ethical restraints. Grotesque mutations and cyborgs roam the station, and it's up to you to defeat SHODAN.</p>
<p>With visuals blending pixel art textures and modern lighting technology, the System Shock remake is, to put it lightly, a <em>vibe</em>. It's a significantly different experience compared to System Shock 2, which Nightdive also released on the Switch earlier this year. If you're curious, we definitely recommend giving it a shot. For those on Switch 2, the game will offer up both gyro aiming and optional mouse controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Unravel the chilling story of SHODAN's rise and explore the mysteries of Citadel Station, piecing together the truth in this atmospheric sci-fi world</p>
<p>- Face perilous traps, puzzles, and a legion of hostile and mutated creatures — created and controlled by the villainous SHODAN herself</p>
<p>- Choose between a male or female-presenting Hacker protagonist</p>
<p>- Improved gyro aiming and Joy-Con 2 mouse support adds gameplay versatility for both controller and mouse and keyboard players</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's no secret that some of the greatest minds in Japanese game development like to get together to break bread (or knock back a beer or two), but this particular meeting is especially impressive. Here, we've got the aforementioned Suda51 with none other than Masahiro Sakurai (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros.

<p>Just imagine the kinds of conversations these guys have while sipping back a few beverages! It's enough to make us extremely jealous. How we'd love to be a fly on the wall at these get togethers...</p>
<p>For Sakurai in particular, this will no doubt be one of few instances in which the creator has actually taken some time away from his busy schedule. In addition to creating Kirby Air Riders for the Switch 2, Sakurai also produced dozens of YouTube videos focused on the art of creating games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mikami is hard at work at his new development studio Kamuy Inc., Ueda is working on the untitled 'Project Robot' game, and Suda51 is putting the finishing touches on the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c8fd6d87e84de"><a title="Harada leaves Bandai Namco" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8fd6d87e84de/harada-leaves-bandai-namco.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN">Katsuhiro Harada</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Katsuhiro Harada, the executive producer and director of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken</a> franchise — a man often referred to as a father of sorts to all things Tekken — has announced via social media that he'll be stepping down from his role at Bandai Namco, and therefore from involvement in the series, at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The legendary director (and voice of Law and Yoshimitsu, not to mention a few others, on some of the earlier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tekken_3d_prime_edition">Tekken</a> entries) says he's timing his departure to fit in with the 30th anniversary of this most beloved of fighting franchises.</p>

<p>Harada's post was also shared by <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178">the official Tekken X account</a>, which added a few pertinent details, lest fans get a little concerned. The post states that the departure won't affect DLC plans or future updates/plans for Tekken 8 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tekken-8-on-switch-2-would-be-a-lot-of-work-but-director-isnt-ruling-it-out">when are we getting that on Switch 2, eh?</a>) and the franchise at large, whilst also wishing Harada well, and pointing out that he'll make an appearance at the Tekken World Tour 2025 finals in Sweden at the end of January.</p>
<p>In a lengthy and very personal message, Harada also described his roots and reasons for moving on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</p>
With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.
<p>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centers overseas.<br>
I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to “Please try TEKKEN,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.<br>
The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.<br>
And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.<br>
Those memories are also deeply precious to me.<br>
In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.<br>
Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”<br>
During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.<br>
His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p>
<p>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.<br>
Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.<br>
Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.<br>
To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.<br>
I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.<br>
Thank you very much for everything.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>【Postscript】<br>
Although I will be leaving the company at the end of 2025, Bandai Namco has asked me to appear at the TWT Finals at the end of January 2026, so I expect to attend as a guest.</p>
<p>For 30 years I kept saying, “I’ll do it someday,” and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event.<br>
So instead, I will be releasing—for the first and last time—a 60-minute TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement.<br>
Listening to it brings back many memories.<br>
Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years.</p>

<p>Ah, Tekken. For gamers of a certain vintage, it kinda still feels like one of the new challengers on the fighting block - as do most things that came after the cultural shock and awe of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_street_fighter_2_turbo">Street Fighter 2</a>. Harada's series brought us some of the most memorable characters outside of Capcom's huge stable of fighters, too, and the likes of Law, King and Yoshimitsu brought with them a 3D, limbs-based pugilism that feels as dazzlingly deep today as it did down the arcades in 1994.</p>
<p>Of course, and as everyone worth their salt knows, the best Tekken game on Nintendo consoles is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken Tag Tournament 2</a>, because...well, just look at it.</p>

<p>So long, Mr. Harada, all the best for the future and thanks for all the kickings!</p>

<p>A Switch Lite, but comfy!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>What do you do when you're surfing the old interwebs and happen upon a bunch of lovely gaming folk wondering if anyone has ever stuffed a Switch — in fully working order — into a Wii U GamePad (also still in complete working order)?</p>
<p>Well, if it were us, we'd shut off our internet and go for a nice, long walk outside. Maybe we'd never come back. However, (and as reported by <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/55674-modder-crams-a-switch-into-a-wii-u-gamepad">GoNintendo</a>) retro gaming YouTuber and modder extraordinaire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KouzexMods">@KouzexMods</a> accepted it as a challenge and decided it was time to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>As you can see in the impressively detailed video up top, this was no half-hearted job either. Nope, this expert retro modder has gone all in, drawing up a list of rules to stick by and everything, and it's fascinating to watch along as a Switch Lite console is stripped right down, very carefully, whilst designs are drawn up for how to have every part of the Wii U GamePad still fully functional whilst making it useable and comfortable.</p>


<p>There are even some improvements made to the base Switch console's performance during the process here, with upgrades to its battery, screen and a few other things that you can check out in the vid. Honestly, it's worth watching the full thing to see just how much effort and ingenuity went in here, and how problems met along the way were circumvented.</p>
<p>The vid wraps up with what we have to say looks like a very polished hybrid console, and muscle memory tells us that — let's face it — it's probably way more comfortable to hold than a vanilla Switch Lite. Man, that GamePad was comfortable.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Like the modding job that's been done here? Fancy turning your GamePad (if you're one of the seventy or so people who owned one) into a Switch? Let us know! (But also, don't blame us when you break it)</em></p>
