<p>Cast your minds back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> earlier this month. One of the most surprising games featured during the presentation was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tokyo-scramble">Tokyo Scramble</a>, a stealth-horror hybrid where you have to escape from dinosaur-esque creatures. And you can do so alone or with the help of friends via GameChat and GameShare.</p>
<p>Not only was the announcement a surprise, but so was the release date — 11th February 2026, just less than a week after the Direct. Well, that's cool! Plus, the game was developed by one of the co-devs of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia</a>. Sounds interesting, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just a week after release, it seems like people aren't <em>too</em> hot on the game. We haven't managed to check it out ourselves, but looking at reviews and discussion online, opinions range to "a neat experiment" to "campy" to "very rough".</p>
<p>With only three critic reviews <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tokyo-scramble/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">on Metacritic</a> — all of which score the game at 5 or below — and an average score of <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20062/tokyo-scramble/reviews">37 on OpenCritic</a> (after 11 reviews), Tokyo Scramble's big reveal doesn't seem to have paid off.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://monstervine.com/2026/02/tokyo-scramble-review/">Monster Vine's Spencer Legacy's thoughts</a> on the main gameplay element, for example: "The stealth mechanics that serve as the very core of Tokyo Scramble are more irritating than compelling, especially since you die in a single hit." Technical issues and poor writing hampered what was otherwise a game with "some neat ideas", with the outlet landing on a 2/5 score.</p>
<p><a href="https://noisypixel.net/tokyo-scramble-review/">Azario Lopez over at Noisy Pixel</a> similarly sees the potential, but says Tokyo Scramble takes the "campy moments... too far". Again, mechanics, gameplay, and visual issues hinder the experience a lot, with Lopez concluding: "I respect the ambition behind trying something strange and new, especially for a fresh IP, but ambition alone doesn’t carry a game this far", scoring it a 4/10.</p>
<p>It's not <em>all</em> bad, of course; <a href="https://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2026/02/analise-tokyo-scramble-sobrevivencia-e-drama.html">Fernando Lorde at Brazilian outlet Nintendo Blast</a> awarded the game a 7/10, praising that ambition, while acknowledging that (translated via Google): "it feels like a melting pot of ideas and mechanics lost in a feverish teenage dream about relationships and subterranean monsters."</p>
<p>Outside of reviews and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualnintendo/comments/1r23fnb/so_i_bought_tokyo_scramble/">odd Reddit thread</a> about the game, online chatter seems pretty muted about the game overall. But the consensus seems to be that Tokyo Scramble is a swing and a miss for most, though if you like campy, ambitious experiences, you might find something to love.</p>

<p>Of course, we're just going by what others have said, so we'd love to hear from any of you lovely readers who have actually played the game — or are even a little bit interested in it! Do you think Tokyo Scramble is a misunderstood gem? Perhaps the camp and clunk have won you over? Or are you disappointed you jumped in head-first?</p>
