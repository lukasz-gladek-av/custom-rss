<p>"Increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/37a6d0938a306/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following three updates in June, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s first (and probably last) update for July 2025 is now live.</p>
<p>This might just be the biggest one yet, as it includes a whole bunch of general updates as well as multiple bug fixes. One, in particular, mentions how the frequency of "lap-type courses" has been increased. Another note mentions how the computer opponents have been made "weaker in everything other than Battle" mode.</p>
<p>There's much more alongside these adjustments, so here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World: Ver. 1.2.0 (Released July 29, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li>
<li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li>
<li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.
<ul>
<li>If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.</li>
<li>Made COM weaker in everything other than “Battle”.</li>
<li>Made homing of Boomerang weaker.</li>
<li>Decreased the probability of getting a Triple Dash Mushroom in the low position, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Changed it so order of getting ? Block is higher than in the past, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Made it so there is a wheel spinning animation if the player presses the A button (acceleration) too early when starting a race while driving.
<ul>
<li>Player will not lose speed even when spinning wheels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in “VS Race” and wireless races.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<figure><a title="Fall Guys" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d86780b897dca/fall-guys.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mediatonic, Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Games are already benefitting in all sorts of ways from the Switch 2's upgrades, and with this in mind, Mediatonic's free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a> has now been updated for the new hybrid platform.</p>
<p>In this update, the battle-royale style game has apparently received an "improvement" on Switch 2 in the form of "uncapped" frame rates, allowing it to run at "up to" 60FPS. Here are the official patch notes via the official developer post on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPROVEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>"We have uncapped FPS on Nintendo Switch 2, allowing the game to run on up to 60 FPS on that platform."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part of the 'Tropical Tides' update, so if you're still playing this one, you can update your game now to receive the update. If you haven't played it before, you'll need an Epic account to participate in the cross-platform multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>This title originally made its debut on the Switch eShop in 2022. At the time, we scored it seven out of ten, calling it "chaotic fun" despite the choppy frame rate on the original Switch.</p>

<figure><a title="Lost in Cult Animal Well" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77fe1c1476def/lost-in-cult-animal-well.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Derek Yu / Lost In Cult</em></figcaption></figure><p>2024's hit puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_well">Animal Well</a> is getting a second physical edition, this time from Lost In Cult, and it's absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>After announcing an artbook earlier this year, Lost In Cult has lifted the lid on two lovely little physicals on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/toadsanime.lostincult.co.uk/post/3lv4lutgv3f2y">social media</a> — one standard edition, and one exclusive edition designed by <strong>UFO 50</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a> creator Derek Yu. Both versions cost <strong>£29.99</strong> and will be shipping in Q4 2025.</p>
<p>The physical version will come with all recent patches on the cartridge, including the brand new Switch 2 compatibility update.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4aGvRTLyifg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f17ajoywsr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGvRTLyifg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>We love the art for <em>both</em> versions, to be honest — the clay animal statues on the general release are adorable and creepy, while Derek Yu's artwork is charming and manages to capture the limited neon colourscape of the game.</p>
<p>This is the second physical release for Shared Memory's acclaimed game following <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/animal-well?srsltid=AfmBOop1jpU2PyPb2WWhCsw4kkSVya_J3Ij0rW6udD1NkJFrbsyRXAL6">Limited Run Games' release last year</a>. So, if you missed out on that one, well, this one looks a little more unique!</p>
