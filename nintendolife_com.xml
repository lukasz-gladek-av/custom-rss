<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> fans will have a very Merry Christmas this year, as Sega will be launching the free 'NiGHTS DLC Pack' this week on Christmas Eve – that's <strong>24th December 2025</strong>, just to make it crystal clear.</p>
<p>The pack will include NiGHTS as a playable character, the Dream Sleeper vehicle, and new emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>The character originally appeared in <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/nights_into_dreams">NiGHTS into Dreams</a> for the Sega Saturn in 1996. The release of the DLC on Christmas Eve appears to be a direct nod to <strong>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams</strong>, a promotional sampler disc that released in the festive period of 1996.</p>
<p>There are even more free characters on the way too, with AiAi from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball</a> expected to drop in January, followed by Tangle and Whisper in February.</p>
<p>If you've purchased the additional Season Pass, you can also enjoy characters such as Spongebob Squarepants and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>'s Steve, with <strong>Pac-Man</strong> racers also expected in January.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for the Switch 2 version of CrossWorlds, we said that "Nintendo has a competitor on Switch 2 that is at the very least equal to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> if not better in certain respects". High praise indeed. It's a good'un, folks.</p>

<p>Cover up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When the Switch generation was in full swing, there were stories about games being censored in some way or form, and even blocked from being published on the eShop.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it seems fans of the "superhero comedy" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dispatch">Dispatch</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pp96i9/sigh_nintendo_has_fucking_ruined_dispatch/">have spotted a potential cover up</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dispatch-art-and-comics-pack-70050000063187-switch/">Nintendo's digital storefront in the US</a>. The banner for the "Dispatch Art and Comics Pack" DLC is showing much <em>less</em> skin compared to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/aocs/70050000063189">listings in other locations</a> (and even on other digital marketplaces <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/HP7386-PPSA27158_00-0567897799992899/">such as the PlayStation Store</a>).</p>
<p>Here's what is currently displayed on the US store. Below this, you can see the banner for the same DLC on the Nintendo store in Australia.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1d20fe2f74ba9"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1d20fe2f74ba9/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Censored artwork — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="79f3c16a242dc"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79f3c16a242dc/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Uncensored artwork — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it's got a lot of Dispatch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pp96i9/sigh_nintendo_has_fucking_ruined_dispatch/">fans questioning what's going on</a>, with some even pointing the finger at Nintendo. As this does appear to be isolated to a specific location, cases like this can sometimes be tied to local decisions, storefront regulations or classification laws. Of course, it could also be a mistake.</p>
<p>Website Notebookcheck also puts forth some ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo of America may be seeking to maintain a more family-friendly image. It’s also possible that AdHoc Studio submitted the revised digital art without the company’s insistence. Nevertheless, many gamers question why the censorship is appropriate for <em>Dispatch</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it's not the first time we've seen changes covering up characters in video games. This also doesn't necessarily mean this will carry over to the full game, but if we do hear any significant developments or findings about possible censorship in the game, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Dispatch has been rated by the ESRB as 'Mature 17+' and contains blood, crude humor, intense violence, nudity, sexual content, strong language, and use of drugs and alcohol. It's also got in-game purchases. This game launches for Switch and Switch 2 early next year on 28th January 2026.</p>

<p>Fans of Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil and more will "feel at home"</p>

<figure data-uuid="d88e9faedd8c2"><a title="Bloober Team" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d88e9faedd8c2/bloober-team.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has recently been busy with the Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a>, but did you know it's got one other mysterious Nintendo release in the pipeline?</p>
<p>In case you missed it, in July last year, the Polish-based horror developer teased it was working on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/horror-dev-bloober-team-says-its-working-on-a-new-project-for-nintendo-platforms">new project specifically for Nintendo platforms</a> known as '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/horror-dev-bloober-team-says-its-working-on-a-new-project-for-nintendo-platforms">Project M</a></strong>'. Now, in a new interview with Nintendo Insider, the studio's CEO Piotr Babieno has revealed that the first details about this title could be shared "very soon".</p>
<p>To add to this, this new game apparently has a "bold twist" which is part of a "vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware". Fans of titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>, the indie game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/limbo">Limbo</a>, and iconic video game horror series should feel right at home here. Below is the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>While the title hasn’t been announced, can you go into what players should expect from Project M, the Nintendo platform exclusive horror title from Bloober?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Piotr Babieno:</strong> "You have no idea how hard it is for me not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it. We’re confident that we’ll be able to share the first details very soon.</p>
<p>"What I can say is this: fans of <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Limbo</em>, and <em>Eternal Darkness</em> will immediately feel at home. That said, Project M introduces a bold twist—one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When details about 'Project M' originally surfaced last year, it was described as having a budget "significantly smaller" than the company's usual projects, and is a game being developed "in cooperation with the world's best creators for Nintendo platforms".</p>
<p>In the same interview, Babieno also acknowledged the "incredible" support from the team at Nintendo, mentioning how Nintendo's "trust" has guided and empowered Bloober.</p>

<p>We noted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">in our review here on Nintendo Life</a> how the "biggest drawback" of P3R when it launched in October on the new hybrid system was the 30fps performance. Thankfully, the latest update (<strong>Version 1.03</strong>) comes with <em>some</em> performance improvements.</p>
<p>Most notably, it bumps the docked version of the game up to 60fps when it's running in performance mode. The frame rate stability across the docked and handheld modes has also been improved, and Atlus notes how it will be rolling out a patch for the demo in the "coming days". Here's the full rundown:</p><div><figure data-videoid="nhkdyt-h_Eo" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnhkdyt-h_Eo" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5e7948mqyksn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<h3>Persona 3 Reload - Nintendo Switch 2 Version 1.03 Update (December 2026)</h3>
<p><strong>Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03 patch notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS</em></li>
<li><em>TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability</em></li>
<li><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 patch update for the free demo will take place in the coming days (exact time TBD)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Once again, you can find out more about Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2 in our review here on Nintendo Life, and the demo is available to download from the eShop.</p>
<p>Although we wanted more from the game's performance when we first looked at P3R on the Switch 2, we still enjoyed the overall experience, calling it an "extensive and thoughtful remake of the original and unquestionably the best way" to play this modern RPG classic.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-vince-zampella-battlefield-boss-and-call-of-duty-co-creator-killed-in-car-crash-2000655216">Kotaku</a>, EA has said "This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zampella has been working in the video game industry since the late '90s, starting off answering phones and testing games at a local game company where he lived. He then went to work for GameTek, Atari, and Panasonic Interactive Media, among other companies. Famously, Zampella was the lead designer on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/medal_of_honor_allied_assault">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> and worked on the franchise from 1999 to 2002.</p>
<p>In 2002, along with Jason West and Grant Collier, Zampella founded Infinity Ward in and began developing the now-seminal <strong>Call of Duty</strong> franchise, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_reflex">Modern Warfare</a> among the many games to receive Nintendo console ports.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_2">Modern Warfare 2</a>'s release, Zampella and West were fired from Activision (who owns Infinity Ward) and the two sued the company for wrongful termination. At the same time, they formed Respawn Entertainment and partnered with EA. West would leave in 2013, with Zampella staying on as head of the company.</p>
<p>The studio is behind some of the biggest franchises and titles on modern consoles including <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, <strong>Star Wars Jedi</strong>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. Zampella was also in charge of the LA branch of DICE (now known as Ripple Effect Studios) and was head of the <strong>Battlefield</strong> franchise.</p>
<p>We send our thoughts to Zampella's family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/vince-zampella-call-of-duty-co-creator-and-respawn-head-has-died]]></content:encoded>
