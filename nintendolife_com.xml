<p>Previous issues have been resolved</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this year, a few months after the Switch 2 launch, Nintendo identified an issue with the Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> on the new hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Now, according to Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-launches-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-search-page">Switch 2 compatibility search page</a>, the same title has received an update yesterday on <strong>11th November 2025</strong>. According to the note attached, previously identified issues have been fixed.</p>
<h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p><strong>Supported - Game behaviour is consistent with Nintendo Switch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Update 11/11/2025</em></li>
<li><em>Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The page doesn't share any specific information, but as previously reported there was an issue where the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-identifies-xenoblade-chronicles-x-voice-sync-bug-on-switch-2">voices were out of sync in some areas</a> of the title. With the game behaviour now "consistent", the Definitive Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X should work just fine on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Since the new system's launch in June, Nintendo has also released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, which made several adjustments to improve the overall gameplay on the new platform. There's currently been no mention of upgrades for the Xenoblade games, but there were some reports earlier this year of a supposed "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1jfoucs/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition_games/">hidden 60fps mode</a>" for the Definitive Edition of X. If we hear anything, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>This compatibility update follows on from Nintendo's release of new firmware for the Switch 2 yesterday, bumping the system up to Version 21.0.0. You can find out more in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">our previous coverage here</a> on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>It's also got a vast library of martial arts moves and weapons, and you can build relationships with NPC and recruit new martial artists. To top it off are multiple endings, offering a high level of replayability.</p>
<p>If you're not already convinced, the PC version of this game is highly rated - with "overwhelmingly positive" user reviews on Steam. It's also received some glowing reviews from critics. Here's additional PR, which notes how the upcoming console versions will include two major DLC content packs and new voice overs.

<p>The upcoming PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch versions published by Clouded Leopard Entertainment will include two major downloadable content packs previously released on Steam: “<strong>Mount Pack: The Supreme Steed</strong>” and “<strong>Immortal Trails Across the Blue Sea</strong>.”</p>
<p>In addition, these versions will feature newly recorded Japanese and Chinese voice=overs, as well as Japanese and Korean subtitles, allowing players to experience the sweeping Eastern epic in even greater depth.</p>

<p>Get ready for an even bigger launch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During PlayStation's '<a href="https://youtu.be/DJp8K40TSxc?t=563">State of Play</a>' broadcast this week, Koei Tecmo and Omega Force issued a reminder about the "major DLC" on the way to the 1 vs. 1,000 musuo early next year.</p>
<p>The <strong>Visions of the Four Heroes</strong> will add new stories and weapons when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$34.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) and pre-orders are now live on select platforms. This date lines up with the base game's launch on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here's some additional details, and you can check out the latest overview trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visions of Four Heroes features brand-new stories centered around four heroes whose stories were not explored in <em>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS:</em> Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao and Lu Bu. These stories are explored as “What If” scenarios and will allow players to discover new sides to these legendary heroes. New companions are also featured in the major DLC including Zhuhe, a Guardian of Peace; Diaochan, a beautiful warrior and a familiar fan favorite; and a mysterious new officer who will be revealed as the story unfolds.</p>
<p>"Fans will also be able to enjoy new weapons – the “Bow” and “Rope Dart” – to further enhance the exhilarating action of 1 vs. 1,000 warfare by leveraging each weapon’s unique characteristics on the battlefield. Existing weapons will also receive an update, granting new arts, skill panels, as well as an increase in the trait level cap. Finally, a new “Training Ground” mode will be included, where players battle formidable foes while practicing their skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you pre-order the DLC, for a "limited time" you will also receive an exclusive outfit for the protagonist (the "Yellow Turban Attire"). Below is some more information about this. There'll also be an early purchase bonus and a digital pre-order bonus for Switch 2 players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Designed to embody the heroic spirit of DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS, this costume lets players take to the battlefield clad in the symbolic garb of the Yellow Turban Rebellion."</p>

<p>Get a head start!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Alongside a new story trailer today, Square Enix has released an eShop demo for its upcoming Switch and Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
<p>This demo will allow you to experience the opening of the new game, including the first chapter of three different story arcs from the "Retribution story, as well as the first chapter of the "Restoration story" (or up to three hours of gameplay).</p>
<p>Save data will also carry across to the full release when it arrives next month on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3f24bc2675cee"><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f24bc2675cee/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's some extra information about what you can expect in the demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing you’ll do is design your protagonist, and play through the explosive introduction to the game. You’ll discover how a joyful town festival turns to tragedy, and how your hero embarks on a journey of restoration and revenge.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You’ll set off after three antagonists, known as the Masters. Each of them has their own ‘Master of’ arc, and in the demo, you can play through the first chapter of each of them in any order you please.</p>
<p>You can also play up to the end of the first chapter of the ‘Kindlers of the Flame’ story arc, which focuses on the restoration of Wishvale and the town-building features of the game. It’s a great way to lay some strong foundations before you build the town of your dreams in the full game!</p>
<p>You can play through all this content for up to three hours. After that, the demo ends.</p>

<p>Is that...?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, Square Enix is releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 next February.</p>
<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play broadcast</a> earlier on, the team behind this reimagined release shared a new "follow-up trailer", briefly highlighting the journey ahead for the party of heroes. Fans also got a glimpse of - <strong>spoiler alert</strong> - an older-looking Kiefer, who you'll be reunited with on your adventures.</p>
<p>Here's the official description about Kiefer's return:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the core elements from the original remain, #DragonQuest VII Reimagined offers streamlined progression, fuller character development, and new storylines...</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You'll run into an older looking Kiefer during your adventure to the Rucker region of the past. Your party will sneak into Rucker Castle at night to help him. Don't let the guards spot you! If they do, don't worry — Kiefer has honed his skills and will support you in battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll get to fight alongside Kiefer again elsewhere...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the release of this trailer, Square Enix has also <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1988389037942640860">gone into a bit more detail</a> about the additional content and new locations in the game. To unlock these areas, you'll need to collect "fragments of broken stone tablets, fit them together, and place them on a pedestal of the same color".</p>
<p>You'll do this at The Shrine of Mysteries, which is located on the island your party calls home. Each stone tablet will lead to a different location with its own problems to solve. As you help out locals, you'll transform the world, with new islands appearing out of nowhere.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193754,193420 @ 1762931959 -->
<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is due out for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.
