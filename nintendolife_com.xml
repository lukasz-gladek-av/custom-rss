<p>If we build them, they will run</p>

<p>Asobism's tower defence/roguelite/factory sim title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shapehero-factory">ShapeHero Factory</a>, releases on Switch 2 (and 1) today. Hooray!</p>
<p>For anyone unfamiliar, this one sees you create an army of robots from a bunch of magical shapes within a factory setting, making for a sweat-inducing puzzle of sorts as you work to get your automation processes up and running before battle.</p>
<p>The twist? You don't actually get to control the robots you make in the ensuing fight here. Nope, it's all about the factory, levelling up through artefacts and creating more and more powerful units to keep on, er, powering through.</p>
<p>Here's some further — and much more official — details and screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mass-Produce Heroes<br></strong>Transport basic shapes from the scroll to assemble your heroes with different combinations. Circles with triangles will make soldiers, while circles and squares make sprites. Add squares to soldiers to give them shields. Perhaps you could create stronger heroes by combining soldiers together…</p>
<p><strong>Hold the Gates<br></strong>The Great Calamity lies deep within the Book of Magic. To bar your heroes from invading, his forces will come to demolish your gates. Maintain the defense while you forge ever deeper into the book. The servants of The Great Calamity each has its own method of attack, so you must choose the right hero for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Factory-Building and Roguelite Elements Make For Endless Possibilities<br></strong>Obtain rewards from a randomly generated list of options after winning battles.<br>
Will you unlock new artifacts (facilities), or upgrade your existing ones?<br>
As you continue making these tricky decisions, you will create a wholly unique factory!<br>
The choices that each author (playable character) will face as well as the types of heroes that they can create are different, so you need to challenge a different “factory-building” each time you play.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to Grow Stronger<br></strong>The enemies are powerful. With the experience points gained at the end of the game, players can use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to grow permanently stronger. This means that the more you play the game, the stronger you will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game left Early Access and went live with version 1.0 just yesterday over on Steam, where it's got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2389040/ShapeHero_Factory/">688 "Very Positive" reviews</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>ShapeHero Factory is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shapehero-factory-switch/">available from the Nintendo eShop for $23.99</a>, or whatever that equates to where you are. It's out on Switch 1, too, for the same price. According to Nintendo's game page, there's no specific upgrade pass for the Switch 1 version (and saves aren't transferable between them). HOWEVER:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the release date, players who own the Nintendo Switch version of this title will be able to obtain the Nintendo Switch 2 version free of charge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to argue with that! We're having trouble finding specific details on what the Switch 2 version does above and beyond Switch 1 - better frame rate and resolution, you'd imagine, especially as the game page suggests a ~400MB file size increase on Switch 2. We'll update you with any details we find out.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/gloomy-eyes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-gloomy-eyes-switch-if-captain-toad-were-a-cosy-horror-game.1301331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Growing up, I absolutely loved <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/medievil">MediEvil</a> on the PS1. The spooky yet lighthearted aesthetic really spoke to me as a child and would ultimately help foster a lifelong passion for the horror genre. So when I saw trailers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gloomy_eyes">Gloomy Eyes</a> from developer Fishing Cactus, I was instantly enamoured with the Tim Burton-esque vibes.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Inside</a>, Gloomy Eyes is a puzzle-adventure that stars two characters, Nena and Gloomy, who begin an unlikely friendship. Described as "self co-op", the game is strictly single-player, but you’ll be swapping between the two protagonists on the fly in an effort to complete each level, while voiced narration provides context and backstory.</p>
<p>The levels themselves are presented as spooky dioramas, and a quick press of ‘-’ will bring the camera all the way out so you can scope out the entire environment. It reminds me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>, in a way, albeit with much larger levels and puzzles that often require a bit of backtracking. That’s a scary word for many, but each level here takes mere minutes to complete, even if you have to spend time traipsing around in confusion before figuring out what to do. It’s a breezy experience, one that can easily be polished off in just a few short hours.</p>
<p>Puzzles are pretty tactile in the sense that you're always interacting directly with the environment with objects found on the fly, and you’re often required to complete objectives with one character to open access for the other. Gloomy, for example, can’t stand the light, so you might need to shut off the power as Nena. Alternatively, Gloomy is adept at chucking rocks, so hurling one at certain lights knocks them in the other direction, freeing the way to proceed while blinding an enemy stalking Nena.</p>
<p>Exploring the environment, picking up items, and discovering how they interact with obstacles is satisfying, but it can often be quite tricky to make out certain details within the world. This is usually due to two key reasons: the fixed camera angle makes depth perception difficult, so you’re never quite sure whether certain pathways are actually accessible until you start venturing down them; and the game just looks a bit messy on the Switch.</p>
<p>The art design is wonderful, but the slightly blurry visuals and washed-out colours can look unpleasant at times. It’s a shame, because it looks a real treat on other platforms, so this is yet another instance of Switch players getting an objectively lesser experience. It doesn’t look much better on Switch 2 either, but it’s at least fully functional if you want to try it on Nintendo’s newer system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, disappointing visuals aside, there’s a lot to like here. It definitely falls into the ‘cosy horror’ sub-genre, with spooky yet charming aesthetics, haunting music, and engaging puzzle-solving throughout. With Halloween on the horizon, it could be the perfect little primer for younger gamers.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/gloomy-eyes]]></content:encoded>
