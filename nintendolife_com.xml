The runway looks inspired a ready-to-wear line of their own by Difuzed, and what do you know, this collaboration is now available to buy from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/pokemon-x-jimmypaul-by-difuzed">Pokémon Center website</a>.</p>
<p>Let's make one thing clear right from the jump, these items ain't coming cheap. The collection covers a range of products from bags and caps to t-shirts and jackets, and while you're looking at around £39.99 / $39.99 for the smaller items, the bags and jackets are closer to the £200 mark and beyond.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkxolmr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>That said, there are some rather nice pieces in here, each inspired by a different Kanto 'mon. We're particularly fond of the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/70-11298-101/pokemon-jimmy-paul-by-difuzed-mew-mini-bag">Mew Mini Bag</a>, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/70-11299-101/pokemon-jimmy-paul-by-difuzed-gengar-cap-one-size-adult">Gengar Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/70-11287/pokemon-jimmy-paul-by-difuzed-electabuzz-knit-sweater-adult">Electabuzz Knit Sweater</a> — which, now we think about it, would make for a rather snazzy outfit altogether — but there's plenty to choose from besides.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of items in the collection:</p>


<p>You'll find the full line-up on the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/pokemon-x-jimmypaul-by-difuzed">Pokémon Center website</a>. It's an expensive way to evolve your wardrobe, sure, but the prospect of living our Lumiose fantasy is almost too much to resist.</p>

<p>Okey dokey</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, folks, after it was briefly teased at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> has finally arrived on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Yep, just in case you haven't picked this one up in the last decade, you now have <em>another</em> chance to do so (or an opportunity to simply pick it up again, we won't judge). The Anniversary Edition throws in all six official add-ons — Automatron, Far Harbor, Nuka-World, and the three Workshop expansions — and over 150 pieces of Creation Club content, so there's a lot to tuck into.</p>
<p>Of course, you're probably wondering how it all holds up on Switch 2. In the above video, we'll show you exactly that! The gameplay footage covers the opening section of Fallout 4, some open-world exploration, more than a dash of combat and even a cutscene or two. In short, there's a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>The good news is that it looks really rather good. Sure, the visuals are looking a little outdated today, but everything seems to be holding up nicely, performance-wise. Heck, after Bethesda's disastrous launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> on Switch 2, you can never be too careful.</p>
<p>We'll have our full review with you before long, so keep an eye out for that one. In the meantime, you can pick up Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Fallout-4-Anniversary-Edition-3016467.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£52.99 / $59.99</strong>, or hang around until 28th April to get the code-in-a-box 'physical', if you want.</p>
