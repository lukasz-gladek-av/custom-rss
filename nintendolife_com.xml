<p>With physical versions and everything!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>ININ Games has just announced that a brand new entry in the iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_r-type">R-Type</a> series is on its way to Switch consoles in May 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a> sees players return to the franchise's signature side-scrolling bullet hell warfare against, well, a whole bunch of weird s**t, sir. It's coming right at us!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. Flashbacks, innit. Working closely with Tozai and Irem (so that's the original creators and licence holders onboard), ININ describes this one as "one of the most ambitious and significant undertakings in ININ’s history." So stick that in your pulsating xenomorph skull and smoke it.</p>
<p>Building on the legacy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/r-type_dimensions_ex">R-Type Dimensions EX</a>, this new game apparently completely re-envisions the core action with cutting-edge visuals, sounds and more in the way of gameplay modes.</p>
<p>Here's some more details from ININ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> brings the intensity, precision, and creative enemy design of the arcade originals to a new generation. Every stage, boss, and projectile pattern has been rebuilt with high-end 3D graphics, enhanced animations, and richly detailed environments, whilst preserving the instantly recognizable atmosphere that defined R-Type’s identity.</p>
<p>The same applies to the original music and sound effects. With an enormous effort, everything has been rebuilt so that Players can switch seamlessly between the original and the new R-Type III at any time, offering both nostalgic authenticity and a striking modern reinterpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Key features include:</strong></p>
<p>A fully remastered experience with completely reconstructed assets</p>
<p>Local co-op, enhanced with new scoring and survival mechanics</p>
<p>Advanced mode is accessible from the start</p>
<p>Customizable controls and quality-of-life features in the settings</p>
<p>3D Camera settings (normal and crazy)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we mentioned, there are also physical editions to get hold of here, with a special and collector's version as detailed below!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Special Edition<br></strong>The Special Edition includes the full game, a beautifully crafted artbook showcasing concept art and visual development, as well as the complete new original soundtrack, perfect for players who want to dive deeper into the creative universe of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>. This edition will be sold for € 59,99.</p>
<p><strong>Collector’s Edition<br></strong>For devoted R-Type enthusiasts, the ultra-limited Collector’s Edition offers everything from the Special Edition plus a selection of exclusive bonus items. The centerpiece is a highly collectible figurine based on the new cover interpretation. This exclusive edition is priced at € 199,99.</p>

<p>Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble join the party next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced that it will soon be expanding the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library with a pair of classic 3D platformers.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a> will be added to the service on <strong>17th December 2025</strong> (that's next week!), so expect to see a lot of floating hands/feet with no arms/legs attached to 'em.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1999 by Ubi Soft, Rayman 2 sees you tasked with saving the Fairy Glade from Admiral Razorbeard and his army of robots. There's all of the usual collecting and platforming peril that you would expect from a Rayman title, but we remember having a jolly good time with this one back in the day, and it's always nice to have an excuse to pick it up again.</p>
<p>Ubi launched Tonic Trouble the very same year, and while not quite as beloved as its platforming pal, it brings the weirdness with its story. This one will have you playing as an alien named Ed, who's sent down to Earth to clean up a little supernatural conqueror problem after he inadvertently pollutes the planet's water supply with a strange liquid.</p>

<p>Those with an NSO + Expansion Pack membership will be able to play both of these titles on the service next Wednesday.</p>
