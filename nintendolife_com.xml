<figure data-uuid="13ef8c2ae915b"><a title="Luigi's Mansion 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/13ef8c2ae915b/luigis-mansion-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has provided the clearest indication yet that it intends to acquire more development teams to "strengthen its internal development organisation".</p>
<p>The comment can be seen on page 54 of its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">financial report</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-plans-to-strengthen-their-game-development-capabilities-by-expanding-facilities-and-acquiring-other-developers-as-subsidiaries.1344088/">ResetEra</a>), in which Nintendo lays out the steps involved in utilising funds to build the business foundation. It outright states that its plan includes "initiatives such as acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries and augmenting our development facilities, and the construction of Corporate Headquarters Development Center, Building No. 2".</p>
<p>This might, on the surface at least, go against <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-would-rather-organically-expand-the-organisation-than-rely-solely-on-acquisitions">Nintendo's statement last year</a> in which it said it would rather "organically expand the organisation" over the acquisition of developers. Though while this latest reveal from the company appears to indicate a more aggressive stance, we can't imagine Nintendo suddenly going on a development shopping spree anytime soon.</p>
<p>It's an interesting shift from the company though, right? Could we perhaps see a team like MercurySteam join the fold after its exceptional work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>? It's nothing but speculation on our part for now, but we think it's clear that more acquisitions will happen in the future – possibly within the next financial year.</p>
<figure data-uuid="aa08a93ca5567"><a title="Nintendo - Financial Report" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aa08a93ca5567/nintendo-financial-report.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how things develop in the coming months and years, at least. Switch 2 is going to be an exceptionally important console for Nintendo, and the company will want to ensure that it has all hands on deck to keep the games flowing.</p>

<p>A Mega Announcement?</p>

<p>At 6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm GMT (or your local time), we'll be getting an "update" on the DLC, which will feature two versions of Mega Raichu and the Mythical 'mon Hoopa.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1986071000522313913">Japanese Twitter account</a> gives us a bit more info — specifically, that it'll be on YouTube. So expect a trailer, then!</p>

<p>The expansion is due to launch before the end of February 2026, so perhaps a release date is on the horizon already?</p>
<p>Will we see some new Megas? Or will it simply be an overview? We'll find out in less than 24 hours.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59kvnmzw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
