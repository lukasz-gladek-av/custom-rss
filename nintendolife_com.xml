<p>Total Digital Eclipse of the heart</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/18dac4deea960/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been eagerly anticipating more news on Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-comes-to-switch-and-switch-2-in-2025">revealed</a> last month with a 2025 release window, and while nothing has been <em>officially</em> shared, it looks like a more specific release date might have accidentally leaked — via the Xbox App, no less (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-looks-like-its-been-leaked-early-by-xbox">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>As noted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> Reddit forum, the Xbox App briefly had the upcoming collection listed for <strong>29th/30th September</strong> (thanks to the magic of time zones) over the weekend, though there was no official word from Digital Eclipse. The app listing has since reverted back to the 31st December 2025 placeholder that we so often see deployed for titles awaiting a specific date, but not before more than a handful of people clocked the change.</p>
<p>Speculation quickly ensued on the Reddit thread, with folks theorising that the devs might formally reveal the release date at EVO 2025 next weekend, or perhaps even that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumoured Nintendo Direct</a>. Either way, the specification of the app's date and its subsequent removal has made us a little less sceptical of this leak than we normally would be — even if we are still treating things with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>For those who missed the Legacy Kollection reveal in last month's State of Play, this one sees Digital Eclipse hit up the "interactive documentary" format once again, with interviews, commentaries and interesting materials about some of the biggest games in MK history. That accompanies "over 20 different versions" of iconic Mortal Kombat titles, with the current lineup including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mortal_kombat_ii">Mortal Kombat II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ultimate_mortal_kombat_3">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_advance">Mortal Kombat Advance</a> and many more.</p>

<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157643/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It seems like every <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Direct</a> spends more than half its runtime detailing updates for or announcing casual <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-spin-off-games-of-all-time">Pokémon spin-offs</a>. From <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Pokémon Café ReMix</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, we’ve gotten so many Pokémon-themed experiences that any new announcements outside of the Generation X games feel as tired as a Snorlax after a large meal. This gives the most recent release — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a> — an uphill battle to gain the attention of an increasingly broad Pokémon audience.</p>
<p>Pokémon Friends features a collection of simple puzzle-style minigames that reward you with different types of yarn that you can then throw into a Plush-O-Matic to pop out a collectible Pokémon Plush. From Sparky Yarn to Creepy Yarn, each corresponds with Pokémon types. For example, you’ll get Ghost and Poison-type Pokémon from Creepy Yarn like Gengar and Croagunk, while Sparky Yarn yields only electric critters like Pikachu and Pachirisu.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157645/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yup, Pokémon Friends is more or less a gacha game, albeit not a punishing one. Most yarn types have a rare Pokémon to pull at about a 2% rate compared to the other ‘mons at around 8%. You can place these plushies off in little room dioramas or give them to NPCs looking for a specific type to complete daily quests in order to collect more furniture for your rooms, and that's about it. There's no online functionality like a trading system or a way to share your rooms.</p>
<p>The plushies are definitely cute, but as there are only about a dozen to collect of each type of yarn, pulling your favourites doesn’t feel quite as exciting as pulling an Immersive card in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> or another comparable gacha game. I don’t count this as a negative, necessarily. TCG Pocket is far more 'predatory' while Pokémon Friends maintains a much less stressful vibe; that said, if you’re looking to grind out the full Plush Dex, you likely won’t find it all that rewarding an experience.</p>
<p>Actual problems begin to pop up like Digletts when you start playing the puzzles. These aren’t designed for 35-year-olds like myself who have played Pokémon since they were 9 years old; rather, they’re simple puzzles made with children in mind that were clearly created for mobile play and not the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157648/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is seen in the puzzles themselves — which we’ll get to — and the way they’re presented. In the free mobile version of Pokémon Friends, you need to drop $9.99 USD otherwise you’re locked to just a few puzzles each day. In turn, this means you’ll get to pull way fewer plushies, making the entire experience far more drawn out.</p>
<p>On Switch, you have to pay $9.99 to even download the game with two $15 puzzle packs available to purchase that add an additional 10 puzzles and 40 plushies each automatically into the pools. This means that with the initial purchase you can play as many sets of puzzles as you want and pull as many plushies as you want in a given day, unless you restrict yourself with an in-game setting.</p>
<p>As we purchased the Pokémon Friends Combo Bundle that comes with the two puzzle packs for the slightly discounted price of $35, we had a total of 50 puzzles to experience. Each time you play, Pokémon Friends throws at you three random puzzles with around three to six stages of that specific puzzle to complete.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157640/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>They start off incredibly simple but level up in difficulty after each completion. Many of them focus on shapes, like Pumpkaboo’s Shadow Show, where you have to judge what the 2D silhouette of a 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/tetris">Tetris</a>-like block will look like when Pumpkaboo casts light upon it. In others, like Lotad’s Ferry Service, you guide a cute little Bulbasaur across a pond by figuring out the correct Lotads to ride on.</p>
<p>Despite how much I enjoyed seeing some of my favourite Pokémon star in their own minigames, I grew tired of several of the puzzles rather quickly – even with all 50 puzzles unlocked. I can only imagine how tired I’d grow of Pikachu’s Power Line and Greninja’s Secret Shapes if I only had the base 30 puzzles to play, especially when those puzzles sometimes repeat the same stages at higher difficulties and you can't pick which ones you'd like to play or block the ones you're bored of.</p>
<p>Pokémon Friends was clearly designed with the mobile version’s daily restriction in mind, which makes playing for more than a couple of hours at a time a detriment to the experience.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157637/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And as you’d expect in a mobile-first title, most puzzles greatly benefit from the Switch’s touchscreen controls. You see, the quicker you solve the puzzles, the better quality yarn you receive, giving you a chance to pull an extra plush and to reach new high scores. If you want to play docked with a controller, you’ll still be able to clear every puzzle, but you’ll definitely lose a few seconds here and there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, trying to organise your plushies in a room with both the controller and touchscreen is an exercise in frustration; the drag-and-place function simply doesn't work all that well with room depth, which makes placing your Flygon next to your Salamance plush an annoying endeavour.</p>
<p>Despite starting off simple enough that toddlers can take them on, the puzzles begin to show some bite around level six or seven, with a max level of nine. Mind you, they never reach <strong>Professor Layton</strong>-levels of mind-straining difficulty, but even those 35-year-olds that grew up with Pokémon will have to pause and think every so often at higher levels.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157642/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I certainly preferred some puzzles over others. Think Outside The Box had me rotate a box crammed with squares and rectangles to free a Rowlet or Slowpoke from within, providing a lot of thoughtful challenge at later levels. And I enjoyed most puzzles where I controlled a Pokémon directly, such as Topsy-Turvy Espeon that uses blocks and gravity in clever ways.</p>
<p>At the same time, I didn’t enjoy guessing the amount of hidden crates behind the visible ones in Blocked Boxes, nor did I find Square Solver and Tricky Triangle appealing when they popped up; both simply require you to connect-the-right-dots to make the required shape and have no relationship with Pokémon other than some background art.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether I enjoyed specific puzzles or not, they were all responsive and smooth on the Switch 2 I played on. That said, Pokémon Friends still seems out of place on Nintendo's handheld hybrids. The entire package has a 'freemium' mobile feel that would be easier to digest if it were, for example, a free-to-download title with $5 puzzle packs instead of a $9.99 base purchase with more expensive DLC.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, even the fun puzzles began to grow stale after only a few hours of play as they're so quick to complete and pop up so often, which dampened my enthusiasm for unlocking Mudkip and Jirachi plushies to decorate my rooms with.</p>
<p>I have no desire to boot up Pokémon Friends daily for a few quick puzzles like how I rip packs in TCG Pocket, leaving me with the sense that this puzzle package will fade into the background with other casual spin-off titles, forgotten about until the next Pokémon Direct that announces a handful more overpriced puzzle packs instead of Generation X.</p></section>

We mean that in a figurative sense, of course — it's the game that has dominated most of our time of late — but some arty fans have taken it much more literally.</p>
<p>Take Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/freakintoddles/">freakintoddles</a>, for example, who recently took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">r/NintendoSwitch</a> forum to share their latest creation: a Switch 2 dock cover modelled on DK's iconic barrels. It looks bananas in the best possible way and, what's more, its creator has even shared how you can make one yourself... if you have a 3D printer to hand.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The cover is designed to clip around your Switch 2 dock, with the barrel design only encasing the front of the stand to let those fancy cooling fans do their job on the back. You can get a closer look at the print in the following snaps from its <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1632494-switch-2-donkey-kong-dock-cover#profileId-1724371">Maker World</a> listing:</p>

<p>In the absence of any Switch 2 special edition models, we'd be lying if we said that the funky DK design didn't look a little bit nice — and is there really any better way to show your Bananza love than a dock cover that <em>might</em> send your Switch 2 blasting through brambles at any moment?</p>
<p>We called DK's latest "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">our review</a>, which you can check out in full below.</p>
