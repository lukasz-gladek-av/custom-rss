<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161150/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">Warhammer</a>, I have to say, is something that I've only come to really appreciate properly in recent times. I was never particularly bothered until I picked up a big starter pack of wee guys and big monsters to paint (y'know, for my kids), and then a proper, no-holds-barred addiction set in.</p>
<p>I needed lore. I needed more! And so video games, as ever, have ended up being a very important part in my journey, and this time it's a journey towards a deep understanding of Warhammer. Something like that. Anyway, in short, I've been banging through your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_boltgun">Warhammer Boltguns</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">Mechanicuses</a> (Mechanici?) in order to get myself all up to pub-chat levels of knowing stuff about the franchise. Breezily japing with the lads over a bevvy without sweating being found out. That's the goal.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, recent times have brought us a swathe of what I'm gonna go ahead and proclaim as the best Warhammer video games we've ever had. The licence is being wielded wisely, and the likes of the aforementioned Mechanicus and Boltgun on Switch, alongside the mighty <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine 2</a> on other platforms, have gifted fans of all things space murder a blood-soaked smorgasbord of shotguns and shot wrong'uns. Again, something like that.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161144/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>"Stop rambling and get on with the review, Grimgor, we don't all have hundreds, or possibly even thousands, of years to spend chit-chatting!" (Check out that pub-level knowledge, amirite folks?). So, now, we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> arriving on Switch 2, and this is another one of the games that I've dug into (on another platform, for shame) over the past year or so in order to sate my big Warhammer appetite. And it's excellent. Let's just get that out of the way. I'm already a big fan of this one before booting into its Switch 2 port, so all they need to do here — all they <em>need</em> to do to stroll to an easy victory — is dish out the goods in working order and we're all in for a treat.</p>
<p>Before we get into the performance, though (as if you can't see that score), let's first get into what's involved in Owlcat Games' epic — you're looking at well over 100 hours here, chief — isometric adventure. Rogue Trader (not be confused with the terrible Ewan McGregor movie) sees you dive into intergalactic battle in the Koronus Expanse, as anyone with pub-level Warhammer knowledge will know is a very dangerous place indeed.</p>
<p>Taking control of a party of six combat units, and in keeping with the original TTRPG, the game thrusts you into strategic, turn-based combat whilst peppering the action with big dialogue choices and player-driven decisions that feed into a unique "Realm Building" mechanic. This sees the world affected by the path you choose to forge, and it's this mechanic that really ties together and elevates a game that also delivers the goods in terms of its strategic scraps and worldbuilding. It's a very solid package indeed.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161146/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>If you've played the likes of Mechanicus (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">which is another banger by the way</a>), you'll sort of know the drill. The Warhammer universe suits this sort of video game down to the ground, and as usual there's depth to spare in the combat skirmishes, tons of replayability built into its ever-changing narrative, and loads of fun to be had in co-op modes - and even a bit of ship-to-ship combat.</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to go on and on and really gild this lily big time, whilst telling you how this Switch 2 port's slick performance helps bring all of this cleverness to life and make it pop, but unfortunately as things currently stand, there's no real point. Indeed, I have to say, this is one of the worst-performing things I've played on Switch 2 so far. Emperor's bowels, indeed.</p>
<p>From the moment you boot into Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader on Nintendo's console, you can tell you're in for a very bad time. The first swooping camera shot of the entire thing, as the game settles down upon your player character and another NPC, stutters and strains as it circles a big tower that's very obviously had all of the graphical spit and polish removed from it. A big visual downgrade, and one that chugs and splutters along, easily down into sub-20fps territory, whilst also crashing consistently, taking an absolute age to load between scenes, and having you stumble about in unresponsive menus. It's not good.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161149/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The combat excels in its brutality, with opportunistic attacks which make for devilishly fluid face-offs that can turn on a dime, but it's derailed thanks to controls that are ruined by the frame rate. It's genuinely hard to place the movement cursor where you want it at times.</p>
<p>So, instead of having a great time (and it's easily a great, if not excellent game when working well) building our own rogue trader's empire, exploring space, and interfering in the fates of planets, we're left in a situation where I think it's best nobody be tempted to buy this thing until it's been fixed up. Until you can shotgun the face off an enemy with nary a stutter.</p>
<p>It's very frustrating. The combat is so crunchy and brutal and full of strategy, it really is some fine stuff, and there's cunning required on anything but the lower difficulty settings to best some ferocious and wonderfully well-designed foes. The narrative is also solid overall, especially given the genre (I shan't spoil in the hopes we get a magical patch in the future), and the decisions and dialogue tree aspects all come off really well thanks to some top writing and perfectly gruff voice-acting. Replayabilty is built in here, and it's one of those things that portable play makes sing, absolutely.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161145/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Gosh, I so want to give this game the score it deserves! However, it's a big-time swerve. I should also note that, whilst I had zero issues with this game on a high-powered PC, I am aware that it does run like trash on Steam Deck, so perhaps this is something worth noting. We shall need to wait and see.</p>
<p>For now, though, a wildly vacillating frame rate, unstable resolution, hugely downgraded visuals, unresponsive and sluggish controls and menus, and multiple crashes to the Switch home screen put this one far beyond a recommendation.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a cracking bit of turn-based Warhammer action that delivers big on strategic and atmospheric combat whilst also serving you a top-notch, choice-driven narrative and campaign. Hooray. However! This Switch 2 port, at release, is a borderline disaster, and not something I recommend anyone pick up until it's had some patching done.</p>
<p>A constantly stuttering frame rate, long loading times, unresponsive and laggy menus and controls, a huge graphical downgrade, and hard crashes aplenty make for a mess of a port. Let's hope they fix it up, because for now, it's a hard pass for a great game.</p></section>

<p>"Adding support for two new languages"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="b91f86b373321"><a title="Mega Man 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b91f86b373321/mega-man-11.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's been a huge week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man</a>, with Capcom <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">revealing a brand-new entry</a> in the series will be coming to the Switch, Switch 2 and other platforms in 2027.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Capcom has another announcement to share about Blue Bomber. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_11">Mega Man 11</a>, which was released on the Switch in 2018 (<em>that's</em> <em>seven years ago!</em>), has received a new update. It adds support for two new languages to the game: Latam Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>Players will be able to swap languages from the options page under the Language Settings. Here's the official announcement:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jxhopt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>This has already led to some fans on social media requesting more updates for this particular entry – including calls for a resolution and performance upgrade on the Switch 2. Capcom hasn't said anything about additional updates for Mega Man 11 in the future, and this update was out of the blue.</p>
<p>If you haven't already played Mega Man 11, there is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/capcom-game-awards-switch-and-switch-2-eshop-deals-save-up-to-85percent">currently a sale for the game</a> taking place on the eShop (reducing it to £3.74 / $4.49), and you can also download a demo. In our review here on Nintendo Life, we gave this title nine out of ten stars, calling it a glorious return for one of gaming's greatest heroes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mega Man 11 is an excellent resurgence for the Blue Bomber, imbuing the tried-and-true classic gameplay with modern touches and new ideas that expand on existing concepts in interesting ways. The underlying action platforming gameplay is just as tight and challenging as you remember, and when combined with the new visuals and extra options for replayability, you’ve got a game that’s every bit as good as those that came before, while surpassing them in some ways."</p>

<p>With prices ranging from $169.95 to $299.95, the keyboards feature key art from the Sonic franchise, including the Blue Blur himself, Shadow, an 'Escape from the City' theme, and a more retro-style approach.</p>
<p>The Dreamcast model is the most luxury of the bunch, sporting a slick, minimal design and new Dampening Plus technology, with layers that mute everything but the keystroke and provide extra stability.</p>
<p>You can also utilise the Higround Forge browser app to completely customise lighting and keybinds, with profiles and settings stored on the keyboard hardware.</p>
<p>So let's take a closer look at each model...</p>

<p>There has been a fair bit of news in the world of Nintendo this week. The Game Awards came and went, bringing a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">fair few announcements</a> and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">couple of prizes for the Big N</a>.

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Oh gosh, there is so much that I want to play and so little time to play it! Despite having a good time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> so far, I'm still only a couple of hours into it. I'm hoping to remedy that this weekend, but I'd also like to check out the Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC, and finally wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, which leaves time for... not much else.</p>
<p>Hey ho, back to the sofa we go!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>As is customary in the race to catch up with the year's games, I've distracted myself with something from eons ago that has zero relevance to 2025 GOTY discussions. The kids saw the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy REROLL</a> icon on my Switch menu, and that was that. Helluva game, and its compulsive mix of simple goals, absurdity, and awesome audio has been a salve in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm still playing the brilliant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simogo_legacy_collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (which managed to haul me from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a>) and I'm enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Okay, so how much did Leon’s gameplay in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> look like a cross between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">6</a>?! Wild. So of course that means I’m playing more RE this weekend. Specifically… yes, 4 and 6. Leon’s back baby, and I couldn’t be more thrilled.</p>
<p>I do, however, think it’s about time I actually play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> properly. It’s been sitting on my home screen since launch and I’ve played the tutorial battle about 10 times before something else comes along and distracts me. Maybe I need to stop playing so much Resident Evil…<br>
Nah.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>By the time you’re reading this, I will have completed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and that is my GOTY 2025. I will be feeling a great emptiness in my life, that joy of experiencing a great work for the first time forever gone, the eagerness to see what comes next, find a new upgrade, fight a new boss and conclude Samus' and her fellow stranded Federation soldiers' ordeal (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a> sequel when?). More time to wrap up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>'s proper ending and return to the streets of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>.</p>
<p>My game of the week is the much-delayed, much sublime Terminator 2D: No Fate. Bitmap Bureau took on a tall order by grabbing a franchise that is held dear in the hearts of gamers of my generation, but seems to have pulled it off. While <strong>Terminator 2</strong> is one of the finest movie sequels ever produced, it never got a 2D platform run’n’gun game it deserved until yesterday. Maybe the future is gonna be OK after all.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, my mother-in-law has come to stay! What kind of games do mothers of the in-law variety enjoy? Well, I know she likes Mr Bean, because we watched two hours of <strong>Mr Bean</strong> last night. Is there a Mr Bean game? I don't think I want to play it.</p>
<p>I'm still making my way through <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and I just discovered the radio, which is now my favourite thing about the game. And it never tells you about it! Imagine playing <strong>Fallout</strong> without the radio. It would be a very different game. TOW2 has a similar musical vibe, with lots of jazz and swing, except it turns out that it was all commissioned for the game from real jazz and swing bands, with lyrics that reference in-game brands. Yes! All the music is advertising jingles! And it RULES. The lyrics are very funny, especially when you're only half listening as you wander through space and you suddenly catch a line like "Come get your candyyyy (it's tobacco) delicious candyyyy (that's tobacco".</p>
<p>Since it's getting close to Christmas, me and my partner are also considering what our Christmas Time game will be! Right now, he's replaying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> (it's just as good as you remember it being!) but I've also got him the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Collection</a> on Switch, because he expressed interest in wanting to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>. He probably won't read this, so I'm pretty sure it's fine to say that here. But don't tell him, okay?</p>

It turns out this might be one of the final significant patches.</p>
<p>According to a roughly translated post on social media, the game's director Masahiro Sakurai said the Kirby Air Riders development team will be disbanding in the near future. As a result, there's only a short amount of time left to make balance adjustments.</p>
<p>He goes on to say how there may be one more round of adjustments, but after this, work on the racer is likely done.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adgvpsqu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>See what it's all about</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom yesterday announced its new sci-fi action adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, starring Hugh and his android companion Diana, would be coming to the Switch 2 in April 2026.</p>
<p>As you might have already heard, this title (where you explore a lunar research station) adds a "unique hacking twist" to gameplay - combining basically puzzle solving, fire fights and more, as you take down robot enemies. To help illustrate what's going on, Capcom has now uploaded a new "hands-on" impressions video, featuring some of its "friends" who explain their own experiences with this new game.</p>
<p>Once again, the demo for Pragmata is available to try out now on Steam, and will be "coming later" to the Switch 2 and other console platforms. Here's a bit about what you can expect when it does arrive on Nintendo's hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay demo, known as Sketchbook, lets you try out the tactile combat system that fully engages both sides of your brain, while you also get to experience what it's like to traverse the lunar research station."</p>
<p>"You might discover new things as you replay the demo! Complete the demo to receive an illustration from Diana and don't forget to share it with #PRAGMATA on your socials."</p>
