<p>Don't worry, we had to Google it too. For those wondering, 'Pokécology' is the study of Pokémon based on their assigned habitats. It all stems from Yoshinari Yonehara's <strong>Pokécology: An Illustrated Guide to Pokémon Ecology</strong>, the best-selling Japanese Pokémon book, which, conveniently, will be getting an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/preorder-the-upcoming-book-pokecology-an-illustrated-guide-to-pokemon-ecology">English translation</a> later this year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fiwqkjm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>What this means for the merch is a whole lot of dino vibes. The Pokémon Company has already revealed a handful of pieces you can expect to find if you're lucky enough to hold a ticket to the pop-up store (now sold out), including a dinosaur Pokémon print, special pins, a research notes Pikachu tote, and a plushie of that same Electric Type hugging the museum itself.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also revealed a special oversized TCG promo card to mark the collaboration, which shows Pikachu walking the museum's iconic central hall. This card will be available from select UK retailers from 30th January.</p>
<p>All of this merch and more will be available in the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop from 26th Jan - 19th April.</p>
<p>For those who couldn't snag a ticket to the collaboration, TPC has confirmed that a selection of the exclusive items will be available on both The Pokémon Center and the Natural History Museum's online stores — just brace yourselves for the dreaded 'Sold Out' messages...</p>
<p>On a related note, The Pokémon Company yesterday shared more details on London's <em>other</em> upcoming pop-up store at next month's European International Championships. Gosh, it's a hell of a time to be nursing that post-holiday bank balance.</p>
