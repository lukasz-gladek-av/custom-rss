<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ad062caaa12f/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Video game media has now been tearing up the track in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for a week now – so what's the final verdict?</p>
<p>This new entry, including a whole world to explore and Knockout Tour, is currently sitting on a critic score of 87/100 on Metacritic, with "generally favorable reviews". And on OpenCritic, this "mighty" new game has an average critic score of 86/100.</p>
<p>Starting with our own here on Nintendo Life, we've given this title a score of 9/10 – calling it the perfect introduction to a new console generation:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749702812 -->
<p>So, what did other sites have to say? <a href="https://www.vooks.net/mario-kart-world-switch-2-review/">Vooks.net</a> gave the game 5/5 and called it "peak" Mario Kart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’ve never seen <em>Mario Kart</em> look, run, and sound this good. <em>Mario Kart World</em> is peak <em>Mario Kart</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">IGN</a> awarded the game 8/10 but weren't quite as taken with the open-world aspect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-mario-kart-world-is-a-perfect-welcome-to-switch-2/">Siliconera</a> called World the "perfect welcome" to Switch 2, also awarding it a score of 9/10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s fantastic in more traditional modes like Grand Prix and Battle or new ones such as Knockout Tour and Free Roam. It pays tribute to past games, but feels totally different and innovative in some fun ways."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/71382/mario-kart-world-switch-2-review">Nintendo World Report</a> dished out a score of 8/10, even though it was hoping for more from the game's open-world component:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If there’s one part where the Free Roam loses the plot, it’s by not offering any kind of split-screen option aside from a low-key hack in the Local Wireless lobby. The fact that players can’t explore the world together with multiple kart racers fooling around at once is a huge miss."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Eurogamer</a> gave Mario Kart World a score of 4/5 stars – labelling it "entertaining, snackable, fun" but was also left wanting more from the free roam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Free Roam had the potential (and probably still does, depending on how Nintendo chooses to update the game) to consume me, but some rather typical Nintendo quirks mean it's at its best when you're dipping your toes in rather than going for a full-on dive."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-review">Tom's Guide</a> encountered some speed bumps during its own review, finishing with a score of 3.5/5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Overall, it's another solid effort in Nintendo’s enduring kart-racing series, with the fantastic Knockout Tour mode a highlight. However, this Rainbow Road isn’t without some bumps. The new Free Roam mode is undercooked, and it’s frustrating that it bleeds into franchise staple offerings, making them worse."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And going out with a bang, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a> served up another 9/10, calling the overall experience of Mario Kart World "incredibly fun and rewarding" and a "worthy marquee title" for the new system's launch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be shocking if this game doesn't enjoy the same long-term success of its predecessor, because it's among the best in the series and a worthy marquee title for the launch of a new Nintendo console."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> fans got quite a surprise when Nintendo unveiled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a> – a new spin-off, exclusive to Switch 2.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Nintendo announced it was also updating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> – adding a new batch of weapons, the return of Urchin Underpass, and making various other adjustments and improvements to enhance the squid-shooter on the new (and existing) Switch.</p>
<p>Now, with Version 10.0.0 going live today, Nintendo has released the full patch notes for this update. Here they are, courtesy of the official support page:</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12emqglyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

</table>
</li>
<li>Added a Series Weapon feature to Anarchy Battle (Series) for Rank S and higher.
<ul>
<li>In Anarchy Battle (Series) for Rank S or higher, Series Weapon Power will be measured for each weapon players equip. They will be matched with other players whose Series Weapon Power is similar to theirs for the currently equipped weapon.</li>
<li>Series Weapon Power is the same for all four modes.</li>
<li>Players can check their current Series Weapon Power for each weapon by pressing the ZL Button on the Equip screen to display the weapon's details.</li>
<li>Series Weapon Power resets each time the season changes, but the highest value players have achieved will be recorded in SplatNet 3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Anarchy Battle (Open), increased the amount of change in Rank Points per battle by approximately 2.5x.</li>
<li>Made it so that call signs, which are automatically determined using factors such as equipped gear, will display in X Battles in place of nicknames.
<ul>
<li>After the battle ends, you can check players’ actual nicknames and IDs (the string of numbers and letters starting with #) on screens for checking results, such as the match menu and the lobby terminal.</li>
<li>For X Rankings, players’ actual nicknames and IDs will display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to SplatNet 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players’ Best Nine will now display.
<ul>
<li>“Best Nine” indicates the nine weapons with the highest Series Weapon Power out of all the weapons a player owns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Best Nine rankings will now display.
<ul>
<li>Best Nine rankings are rankings where players compete for total Series Weapon Power for their Best Nine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notifications from SplatNet 3 will now display in the notifications box within the Nintendo Switch App.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the maximum value for weapon Freshness to 10★.
<ul>
<li>Players can earn new badges for weapons by achieving Freshness 6★ to 10★.</li>
<li>Once the update has been applied, weapons that had received XP beyond the maximum value before applying the update will have their Freshness increase after one battle by an amount proportionate to the amount of XP received up to this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new badges players can acquire based on the number of weapons with Freshness ★★★★ or higher.</li>
<li>Made it so that other players a player has battled with in Anarchy Battle (Series) and Splatfest Battle (Pro) will not display in the Users You Have Played With system feature of Nintendo Switch/Nintendo Switch 2 consoles.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus update, in this update we added weapons and a stage, increased the maximum Freshness, implemented a Series Weapon feature for Anarchy Battle (Series), added a call sign feature to X Battles, and performed optimization of operations on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>For Anarchy Battle (Series), we implemented a new Series Weapon feature targeted toward players Rank S or higher.</p>
<p>With this feature, the Series Weapon Power will be measured for each weapon currently equipped, and players will be matched up against others with similar levels of power.</p>
<p>We implemented this feature in hopes that players will enjoy battling using a variety of weapons, including the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi / Emberz weapons added in this update.</p>
<p>Additionally, we made balance changes to multiplayer battles.</p>
<p>For S-BLAST ‘92 and S-BLAST ‘91, we have made adjustments to give players fighting against them more room to counter because, from the opponent's point of view, there seemed to be no openings at any distance.</p>
<p>For the Crab Tank, we lowered the maximum damage of the cannon to decrease the frequency that the person being attacked is defeated without any opportunity to evade. We also made it easier for other special weapons to fight against the Crab Tank.</p>
<p>For Toxic Mist, we have reduced the amount of ink consumed to make it easier to fight in combination with main weapons. On the other hand, we have simultaneously extended the time before ink begins to recover so that this change does not lead to tactics where players simply continuously throw their sub weapons.</p>
<p>The next update will focus on multiplayer balance based on analysis of changes to the situation that come with these weapon additions.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixes to Player Controls</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue on Nintendo Switch 2 where players were sometimes able to Squid Roll in places not inked by their own ink.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on Nintendo Switch 2 where, when a player in swim form landed from a high place in a place not inked by their own ink, sometimes the landing point would get inked.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when a player attempted to use the A Button or L Button to throw a clam, power clam, Fizzbang, or Golden Egg during the brief period where sub weapons cannot be used immediately after finishing a splatana swing, the line indicating the predicted impact location displayed even though it was not actually possible to throw.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when performing a charged slash with a Grizzco Splatana, the reticle would switch to the crosshairs for a horizontal slash before the charged slash was initiated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixes to Multiplayer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in certain stages where, when Super Jumping from certain positions to certain other positions, sometimes players were unable to land at the intended position.</li>
<li>Made changes to ease an issue where game operation slowed down when players exploded things like the Reefslider at certain locations in Scorch Gorge.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Marlin Airport where, when a player hit a propeller with the explosion from Explosher or Custom Explosher, the propellervator’s movement was less than intended.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Lemuria Hub where, when using the Ultra Stamp, players could sometimes enter their opponent’s base in unintended ways from the moving terrain in the center.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixes to Side Order</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the player skipped animations at certain timings, sometimes unintended screens would display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the player plays a battle replay for a battle where the Big Bubbler was used and moves the replay position, sometimes the player’s equipped weapon and the Big Bubbler would not display properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>As noted, the next update for Splatoon 3 will be focused on the game's multiplayer balance and the new weapon additions. You can find out more about what else to expect from Splatoon 3 and the newly announced Splatoon Raiders in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
