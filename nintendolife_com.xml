<p>Too much water</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company wrapped up today's Presents with the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>, the new mainline games in the series.</p>
<p>We don't have anything specific on the release date front at the moment, though TPC confirmed that the games will receive a "global simultaneous release" at some point in <strong>2027</strong>.</p>
<p>This was more than we expected for a first peek! Aside from some panning shots of the new region (complete with its fair share of water-y areas, naturally), the trailer also introduced the game's three starters: Browt, Pombon and Gecqua.</p>
<p>There was also the tease of underwater exploration (hello, Gen III fans), and Pikachu in some rather swanky summer outfits — they are characters in their own right called Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu (yes, really).</p>
<p>Here's a bit more info about the upcoming titles' region and differences from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/see-the-new-trailer-for-pokemon-winds-and-pokemon-waves-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">The Pokémon Company</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves. The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times.</p>
<p>Your main character will sport a different outfit depending on which version of the game you play—and of course, you’ll set out with one of three first partner Pokémon. Will you choose a Grass type by partnering with Browt, the lively but clumsy Bean Chick Pokémon? Or perhaps you’ll heat things up with a Fire type by picking Pombon, the guileless and friendly Puppy Pokémon. If Water types are more your speed, then the intelligent Water Gecko Pokémon, Gecqua, might be the partner for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best news, in our eyes, is that it actually appears to be running pretty well. Sure, the environments look a <em>little</em> sparse at the moment, but the promise of all those different biomes, the exclusive mention of a Switch 2 release (at the time of writing), and the fact that there's still another <em>year</em> of development time for Game Freak to tinker away leaves us cautiously optimistic.</p>

<p>Music to your ears?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a mini Game Boy as part of its 30th anniversary Pokémon Presents, but it's not quite what you might have in mind.</p>
<p>The Game Boy Jukebox / Game Music Collection is a small music player themed after Nintendo's Game Boy into which you slot one of 45(!) mini Pokémon Red or Blue cartridges, which unlock one track each from the original 1996 games.</p>
<p>On the 'inside' face of the carts are pictures showing screenshots from the games corresponding to the track they play.</p>


<p>Shown off in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/watch-pokemon-presents-february-2026-live">Pokémon Presents</a> in a segment with original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Blue</a> composer Junichi Masuda, he said that they "took particular care to make the audio sound just like a Game Boy".</p>
<p>It's available from today (27th February 2026) from the Pokémon Center in North America and the UK, but not from the German, Australian or New Zealand branches. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/">the Pokémon Center website</a> has a message saying to "Check Back Later Today to Get the Game Boy Jukebox".</p>
<p>Here are a couple of pictures of the genuine article. As you can see, it has the product code GBG-01, a nod to the original Game Boy's DMG-01. We've asked if it has a headphone jack and were told that it doesn't.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/4521329425030.html">official Japanese website</a> for the device shows off that region's cart and box art for Pokémon Red and <del>Blue</del> Green and lists the price as 9,900 yen - approximately $64 / £47. It's explicitly shown off as a keychain adornment, so it's clear that this is a novelty device and not something for chiptune audiophiles.</p>
<p><em>Interested in picking this up? We'll update this article with more information as soon as we find out the price.</em></p>
