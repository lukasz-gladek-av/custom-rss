            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-dk-rap-is-back-in-donkey-kong-bananza-but-nobody-told-its-composer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="dk rap credits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebfcd677b20e3/dk-rap-credits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, as we reported on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-the-dk-rap-is-in-donkey-kong-bananza">the DK Rap is back</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which as we all know is a very good thing indeed!</p>
<p>However, one (perhaps expected, on past evidence) little wrinkle is that Grant Kirkhope, the illustrious composer of the DK Rap, alongside music for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">Goldeneye</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/viva_pinata_pocket_paradise">Viva Pinata</a>, and a whole bunch more didn't actually know the rap was going to be used in the game.</p>
<p>As Kirkhope himself explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-wasnt-aware-the-worst-rap-track-in-the-history-of-rap-tracks-would-be-included-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Eurogamer</a>, he hadn't been made aware of this most recent usage, which didn't come as such a big surprise to him.</p>
<p>Describing the rap itself, which he created for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, as "the worst track in the history of rap tracks" (has he not seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Re4aDJL3heA?si=3AdUhICSOqi6iSC1&amp;t=150">the John Barnes rap</a>?) Kirkhope, who also wasn't credited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, pointed out that's just not how Nintendo do things.</p>
<p>Speaking last month about being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/grant-kirkhope-apparently-got-a-bananas-reason-for-his-missing-mario-movie-credit">left out of the movie credits</a>, he explained to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo... Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The composer tried appealing to Nintendo on other levels about being left in the movie credits, but the company won't be budged, it seems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Nintendo are notorious sticklers for the rules they lay down, it's hard to see how we'll get 'Grant Kirkhope' (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/random_childish_gambino_sampled_donkey_kong_country_and_david_wise_definitely_approves">Dave Wise</a>, for that matter) appearing in the credits for Donkey Kong Bananza — and he's gonna have to wait and see like the rest of us, we guess — but at least he's remained humorous about the whole thing. "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Of course, we all know Grant is quite the celebrity in the gaming realm, so we don't think he need worry about being forgotten (this writer will shout his name aloud when the rap starts in Bananza).<em><br></em></p>
<p>Now...should...should we all watch it? You only live once, right?</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Feeling good about having the DK Rap stuck in your head for another 26 years? Let us know!</em></p>

<p>Before anyone suggests it's a photoshop, the fine folks at VGC have actually seen it with their very own eyes. The same outlet notes how there is a similar "out now" ad for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> alongside it, but the Metroid banner appears to be jumping the gun here.</p>

<p>One theory is this could simply be a template and someone forgot to remove the "out now part" on the Metroid ad. The entire tunnel is also covered in other banners featuring the Switch 2's game library, which further suggests this is <em>probably</em> a slip up.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Nintendo did shadow drop <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> on the Switch in 2023, but given the build up to the fourth major outing and the recent Switch 2 confirmation, this type of release seems far less likely in this case. And hey, we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a> to look forward to next month.</p>
<p>For now, Metroid Prime 4 is currently locked in for a <strong>2025</strong> launch. The Switch 2 version will include enhanced resolution and frame rate as well as additional features like Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8bbf56f765b4d/super-smash-bros-ultimate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday rolled out a new update for the Switch 2 which also included some backwards compatibility fixes for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these happens to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and an issue with the Mii Fighter. Thankfully, in the latest system firmware update, the problem has been fixed (<em>thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Polley001" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Life user 'Polley001'</a> for the heads up</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo has shared the following information on the game's eShop page about this:</p>
<h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game progressions may be affected in portions of the game.</p><p><figure data-videoid="FHjNdrGk2jw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4052a3lqgwrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjNdrGk2jw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Updated 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fixed:</strong> When playing online, when a Nintendo Switch 2 player and Nintendo Switch player were matched and someone was using Mii Fighter, it was possible for the match to end immediately.</p>
<p>When creating or editing and saving a Mii Fighter, the thumbnail image showing the Mii Fighter may not appear correctly. This may be improved by saving it again. This is planned to be fixed in the near future.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, online match issues with Mii Fighters should be resolved. Apart from this, Nintendo says it's also resolved a problem with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As documented in its backwards compatibility PDF, "the frame rate goes to 30 frames per second during football matches in Play Globally (the speed does not change).</p>
<p>According to the title's eShop page, this has now been updated:</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Sports - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Updated: 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p>Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update.</p>
<hr>
<p>Again, both of these titles were already flagged on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/?srsltid=AfmBOor8Tut3SZbnGbzhkc8DvoSvTHxmahk-PbAEP5aDct6q2TKARuOK">backwards compatibility page</a> and were scheduled to be fixed. Nintendo also released game updates for certain other titles yesterday to resolve some backwards compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Along with these first-party game fixes, multiple third-party experiences have been improved thanks to the latest system update. "Previously identified issues have been resolved" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/IceClimbers" rel="nofollow">IceClimbers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/siavm" rel="nofollow">siavm</a>). We tried out an online match of the second fighting collection and it appears to be working on the new hardware.</p>
<p>Some other issues in games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N.

<p>Following a recent story about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-demo-kiosks-are-being-spotted-in-us-stores">Switch 2 kiosks popping up in US stores</a>, we've now got a small but exciting update.</p>
<p>If the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct left you wanting to play the game right now, apparently a demo of the game has been added to these same kiosks at locations like Walmart and Target in the US. You can enjoy ten whole minutes of this upcoming release.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn't said if it will be making this demo, or anything similar, available on the Switch 2 eShop, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you don't have access to one of these kiosks, there's not long to go now – with the full release of Donkey Kong Bananza scheduled to land next month on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. Nintendo is also releasing a new DK and Pauline amiibo on the same date.</p>
