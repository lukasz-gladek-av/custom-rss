<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across The Unknown</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>18th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Daedalic has shared a "Combat Deep Dive" (above) from developer gameXcite to mark the occasion. Pre-orders are available now, and it's also been confirmed that a demo – which is up now on Steam, PS5, and Xbox – will make its way to the Switch 2 "soon". The demo is inspired by the pilot episode 'Caretaker' and contains roughly one hour of gameplay, including a guided tutorial.</p>
<p>A Deluxe Edition will also be made available for pre-order, containing the following additional content that will be integrated into the main campaign: "new missions, new recruitable heroes, and powerful technologies drawn from pivotal alien encounters in the Delta Quadrant".</p>
<p>According to the official description, Across the Unknown "blends exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices. Experience crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe — with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities."</p>
<p>It sounds like it might be the perfect thing for fans of the series, but we'll have to wait and see for sure when it launches next month.</p>
