<figure data-uuid="7add030a48a3d"><a title="The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+ 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7add030a48a3d/the-binding-of-isaac-repentanceplus-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nicalis</em></figcaption></figure><p>Publisher Nicalis and developer Edmund McMillan have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/binding-of-isaac-repentanceplus">The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+</a> will be heading to the Switch 2 in <strong>Q1 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The release will boast the full game alongside key expansions and improvements, plus full cooperative play via online connection. If that's not enough, Repentance+ will also benefit from a full physical release, so no Game-Key Card here, folks.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://store.nicalis.com/products/repplus?variant=46804993999105">official Nicalis store</a>, though we'll be honest, we felt a bit of minor bit of whiplash at the <strong>£54</strong> asking price. It's not horrendous, but it's also not what we'd call 'affordable'.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Online play in all game modes, including daily runs, Greed mode, and challenges.<br>
- Extensive preference filters when hosting or searching for online matches.<br>
- Emote wheel and voice chat for online communication.<br>
- New “Item Descriptions” option reveals the full functionality of items you’ve previously collected.<br>
- New leaderboards for online play.<br>
- Over 700 different items to collect.<br>
- More than 300 enemy types and bosses.<br>
- Multiple difficulty settings, game modes, branching paths and endings to discover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chances are this one will almost certainly be available digitally, so we'll be sure to provide more updates, including its price, as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Live on Kickstarter now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/rune_factory_4">Rune Factory 4</a> director Shinichi Manabe is currently hard at work creating a new farming sim alongside writer Takanori Tsuji, and it's now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1005170304/farnia-village/description">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Farnia Village</strong> is currently eyeing a release on Steam, but Manabe-san also states that a console release may be on the cards at some point in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game is being optimized to run comfortably on hardware comparable to the Nintendo Switch, which means it should perform well on most laptops. Looking ahead, we hope to bring the game to home consoles in the future, if possible."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The big hook (if you can really call it that) for Farnia Village is that you can continue living in its world long after you've completed the main quest. You'll be tending to your crops, looking after animals, forging relationships with the local residents, and more. In short, it's a farming sim through and through.</p>
<p>As for the release date, well... it sounds like it's quite a ways off, at the moment. The earliest delivery date listed in the pledges is 'September 2027', but some of them even state 'September 2028', so who knows. We won't be seeing this one for a while yet, and it's possible a console release could be even further out.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter is creeping toward its ¥5,000,000 goal (roughly £24,845) with another 29 days to go. Stretch goals include extra characters more dungeons and crops, and additional music tracks. If this all sounds good to you, then consider checking out the full campaign when you have a moment.</p>

<p>Yes, as spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/upachan64" tabindex="-1">@upachan64</a> (thanks, <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/news/lanky-kong-and-chunky-kong-head-to-dk-bananza/">Gaming Reinvented</a>), both Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong appear to be entering the fray as unlockable figures. This comes via the Japanese version of the Switch 2 news app, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this event, you can obtain figures of Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong from Donkey Kong 64. Just like Enguarde and the others, these are exclusive items that can only be obtained here, so please join in!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4kovxqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>It goes without saying that you'll need the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> DLC to access the in-game events. As for this one, judging from the screenshots attached the news piece, it looks like it'll be taking place on the Hilltop Layer, one of the earlier locations in Bananza.</p>
<p>Chances are we'll be getting an official announcement here in the west very soon, so we'll be sure to let you know as soon as it happens.</p>
<p>Either way, yay! The boys are coming back! Kind of, sort of...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
