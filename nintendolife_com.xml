<p>A brand new world?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a4e4c23e4d38/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is finally out, making it the first proper new mainline entry in over a decade. Chances are if you've bought a Switch 2, then you've probably bought Mario Kart World too, so we're eager to see exactly what you make of it so far.</p>
<p>Before we do, however, let's just remind ourselves of what we thought. Alana provided the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">big review</a> for the game and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At first, this doesn't quite feel like the reinvention of Mario Kart that people wanted or expected, but the more time you spend in the open world and racing with friends, you’ll uncover a mechanically rich kart racer full of secrets and joy. Mario Kart World refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Few games have brought me as much laughter as Mario Kart World has done since launch. If you need a pick-me-up, this game is sure to bring a smile, and it feels like a perfect start to Switch 2's life."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749817291 -->
<p>At the time of writing, Mario Kart World is currently sitting at 87 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-kart-world/">Metacritic</a>, which means that it's currently viewed as 'generally favourable' from a total of 75 critic reviews.</p>
<p>So now it's over to you. While we think it's unlikely you've completed 100% of the game with every possible secret uncovered, we imagine you've probably experienced all of the tracks by this point and have a solid understanding of the its many quirks.</p>
<p>Still, your chosen score isn't written in stone. Feel free to give it a preliminary verdict now and revisit at a later date. Alternatively, you can always come back here if you feel you simply can't provide a score just yet. So cast your verdict in the below poll and let us know exactly what you think of Mario Kart World after just over one week.</p>

<p>You're probably not meant to do that</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="delivery driver throws switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f6d199b6a5f9/delivery-driver-throws-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's a hectic old time, is this new console business. There are new games, new hardware, new bits and bobs of every description to read up on, buy and, if you're a delivery driver, to get safely from warehouse to customers' homes. Of course, not all delivery drivers are built the same or employ the same techniques to ensure that your goods — in this case a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>, apparently — arrive as they should.</p>
<p>For us, regardless of the package, well, we would assume most would adopt a fairly routine method of walking right up to the door and handing it over to whoever lives there, who in this case is likely waiting for a shot on Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>However, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/delivery_man_throws_my_nintendo_switch_2/">as seen on u/NintendoSwitch</a>, one gamer has apparently captured — via the magic of the humble doorbell camera — a delivery man using an entirely new method.</p>

<p>New skill unlocked! As you can see in the clip above, this particular technique involves throwing the parcel (hopefully they got some bubble wrap in there) in the general direction of a house.</p>
<p>This particular shot didn't make it all the way to the door, although it did fairly well. Maybe next time!</p>
<p>Happily, the poster also confirms <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/comment/mxfporg">a little down the comments</a> underneath their video that the Switch 2 was, box aside, quite remarkably fine!</p>

<p>A happy ending.</p>

<p>How does it hold up?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Given the improved specs in the recently released Switch 2, it's not entirely surprising that the system's battery can't quite keep up with its predecessor's (though with the increased size, one has to imagine that Nintendo could stuff a bigger one in there). But just how good / bad is it?</p>
<p>Well, our lovely video producer Alex has put it through its paces to see exactly how long it's likely to last with a variety of different games. To start, he sat down and played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> until the battery died completely, going from 100% right down to 0%. This lasted for just over 2 hours and 10 minutes, though it's important to note that Mario Kart World is a flagship title for the console.</p>
<p>When testing other games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>, the battery ranges from just over 2 hours to around 5 and a half (though these are rough estimates based on how much battery percentage is lost over a 20-minute session).</p>
<p>So all in all, the Switch 2's battery is about what you'd expect from a console of this calibre, putting it in line with other powerful handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally.</p>
<p>We're hopeful Nintendo might provide updated models later down the line with improved battery life, but for now, this is about as good as we're going to get.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Having recently been slated for a July 31st release date on Nintendo Switch, the upcoming — and very exciting — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will now also receive two physical editions. Get in!</p>
<p>Silver Lining Interactive has an assortment of physical editions of this Dotemu/The Game Kitchen collaboration (just two of the best in the world at this sort of thing working together, no big deal) available for various platforms, and Switch players aren't being left behind.</p>
<p>These physical editions ("breathtaking", according to Silver Lining), which take the form of your usual standard and special variants and are scheduled for 12th September, are broken down in the PR blurb:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Standard Edition delivers<br>
-</em> <em>Full-throttle game for PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch<br>
-</em> <em>Heart-pounding <strong>soundtrack<br>
-</strong></em> <em>Retro booklet</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Special Edition Includes:<br>
-</strong></em> <em>Standard edition contents - <strong>Game, Soundtrack and Retro Booklet<br>
-</strong></em> <em><strong>Cloth map</strong> - frame it or study it like a true warrior.<br>
-</em> <em><strong>4 metal pins</strong> - Bold, pixel-art-inspired designs you’ll want to show off (or guard like treasure).-<br>
-</em> <em><strong>Double-Sided Hero Medallion</strong> - A solid metal coin featuring both protagonists: feel the weight of the legend!<br>
-</em> <em><strong>Pixel Stage Standee</strong> – A badass backdrop to show off your ninja pride on any shelf.<br>
-</em> <em><strong>Double-Sided Poster</strong> – Wall-worthy art showdown!<br>
-</em> <em>All encased in a premium <strong>collector’s box</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both physical editions are <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/search?q=ragebound&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">now available to order at Silver Lining's Direct website</a>, with the standard costing £34.99 and the special coming in at £59.99 (or whatever that ends up equating to wherever you are).</p>
<p>As for the game itself, well, with the creators of the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, working alongside the masters who've brought us the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous_plus_blasphemous_2_bundle">Blasphemous</a> franchise, we couldn't be more excited to see how this new new addition to the series melds its slick retro art style with aspects that fuse retro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/ninja_gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/ninja_gaiden_3_razors_edge">more modern 3D entries</a>.</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to grabbing a physical edition of Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound? Let us know!</em></p>

<p>13-second sprint round Koopa Troopa Beach, anyone?</p>

<figure><a title="MARIO KART WORLD REWIND LAP TIMES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aea2877ec2b85/mario-kart-world-rewind-lap-times.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Leave it to Nintendo to put a mechanic into a game that can be used in lots of 'unintended' ways. Then leave it to the typical Nintendo fan to figure out how to mess with it almost immediately.</p>
<p>Yes, just as we are routinely amazed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/random-game-dev-builds-baffling-contraptions-to-solve-zelda-totk-addison-puzzles">what players come up with in the likes of Tears of the Kingdom</a>, it's taken very little time for them to start <em>doing things</em> to Mario's fancy new rewind feature in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - which, when playing offline, allows you to cycle back through a race by holding down on your D-pad, then resume from where you paused.</p>
<p>For your average player (or just me) this will be deployed with zero imagination, used to correct course when we've crashed or fix things when we've taken a big blue shell to the bonce. That sort of caper. Of course, if you're a real gamer<strong>™</strong>, you'll do much smarter things.</p>
<p>Take, for example, YouTube creator <a href="https://youtu.be/TF3KYsz9ZLY?si=O23AHBjUV3M8D9bG">Jopes</a>, who (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/mario-kart-worlds-new-rewind-feature-can-be-used-in-time-trials-to-set-wild-records-like-this-13-second-lap/">and as spotted by GamesRadar</a>) uploaded a video showing how you can take a course that's nice and small (he uses a few, such as Koopa troopa Beach), and then rewind all the way back through an entire lap from the finish line.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that, because the rewind feature is sped-up, you reap the benefits of how quickly you move:</p>

<p>Once he'd honed his technique down (and you should check out the video above as it's really neat and packed full of detail), he's managed to get his lap time down to <em>12.856 seconds</em>!</p>
<p>Now, to get to that lap time, he's done some clever driving, too, taking shortcuts and going off-road, so do give the eight-minute video a watch as there's way too much nuance to detail here. Also, you can then try to best his time.</p>
<p>Of course, the new Mario Kart is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/youll-want-to-learn-these-new-mario-kart-world-tricks-if-you-hope-to-win">packed full of new ways to gain speed boosts and get better times</a> without resorting to rewind feature shenanigans, therefore we're sure we'll be seeing some more eye-opening stuff in fairly short order. Stay tuned.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 / PS5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a208dca657808/switch-2-ps5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been out for a little over a week now, and it's already breaking records in multiple regions. Nintendo has confirmed that the console <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold 3.5 million units in the first four days of sale</a>, but it's also become the fastest-selling Nintendo console in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>, and Japan. In the latter region specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">Switch 2 also beat the PlayStation 2</a> to become the fast-selling console <em>of all time</em>. Crikey.</p>
<p>Naturally, thoughts are inevitably turning toward Nintendo's direct competition, and whether the likes of Sony and Microsoft might be concerned about the Switch 2's monumental success. Well, <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html">according to SIE's new president and CEO, Hideaki Nishino</a> during a Business Segment fireside chat, the company isn't particularly bothered (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-sony-says-ps5-performance-required-for-great-experience-on-a-big-screen/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>When asked if the Switch 2's improved specs and Nintendo's relationships with third-party publishers caused any concern, Nishino was keen to reiterate the appeal of the PS5 against its competitors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We closely monitor the overall gaming industry, including the actions of other market participants. Additionally, catalysts in the market are great for the industry as a whole, as they invigorate the excitement and demand more broadly. So it’s great to have people launching new things.</p>
<p>“However, as I mentioned previously, we have a differentiated strategy. PlayStation 5 is designed for an immersive gaming experience, and this includes the innovative DualSense controller features as well. We believe PS5-level performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering for players and creators in this current console generation.</p>
<p>“However, publisher strategies are increasingly shifting towards being multi-platform, so more platforms can run the same game, which is great from a creator’s perspective. Among those platforms, our mission is that we will continue to be the best place to play and publish.</p>

<p>To be fair to Sony, the PS5 is a great system, though we'd be lying if we said that its first-party offering was thriving at the moment. Sony has struggled recently with its ill-conceived focus on live-service games, resulting in the highly-publicised failure of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/concord">Concord</a>, the cancellation of <strong>The Last of Us Online</strong>, and ongoing concerns around Bungie's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>That said, PS5 will have pretty tempting exclusives this year in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/saros">Saros</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> following later.</p>
<p>There's room for all, is what we're saying. But it's going to be interesting to see how the dynamic between the Big Three changes with the Switch 2. Chances are there are a few publishers who regret not supporting the Switch enough in recent years, so we suspect that will no doubt change going forward.</p>
