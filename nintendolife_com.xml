<p>We've got at least a year until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a> comes to Switch 2's shores, but we're <em>already</em> thinking about the game's first big question — which starter will you pick? And, we've got to be honest, Generation 10 put a particularly tough choice in front of us.</p>
<p>We've met the tempting trio already — the Grass starter, Browt; the Fire starter Pombon, and the Water starter Gecqua — but let's get to know them a little bit more before we ask you lovely readers who your early favourite is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22frzxjwk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<h3>Browt, the Bean Chick Pokémon</h3>
<figure data-uuid="df38de21ad353"><a title="Browt Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df38de21ad353/browt-pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"This Pokémon runs about energetically while photosynthesizing using the leaves on its brow. It’s lively, but it can also be a bit clumsy."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type: Grass</li>
<li>Height: 1′ (0.3 m)</li>
<li>Weight: 7.7 lbs. (3.5 kg)</li>
<li>Ability: Overgrow</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, look at this little fella! Our second Grass-type bird starter (following Rowlet from Sun &amp; Moon), Browt has a heck of a pair of eyebrows and some lovely lime green colouring.</p>
<p>They're smoll, they're round(-ish), and they have a big puffy tail. Very cute indeed.</p>
<h3>Pombon, the Puppy Pokémon</h3>
<figure data-uuid="d9b641678f771"><a title="Pombon Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9b641678f771/pombon-pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"The area below its throat glows faintly from the heat-generating organ within its lungs. This Pokémon is guileless and friendly."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type: Fire</li>
<li>Height: 1′4″ (0.4 m)</li>
<li>Weight: 14.8 lbs. (6.7 kg)</li>
<li>Ability: Blaze</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh goodness, dog lovers beware, we have the bestest boy (or girl) right here. Pombon is a pomeranian-inspired 'mon, fluffy and chipper just like the real pup.</p>
<p>We have a feeling this one'll be popular — just look at their face!</p>
<h3>Gecqua, the Water Gecko Pokémon</h3>
<figure data-uuid="fa9658d6bb8a6"><a title="Gecqua Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa9658d6bb8a6/gecqua-pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"This Pokémon launches springy balls of water from its tail. Gecqua is very intelligent and maneuvers shrewdly while putting on airs​."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type: Water</li>
<li>Height: 1′ (0.3 m)</li>
<li>Weight: 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg)</li>
<li>Ability: Torrent</li>
</ul>
<p>Water and lizards go hand-in-hand, right? Gecqua is a sleek-looking 'mon (more excellent eyebrows, too) who looks right at home in this water-filled region.</p>
<p>Will they give Sobble a run for their money? Who can say at this point...</p>
<hr>
<p>That's pretty much everything we know about the three at this point, and they're the only <em>new</em> Pokémon we've seen too. So don't go building a whole new team in your head. Even if lots of returning Pocket Monsters have already been shown off.</p>
<p>For now, based on early impressions, we want to know who your favourite new Starter is. <em>Get voting in our poll below, and debate the best new beginner in the comments.</em></p>
