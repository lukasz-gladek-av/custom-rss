<p>Shipping Spring 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've had mixed opinions on the CRKD Nitro Deck for the Switch, but now the company has come out swinging with a brand new iteration – and it's compatible with both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nitro Deck 2</strong> starts shipping in <strong>Spring 2026</strong> and looks to be a significant upgrade over the previous model. It seems the company has the Switch 2 in mind with this new product, but those still on the original Switch can still get in on the action. You'll just need to utilise the additional centrepiece to make up for the height difference, while turning the dial on the back to decrease the length of the chassis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Deck 2 has offset analogue sticks which, for the first time, aren't situation directly above and below the d-pad and face buttons. They utilise capacitor-based technology are said to be free from potential drifting issues. It also features additional back buttons, adjustable deadzones, turbo mode, and more.</p>
<p>The d-pad design and stick tops can also be swapped out, but be mindful that these additional parts are sold separately.</p>

<p>Pricing is confirmed at <strong>£89.99</strong> for the Nitro Deck 2 itself, while any addition d-pad/stick packs are <strong>£19.99</strong> each. Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2">CRKD website</a>.</p>

<p>Currently confirmed for "PC and Consoles"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><strong>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</strong> was one of the most surprising reveals at this year's The Game Awards, marking a huge return to the RPG series that put Bioware on the map.</p>
<p>The original developer is nowhere to be seen, however, with this new title now in the hands of Arcanaut Studios, founded in July 2025. Its CEO, Casey Hudson, is heading up development for Fate of the Old Republic (FOTOR..?), having previously directed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> and the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big deal, then. It's clear that the new game is early in development given how recent the studio itself was formed, and as such, no specific platforms have been confirmed beyond a rather vague "PC and Consoles". So we have no idea if this thing is heading to the Switch 2 or not, but we reckon it's a little too early to make the call either way.</p>
<p>The trailer itself gives us next to nothing, as you'd expect. It shows what is likely to be the main protagonist landing on a planet with two companions before making her way into a derelict crash site. There, she encounters a mysterious creature and ignites her lightsaber. That's it!</p>
<p>Lots of questions, then. Is this game even considered canon at this point? Our knowledge is a <em>little</em> rusty these days, admittedly, but our understanding is that the canon equivalent of the 'Old Republic' is now the 'High Republic'. All of that 'pre-Disney' stuff is now part of the 'Legends' continuity.</p>
<p>Still, it looks cool, and we'll be keeping a close eye on it in the months (and years) to come.</p>

<p>The following titles weren't graced with a Switch 2 logo at the end of their reveal trailers, but we think there's a pretty good chance of several them coming our way at some point down the line — either because the dev has sent their games to Switch in the past, or because the series has history with Nintendo consoles.</p>

<p>Cosmic conundrums</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Keplar Interactive and Japanese indie dev Shapefarm have announced that their brand new intergalactic puzzle adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a>, is coming exclusively to Switch 2 <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">The Game Awards</a>, which we shouldn't hold against it, Orbitals sees two players take on asymmetrical co-op tasks to stop cosmic storms from ruining their space station. Sounds quite tense. Set in a brand-new retro anime galaxy, the game is a debut effort from Shapefarm, and it's been built "from the ground up" for cooperative play, so we're looking forward to being treated to some smart puzzles, thanks.</p>
<p>You and your partner will set about utilising unique space tools, piloting a ship through meteor fields, or even just hanging out to revel in a retro anime vibe that's based off 1970s manga. So that's why the trailer, which you can see up top, looks so very cool.</p>
<p>Indeed, the devs have gone to the trouble of partnering up with Studio Massket, a storied Japanese animation house, to create a fully original anime world complete with hand-crafted cutscenes. Oh, and it's got full English and Japanese dubs (and you can check out the Japanese version of the trailer at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>It's nice, too, to see a game that's aiming to utilise all the new tech capabilities we've got on Switch 2, with GameShare, GameChat, and all that caper used to further enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Here's some more info and some official screens to further whet your appetite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orbitals captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm.</p>
<p>Developed in Unreal Engine 5, Orbitals takes full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware to deliver an unforgettable co-operative experience regardless of your preferred way of connecting together.</p>
<p>Either by teaming up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Nintendo Switch 2 device for split-screen local co-op, using the system’s GameShare feature to share Orbitals with another local player on a compatible Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch device, or by matchmaking online with their friends and taking advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat for crystal-clear communications, players around the world can team up and save the day together as one inseparable team.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Launching 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> might want to pay attention, because another co-op adventure is heading to the Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/out-of-words">Out Of Words</a> launches in <strong>2026</strong> and is a stop motion co-op adventure from developers Kong Orange, Wired Fly, and Morten Søndergaard, with publishing duties from Epic Games. You'll explore the "wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis" as Kurt and Karla, two mouthless individuals who must work together to overcome the odds.</p>
<p>The game got its public debut at Summer Game Fest in 2025 and received plenty of critical acclaim from those who went hands-on with the demo. It's lovely, then, that it's now been confirmed for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Find your lost voices in a co-op platformer adventure. Together with a friend, via online cross-platform or couch co-op, explore the wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis as Kurt and Karla in a story about the first time they held hands — where everything you see is crafted by hand."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Game Awards also confirmed the existence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> for the Switch 2 (with the latter also heading for the original Switch ).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Terminator 2D: NO FATE (Switch) - A Simplistic Yet Fascinating 16-Bit Love Letter]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/terminator-2d-no-fate</link>
            <guid>1381489</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161078/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Are you old enough to remember being a kid and seeing a NES, Super Nintendo, or Mega Drive game of a licensed movie, and having your imagination run wild as to all the playable scenarios potentially contained within? If the answer is 'yes', then you’re equally likely to remember the actual experience typically being rushed, poorly coded junk that barely resembled the material upon which it was based.</p>
<p>But, in an alternate timeline, UK developers Mike Tucker and Matthew Cope would grow up to form a future resistance in 2016 under the moniker Bitmap Bureau (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xeno_crisis">Xeno Crisis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_vendetta">Final Vendetta</a>). Their mission: return to the early '90s to create the 16-bit movie licensed game kids always dreamed of, before travelling back to 2025 to correct the past and save the world. Confused? Wait until you find out who the dad is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> <em>is</em> that game: prophesied to say "hasta la vista" to the memory of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Aljn">LJN</a> and its Skynet-like destruction of movie licenses. It recreates Cameron's action spectacular right down to the tiniest of details, forging it into the 2D gaming adventure it was destined to be.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161075/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What I value about Bitmap Bureau is that it always aims squarely for the Super Nintendo and Mega Drive game that never was. Terminator 2D’s entire design feels born out of an alternate timeline, like a genuine 16-bit companion to the movie’s 1991 release.</p>
<p>There are two starting modes and several locked bonuses, including a Boss Rush and an Infinite Mode. Story Mode is stuffed with cutscenes taken from the movie's sequences, with text outlining the narrative. It’s also a longer game, in that it’s bookended with stages that occur before and after the events of the movie, having Sarah Connor first retrieve a kidnapped John from a Mexican cartel, before breaking into Cyberdyne Research. This actually alludes to what John Connor tells his friend early in the film: that his mother was arrested trying to recover something she believes to be hidden within Cyberdyne's lab.</p>

<p>From there, you leap to the future war, playing adult John as he faces off against the machines, and the epilogue ensures there’s a climactic finale beyond Arnie's 'thumbs-up' farewell. As Bitmap Bureau isn’t restricted to following the movie’s blueprint in these original stages, they're actually some of the best: freer in design, more creatively bold, and teeming with colossal machine bosses.</p>
<p>In Story Mode you only have one life and four continues, but can greatly increase their stock by finding special icons throughout the campaign. With a generous life bar and liberally distributed health icons, it’s surprisingly easy on defaults — especially so when compared to Bitmap Bureau's infamously brutal Xeno Crisis. Seasoned gamers will likely finish it in just a few attempts, but tweaking the difficulty up from "No Problemo" to "Hasta La Vista" adds in additional enemies, rearranges some objects, and makes the time limit more pressing.</p>

<p>Finishing Story Mode once opens up new paths with new stages and characters to play, triggered at choice-based junctures. Will you off Miles Dyson in front of his family? Or will you install Arnie’s skull chip and finally get your hands on that Minigun? It’s an idea that greatly improves replay value, especially since the alternate routes are altogether awesome, and it takes the total number of stages to at least 16, as far as we can gather.</p>
<p>Arcade Mode, while equally soft enough to beat, requires you do so on one life and no continues. It’s also shorter, cutting out the precursor stages and cutscenes to focus only on the movie-related parts, making for a brisk, exciting experience. And, if you’re struggling to nail a particular stage, there’s a Practice Mode to help out.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is superb, blending those classic Terminator musical motifs into all-new mixes, and graphically it’s very impressive. The capturing of the movie’s characteristics is applause-worthy: fans will be grinning ear to ear and end to end as it works through every set-piece and minute detail in grand 2D style. The recreation of even the smallest of particulars is superb, from that burning tyre that rolls out of the post-aqueduct explosion, to the T-1000 getting Hasta La Vista’d into liquid nitrogen chunks. It’s all so thoughtfully reproduced, there must be an award in here somewhere for movie-license accuracy.</p>

<p>The sprite work, though, is a touch stilted in places. Most enemies look fine, collapsing to the ground fluidly when shot, but the human-sized guard dogs are just strange. Sarah Connor can’t bend her knees much and her gait appears stiff. And, while the giant, towering future war Hunter Killer machines and gunships look fantastic, we would have liked the emblematic T-800 endoskeletons to have had a little more presence and threat. It’s a mixed bag that mostly ranges from sufficient to great, and it’s a minor criticism in a game where tight controls gloss over any aesthetic dips. It’s just surprising that, with an art team capable of feats like animating the T-1000’s entire lava-death transformation, some of the sprites appear, well, slightly robotic.</p>
<p>Stages are piece by piece constructed from the movie’s sequences, and it’s all action all the way. There’s no faffing about collecting coloured keycards here: it’s all gunning, lobbing grenades, barging, punching and driving. Much of the game plays like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/contra">Contra</a>, with 8-way directional fire and a useful slide attack, but different characters have different moves depending on the scenario.</p>
<p>When Sarah is breaking out of prison (one of the more difficult stages in the game), she only has bare feet, a nightstick, and a lock-picking mechanic; but when she goes militaristic, planting bombs in Cyberdyne’s HQ, she can wield certain enemies as human shields and slide kick falling debris into encroaching assailants. In the famous “Your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle” sequence, you play naked Arnie in a simplistic beat-'em-up-inspired stage, roughing up bikers to the film’s actual background music (make sure you destroy that Jukebox!). Elsewhere, you race down the aqueduct as John, before switching to a shotgun-strapped Schwarzenegger to shoot out chain-link fences.</p>

<p>So much from the movie is present, in fact, I only lamented not getting to evade the T-1000 through a giant '90s arcade centre. Well, that and the fact Schwarzenegger's likeness couldn't be acquired for the game (but there are some clever workarounds).</p>
<p>In an odd way, Terminator 2D is so thorough in tracing the movie’s sequences that it almost doesn’t feel like a game in the traditional sense. Every stage is different, piecemeal, with clever gameplay implementations that make each feel unique — but it’s extraordinarily linear on the whole. Most stages take less than three minutes to beat, and go by in a flash once you know the layout. There is the odd hidden item to find just off the beaten path, and whether taking cover behind walls to avoid a laser barrage or triggering traps to catch the T-1000 in machine assemblies, it’s plenty of fun to learn.</p>

<p>At the same time, it’s more a series of endearing movie vignettes than a full-blown game in the traditional sense. By sticking to the source material so exactingly, it limits itself in scale, more akin to a compilation of arcade-like bonus games than a series of fully-articulated stages.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Interestingly, half of what makes Terminator 2D fun is its painstaking reproduction of the movie on which it’s based. Were it to have no relationship to a beloved IP, it would likely be criticised for its brevity, linearity, and general simplicity. Once fully beaten, you won’t likely return to it for anything except a nostalgia hit, but T2 fans and 16-bit diehards will feel well-served by its detailed reminiscence.</p>
<p>A great deal of the game's charm is derived from its novelty factor, and it's that novelty, in conjunction with some clever ideas and impressive authenticity, that should inform your purchasing decision.</p></section>
