<figure><a title="SIWIQU S3 MAX TV Dock Station For Nintendo Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0706b57b5d6ff/siwiqu-s3-max-tv-dock-station-for-nintendo-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's own dock is a non-nonsense device that just works. You slide your console in, crack the Joy-Con off, and boom, you're off to the races. Given the larger size of Switch 2, though, its dock is a substantial slab of black plastic and various third-party firms have stepped in with offerings that are a little more portable.</p>
<p>Antank is one such company, and the S3 MAX TV Dock Station for Nintendo Switch 2 — also known as the SIWIQU Dock Station in some parts — is certainly smaller than the dock that comes with the console. Weighing in at 109 grams (compared to 383 grams), you'll barely notice you're carrying it in your satchel, backpack, or anywhere else you care to secrete your hardware.</p>
<p>Antack sent me the standard model for review, although they have another one that includes an Ethernet port for wired internet connection. Otherwise, on the back of the dock, you get the expected ports: two USB-A slots, a USB-C port for the power, an HDMI port going to your TV, and a button to switch between TV-out and the Switch 2's own display. Beyond the dock itself, in the box you get a little foldout manual with the tiniest text I've ever seen, and that's your lot.</p>

<p>For $35.99 / £28.99, it should come as no surprise that you're not getting Nintendo-level build quality and materials, and the lightness here doesn't help sell the S3 as a premium bit of kit, either. But it's fine; the red and blue end caps match up with the accents around the Joy-Con, and sitting beside your TV, it looks pleasant enough.</p>
<p>You're also not getting an AC power adapter, the requisite cable, or an HDMI cable, and Antack recommends using Nintendo's official gear. If you've got a Switch 2, you'll obviously have that already, but if you're buying this as a cheap dock for a second room, you'll need to factor into your budget another $34.99 / £24.99 for the power adapter, plus an HDMI 2.1 cable (the ultra high speed variety).</p>
<p>Setup is as simple as you'd expect. Connect the cables, turn your TV on, and boom. It works. In fact, I had to reconnect the console a couple of times — apparently a quirk that's been ironed out with <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update">a firmware update</a> I've subsequently run according to the <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update-guide-for-windows">instructions on Antack's website</a> — but then it just functioned as advertised.</p>

<p>A little blue LED on the front indicates that everything's powered up. The S3 supports 4K (8K, in fact, according to the blurb, although you won't get that out of your Switch and I've got no way to display 8K content) and up to 120Hz output - although the Switch 2 can only manage 120fps at 1080p, and you'll need a 120Hz+-capable TV, naturally. Several hours of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> delivered image quality on a 55-inch LG OLED that looked indistinguishable from the official dock to my eyes. HDR fired up just as with the standard offering, and everything just worked.</p>
<p>Back to the unit itself, Antank's website blurb mentions a "spring-buffered docking port", although I can't see any evidence of a spring on my unit. The connection at the bottom is totally rigid and fits the console port snugly once you seat the thing correctly, which can take a couple of tries.</p>
<p>Having the system 'unsheathed', you'll definitely note the heat it's pumping out in a way you may not when it's resting in Nintendo's dock. The S3 effectively blocks the console's air intakes along the bottom edge, which gave me pause, but temperature-wise, the fact that the system isn't wrapped in black plastic helps disperse heat from the casing and "provides better cooling than the original charging dock", according to Antank. I don't have the equipment to measure that, unfortunately, and I'd question if the cooling is 'better' than Nintendo's dock, but it seemed roughly the same to me from a volume and temperature perspective.</p>
<p>Switching to handheld mode by hitting the round button on the rear, I noticed the console's fan whirring up more in the summer heat. Given the fact that you can charge via the top USB-C port anyway, I'd prefer to have those intakes uncovered in tabletop mode, personally. Yes, a cable sticking out the top isn't aesthetically pleasing, but I'd rather not tax my still-relatively-new system more than necessary when it's not outputting to the TV. Perhaps I'm being overly cautious, but honestly, I don't see much point in the tabletop button when that's built into the console as-is.</p>

<p>The size reduction is a boon, certainly, but the S3 does come with some minor irritations. Firstly, you'll need to hold the dock down before pulling to remove the console - there's no slide-in/slide-out here. The tight fit means that the S3 doesn't work with third-party cases, either, so you'll need to remove them beforehand. Also, the dock doesn’t seem to communicate with the TV to wake it from standby, if that’s something you’re used to with the standard dock.</p>
<p>While three rubber 'feet' prevent it from slipping, the dock relies on the power and HDMI cables being connected to provide stability and prevent everything toppling backwards at the slightest touch. Obviously, the Switch 2 has its own kickstand, so using the S3 as a makeshift stand doesn't make sense anyway - just be cautious when you're setting things up and don't put your system in the dock until the cables are connected.</p>
<p>And that's it. It's definitely more of a travel accessory in my eyes; if I were in the market for a second dock for the home, I'd probably pay the extra for the slide-in/out convenience (and the necessary cables) of the official option. If you're the kind of person eager to travel as light as possible, or who feels a missed opportunity when playing your Switch 2 in the shadow of a big hotel-room TV, the S3 might be for you, though.</p>
<p>And even factoring in the necessary extras, you're still a fair way off the $124.99 / £92.99 that Nintendo wants for a second dock with those essentials included. For the budget-conscious gamer, then, or travellers who fancy being able to hook up on the fly, it's a good option.</p>

<h3>"monthly minimum" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Game-key cards and fans that don't earn in Pounds, Euros or Dollars.<br>
Hello Nintendolife friends! Sebastián here from Medellín, Colombia (a big fan from the Global South).<br>
I'd like to talk about why you'd think that Game-key cards are better or worse for your own gaming experience.<br>
For context, videogames are really expensive when exchanged to Colombian Pesos, up to a fifth of our monthly minimum wage.<br>
Fortunately, I earn much more than a minimum wage, but it's still a luxury. So I buy Nintendo games based on 3 options:<br>
1) Physical cartridges that I'd like to collect (or play in the future with our soon to come kid); 2) Physical cartridges that I can play and then re-sell to earn some of the investment back; 3) Digital games on sale for a really low price based on Deku Deals' price history.<br>
Considering Nintendo's tendency to introduce more games as Game-key cards, my interest in physical games is every time smaller, which takes some of the magic away.<br>
What's your take on this? How much is a game compared to your monthly minimum wage in the UK?<br>
¡Saludos desde Colombia!<strong><br>
Sebas.</strong><br>
P.S: Please be sure to share some comment in Spanish, it would be great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hola Sebastián! According to <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/national-minimum-wage/">Money Saving Expert</a>, assuming a 35-hour work week, the monthly minimum wage in the UK works out to around £1850 right now. Using DK Bananza (£66.99, physical) as a recent example, that would be just over 3.5% of our monthly wage. That's before tax, mind you.</p>
<p>For me, I went digital almost exclusively on Switch 1, and those puny Switch cards could never compete with the majesty of a chunky N64 cart anyway, so for me physical hasn't been very magical for a while. The deep eShop sales and the convenience of having my library instantly accessible made sense to me on a portable system, and I don't regret it.</p>
<p>However, though I get the attraction of being able to resell, Game-Key Cards still feel like the absolute worst of all worlds to me, designed purely to benefit publishers and pass storage costs on to consumers. No me caen bien. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I'd go so far"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morning/afternoon/evening or whatever time you're reading this. (If you're reading this after midnight, respect to my fellow night owl).</p>
<p>Is it just me (probably not) that thinks that there are some games that are so so good that it's an absolute crime that they're not more well known? My personal example is the whole of the Blaster Master Zero trilogy. The writing is spot on, the gameplay is smooth and gets better throughout all three games, the trilogy leads up to a really satisfying and heartwarming, yet bittersweet conclusion that I'd go so far as to compare to Undertale.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>And it's a genuine shame that even after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDJSziIiD34">NovaZone's video on it on Youtube</a>, I haven't seen much more buzz about it. Best thing is, all three games together you can get for less than £30 even without a sale.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. And play Blaster Master Zero. That is all.<br>
<strong><em>Lewis Moore</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to you, Lewis, I get to trot out my semi-regular plug for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/just_shapes_and_beats">Just Shapes &amp; Beats</a>. Everyone should play that game. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"the main personalities"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So I noticed a long standing trend of Nintendo life staff adapting other writers' reviews for the video version. I understand that maybe the main personalities on Nintendo life can’t possibly play every major game thoroughly enough to put down their review, but the other issue I see is sometimes the video reviews come across like it’s your personally experience when it really isn’t. Or a reviewer puts in personal info into the review (eg. Mario Kart World) that doesn’t really make sense out of context. So my question - why not have these other reviewers also do the video version? Is it simply they aren’t as much of a personality or video reviews aren’t their thing? Thanks for answering!<br>
<strong><em>BFahey3</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For one, we've got a three-person YouTube team who earn their beans from making videos and whose expertise in that department outstrips everyone else on staff by a very wide margin. Capture cards and mics are the least of it - it's a different skillset, and while some of our writers may have the ability, Alex, Felix, and Zion have the know-how, gear, and camera charisma to deliver the best results in the speediest time.</p>
<p>And yes, some of us are just better in writing. Ask my wife. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"entertaining but useless"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good evening and tsufufum to you, NL,</p>
<p>Inspired by your recent nostalgic trip through the pages of NGC Magazine, I was compelled to do the same, taking about six weeks to chew my way through all 61 issues under the NGC banner. As I went through each issue, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oig6a5UFcypa8GO13yC-PHxOtb_ZO3w7U0tYzBsISGk/edit?usp=sharing">I compiled a spreadsheet of every review</a> featured so I could more easily refer back at a later date, and having now finished I am sharing this document in case it is useful to you as well.</p>
<p>Each review is listed with the issue it appears in and the score awarded, plus some feeble attempt from me to label the game with a genre. Of course, the real reason you read NGC is for their spectacular way with words, and a dry spreadsheet would be meaningless without paying heed to that, so I have also included snippets of many of the reviews in the manner of their (and your!) letters pages.</p>
<p>Also part of the document is a tab of "interesting" features. What counts as interesting obviously varies from one person to another so it's got a definite slant towards things I am interested in myself, but I've tried to highlight features that might also be of interest to the retro public at large... like the reported Pilotwings title being developed by Factor 5, and their repeated insistence that "Nintendo DS" was a temporary name. Oops!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Finally is a list of their fake games, seen as examples in features like their Directory. Often crass, they're mostly jabs at the various staff members who wrote the mag. This tab would probably be reviewed as "entertaining but useless".</p>
<p>I would encourage anyone with even a passing interest in the Gamecube-DS era to take a look into NGC. They were scrappy, chaotic and anarchic, far moreso than their contemporaries, and the magazine has a lot of personality as a result. It's also just fun to look back on old things that were new at the time and see how things have changed (and how they've stayed the same). Their speculation on what Mario's waterpumping backpack did, what Rare would do after Starfox Adventures, the inevitability of Wind Waker 2, and what Nintendo's "third pillar" would come to be, is all entertaining when read with the benefit of living in the future. At the very least, you'll learn some new words to call your friends.</p>
<p>I wonder if any NGC alumni are around and available for interview? I'd love to read some 20-years-later gossip about how things actually ran, if Greener regrets giving Melee 95% (he was right!), and if Shedwards still has his pigs. Not including that Ed guy, of course- he already works for NL.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the words, NL. You are the ship I jumped to when NGC sank, and I'm grateful that you in some manner keep that 100% Unofficial spirit alive.</p>
<p>Beebs<strong><br>
Babybahamut</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eyy, now you're speaking my language! N64 Magazine was my 'era' (and is the reason I'm here doing this today), with that talent and spirit flowing very directly into NGC, just as Super Play fed into N64. Thank you for this - and for the massive compliment.</p>
<p>Alumni-wise, I've had plans for something vaguely in this area for a long while now. It'll be a ways off, but keep the googly eyes peeled.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm off to play some Baldy's Pate. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"before the torches arrive"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, this probably won’t go well with NL readers, but we need to talk about Game Key cards. Is it necessary to complain about them every single time a new game is announced?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I understand the issue for game collectors and game preservation, but as a business practice it’s nothing new. Also, players across all platforms purchase far more digital games than physical these days.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>For those of us that have gone digital only for several years now, the constant complaint for Game Key cards feel similar to complaining about the lack of discs when new albums are released in Spotify or something.</p>
<p>I support you in your criticism of Game Key cards and I’ll keep reading the articles and watching the videos regardless if you mention Game Key or not. It just annoys me since I don’t agree that it’s as relevant to the average Nintendo gamer as the community makes it sound.</p>
<p>Now excuse me as I find somewhere to hide before the torches arrive. Thank you!<strong><br>
RenanKJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are rubbish, though, no?</p>
<p>Sure, it's irritating when people demand two points docked from a review score because Game Key-Card, as if modern games haven't been shipping with massive required downloads for a couple of generations. But if people want to voice their displeasure in a respectful manner, let's not crack out the copium just yet. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I expect more"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How long has Sakarai needed a break for? Everytime his name comes up, any YouTuber or Journalist or random comment poster will say "Ah give that guy a break, he's worked too much." Well guess what? He had his break. The last DLC for Super Smash Bros Ultimate was released in October 2021. So it's time we stopped cutting the guy slack, he's rested and ready and it's about time he made Kirby Air Riders and then about time he made another Smash Bros after that! He is only 55, so I expect more and I don't feel guilty saying so. So come on Sakurai, let's have some more games son!<strong><br>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>

<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158019/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>No one who has ever worked in retail would compare the experience to a cosy life management sim. I used to have nightmares about stock variance and queues of angry customers who seemed determined to ruin my day as much as they felt I had ruined theirs.</p>
<p>Yet, Danish developer Crinkle Cut Games seems to think that managing a busy supermarket is something people will enjoy doing on the couch or on the go. Thankfully, they wrapped a charming world around this premise, complete with a pixel art style and chill soundscape. Despite the hellish inspiration, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/discounty">Discounty</a> is almost good enough to be mentioned alongside genre luminaries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>, even though it doesn't do anything drastically different with the basic formula.</p>
<p>The story follows your created shopkeeper as they travel to the small town of Blomkest, where their aunt Tellar has been trying for years to get her franchise store off the ground. She believes your character, her newly arrived relative, is the key to building a thriving supermarket and tasks them with connecting trade across the community.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158020/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a fledgling store manager, you will order deliveries of various sundries and keep shelves stocked and organised. Once that open sign is flipped, the checkout needs to be manned and a steady flow of customers attended to. As items roll across the conveyor, you pull up a calculator to run price totals before checking orders out and seeing whether your customer service earns you an angry grumble or a delighted smile. A belt full of items can often screw up your calculations, and it doesn't help that the till UI is a bit fiddly.</p>
<p>Early on, the Discounty Corporation will introduce bonuses and performance reviews that reward stock variety and efficiency. Completing these challenges unlocks upgrades (like a till scanner to make your shift way easier), more types of produce and, as with any capitalist venture, more cash!</p>
<p>Much like ConcernedApe’s farming sim, Discounty draws you into a focused loop of familiar tasks before gradually expanding the world and involving you in the soap opera-like lives of the townspeople. Outside of work hours, you're free to wander Blomkest, exploring and chatting with the locals. Every aspect of the town ties back to the growth of your store in some way, whether through trade deals or side quests that open up new areas.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158022/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The cast is made up of mostly familiar archetypes, but there is still some amusing story content to enjoy. Early on, you will meet a crotchety fisherman with a grudge against the local cannery, who is monopolising his business. Other standouts include new age antique shop owner Solruna and little old lady Andersson. There’s also a mysterious tension between your aunt and the resident bureaucrat, Elmer. These little story vignettes are well written and often very funny.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about Discounty’s take on the cosy management sim is that it keeps the supermarket management front and centre. It’s a streamlined experience without the distractions of romance or extracurricular activities. Each customer has a series of story objectives to complete, but these usually amount to little more than finding someone and talking to them. Then it’s back to the shop floor to get (and sell) this bread.</p>
<p>For those who want to explore the generous depths of shop management with minimal distractions, this leaner format will be welcome. However, if you enjoyed the mini-games and love stories found in games like Stardew or the excellent (In my eyes, at least) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/graveyard_keeper">Graveyard Keeper</a>, you might be disappointed. The opportunity to automate a lot of the busywork is there, allowing you to spend more time exploring the town. However, there really isn’t much to do besides building up your store. It's a shame that <em>Crinkle Cut</em> chose to focus so heavily on shop management while cutting much of the side content that keeps games like this engaging over time.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158023/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The town of Blomkest both looks and sounds lovely. While the aesthetic is reminiscent of genre peers, Crinkle Cut has added its own visual spin. I especially liked the sense of motion in my shopkeeper’s bobbing head. The musical themes are good enough to cope with the strain of repetition and hum along to, as well. Special mention to the visceral sound effects in the shop, which may send former or current retail workers into a spiral.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Discounty is a solid addition to the Switch’s healthy stable of cosy sims. These games feel right at home on a console you can take anywhere, with a bite-sized day cycle that works just as well for long sessions as it does for quick breaks. Growing your supermarket is a deep and satisfying experience, but getting involved in your customers lives can be a bit shallow. But, most importantly, Discounty manages the impossible task of making retail work fun and relaxing, and that's a feat in itself.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d89a19f59ee34/super-adventure-island-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</a> for the GBA – a true classic and one of our favourites here at NL Towers. North America and Europe joined forced against Japan and, uh... Oh, poor Japan. The western design won with a whopping 91% of the vote! We quite like the Japanese design, there's definitely something to it. Though if you said it was boring, we wouldn't necessarily disagree. Hm.</p>
<p>Anyway, this week, we're going back to the SNES to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_adventure_island">Super Adventure Island</a>. Developed by Produce! and published by Hudson Soft in 1992, it boasted some really lovely, colourful visuals and the platforming gameplay was pretty decent.</p>
<p>It's a three-way brawl this week folks, so get ready to vote, vote, vote!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:16309 @ 1755456557 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/538a5c2430ae3/super-adventure-island-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so starting with North America, the artistic approach here is wildly different to that seen in Europe and Japan. After the initial whiplash, however, it's actually quite a cool image. More details become apparent the longer you look at it, like the characters in the background, the mine cart track swooping off into the distance, the 'leafy' title font... It's pretty cool.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a2a3a2c93c36/super-adventure-island-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So this one is a lot more, shall we say, 'cartoon-ish' than the North American variant. There are a handful of characters taking up the composition, including a couple of rather delightful turtles wearing shades. It's definitely a lot more colourful, although we'll have to dock a point for the rather boring title font.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8138a55c4a9c5/super-adventure-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Utilising the portrait orientation of the SNES packaging in Japan, this variant uses the same art style seen in Europe's design, but the added space allows for a lot more characters to be depicted. The giant skeleton thing on the right really draws the eye, and the use of colour is perhaps even more effective here.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-super-adventure-island-snes]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new update, bumping the game up to Version 21.0, an <a href="https://ninjalathegame.com/en/news/info/season21.html">official announcement</a> mentions how the team has decided Season 21 and the latest Ninjala Pass will "run indefinitely".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for playing Ninjala. The Ninjala Team has an announcement regarding the duration of Season 21.</p>
<p>In order to provide all Ninjala users with an enjoyable experience and stable service over the long term, we have decided Season 21 will run indefinitely.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yohrmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Accordingly, the Season 21 Ninjala Pass will also last indefinitely. We will still continue to hold various events such as WNA Tours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The servers for Ninjala <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjalaTheGame/comments/1mpvum3/season_21_ends_in_12_years/">apparently won't be going away</a> anytime soon. The title even received a Switch 2 compatibility update on 19th June 2025 - fixing some "previously identified issues".</p>
<p>This bubblegum ninja game was released for free on the Switch eShop in June 2020, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/ninjalas_release_gets_delayed_until_june_due_to_the_coronavirus_outbreak_gungho_president_apologises">after multiple delays</a>. When Ninjala was initially revealed, it was often compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a> – with GungHo's CEO Kazuki Morishita <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/06/ninjala_isnt_really_like_splatoon_but_wed_love_to_do_a_crossover_says_gungho_ceo">describing it as being "very different".</a></p>
<p>In our review of the game here on Nintendo Life around the time of its release, we awarded Ninjala seven out of ten stars.</p>
