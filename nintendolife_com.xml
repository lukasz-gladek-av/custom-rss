<p>One of the many new features of the Switch 2 is the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode ability. It's already been showcased within the launch window with new and old titles, and later this year, it will be available in Samus' first-person adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>If you are eager to warm up your FPS skills beforehand, it's been confirmed the new Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> this week has added mouse controls. Gyro controls are also apparently supported. Some players have already shared their thoughts about these control options – with <a href="https://x.com/TheEpicManWorld/status/1952956457181139286">some individuals pointing out</a> how you can swap between these controls on the fly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TheEpicMan: "What impressed me is that you can change from normal controls to mouse mode instantaneously! No need to go to the menu to turn it on or off!" (via social media)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from this, Apex Legends seems to have been well-received so far, although you'll need to make some space if you want to play it, as the title is over 78 GB on the Switch 2, according to the official eShop listing.</p>
<p>You can download Apex Legends for free on the Switch 2 (and Switch) and try out mouse mode right now. We've also got a Nintendo Life review for this game on the way, so be on the lookout for that. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> was also recently added to the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' service, and it also includes mouse support.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, there's apparently going to be a "playable" public demo of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>. It will be available next week at the <a href="https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us">Pokémon World Championships 2025</a> – taking place in Anaheim, California between <strong>15th - 17th August, 2025</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvlqwor&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Additionally, the same demo will be available to play at Gamescom a week later – between <strong>20th - 24th August 2025</strong>. We don't know the specifics about this demo just yet, or if there's any chance of a demo being made available on the eShop in the future, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Again, if there are interesting details or findings within this demo, we'll let you know. And if there are other demo locations announced, we'll give you the heads up. This follows the release of a new trailer for Pokémon Legends Z-A during the July Pokémon Presents, which gave fans a look at Mega Dragonite and much more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also released kiosks alongside the Switch 2 that feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-demo-spotted-in-the-wild">playable demos of games</a> like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Dead aim</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>I don’t think I’ve ever messed around with a game’s settings menu as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a>. And, unfortunately, try as I might, I could never get the game to feel 'good'. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">its predecessor</a> on the Switch, Forever Entertainment’s latest arcade revamp is limited to just two control schemes: analogue stick and gyro. Neither is an ideal way to play.</p>
<p>But let’s start with the positives. This is a remarkably faithful remake of the 1998 original, maintaining everything that makes the experience so memorable — including wacky boss battles and god-awful voice acting — while providing an extensive overhaul of the visuals. It’s a blast watching zombies’ limbs and guts go flying with each successful shot, and the way the enemy design has been revamped feels both fresh and respectful at the same time.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to get stuck into, including two versions of the campaign — original and arcade — a boss mode, and a training mode that throws you into a variety of challenges. These might entail protecting human NPCs or destroying barrels within a time limit, but it’s all useful in letting you get to grips with how the game plays on Switch.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, back to the control schemes. The gyro aiming, in theory, should be the way to go, but like the first remake, it’s way too erratic. Even when turning the sensitivity down in the settings, I could never hit that sweet spot. Either the reticle would fly off in random directions upon pressing the fire button, or it would inexplicably drift over to one side, requiring you to constantly recalibrate by moving it to the edge before recentring it.</p>
<p>Standard analogue controls feel more accurate, but again, it’s a monotonous exercise in tinkering with the sensitivity to find the setting that feels right. Spoiler: it never felt quite right. Even after landing on a setting that felt reasonably comfortable, the very nature of using an analogue cursor in a light gun game feels incredibly unintuitive. The fact that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/house_of_the_dead_2and3_return">2008 port for the Wii</a> feels better is quite saddening, to say the least.</p>
<p>I should note that the game isn’t horrifically unplayable or anything like that. It’s perfectly serviceable, but a light gun shooter should be instantly playable and fun, and having to constantly fiddle around with the settings to achieve something close to satisfying is definitely frustrating. It's something that developer MegaPixel Studio really should have rectified from the first Switch remake.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I <em>am</em> glad The House of the Dead 2: Remake exists. Control woes aside, I suspect many players will eventually find some enjoyment from the game, provided you're willing to spend considerable time in the settings menu beforehand. It's a fascinating blast from the past, warts 'n' all, and a real showcase of some truly terrible voice acting from the '90s. Just make sure you toggle the 'Mute "Reload!" Scream' option – good lord.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9824329e3a075/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the moment Nintendo revealed Pauline's presence in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I knew one thing for certain: I was going to be writing a feature on the DK timeline in the next two months.</p>
<p>Look, you know I love Bananza. DK and Pauline have such a wholesome little relationship, I adored hearing the same senile rant from Cranky on each and every layer, and the little nods to the great ape's previous endeavours were perfectly balanced. It felt like a wall-to-wall celebration of all things DK while also serving as an introduction to the modern age of 3D platforming for one of Nintendo's oldest characters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4lhzyxv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then the ending happened. It's a wonderful set piece that I played with the biggest, cheesiest smile on my face, but it, along with the mere presence of a 13-year-old Pauline, throws up a lot of questions about where Bananza sits in the wider canon, and let's be honest here, DK doesn't need that.</p>
<p>If you've stayed with me this far and you think there's a chance I'll make it through the next 800 words without spoiling the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, you are very much mistaken. I'll be talking about the final sequence of Donkey Kong Bananza in depth. Heck, there might even be some screenshots thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>If you don't want that spoiling (and I'd really recommend seeing it fresh for yourself — it's awesome), then wrap up your reading here and only scroll past the following image when you've seen everything for yourself, <strong>as there are major spoilers below</strong>.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ece8c9c5bafeb/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>3, 2, 1... right, that's it, I'm unpeeling things — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where was I? Ah yes, the ending!</p>
<p>The final stage of Donkey Kong Bananza finally sees DK and Pauline get back to the latter's home turf on the surface, which is... New Donk City! Yep, the very one seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. There's some more platforming and a boss fight (I've broken it all down in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-ending-explained-is-it-a-prequel-to-mario-odyssey">Ending Explained guide</a>, if you need reminding of the deets), but the tl;dr of it is that NDC returns to its rot-free glory, DK returns to the mines — <a href="https://youtu.be/wJO_vIDZn-I?si=_2rCxvy25prEHc_s&amp;t=4">like Steve, he yearns for them</a> — and Pauline gets to live out her dreams of singing in front of the whole city. Hmm.</p>
<p>That last note got under my skin when I first played through the grand finale, and I haven't been able to shake it in the weeks since. This is <em>Pauline</em>. This is <em>New Donk City</em>. This is <em>singing</em>. Nintendo could have played the riff from 'Jump Up, Superstar!' over the entire sequence, and it wouldn't have made it any more obvious that the game is going, "Look, it's just like that 2017 3D Mario game!! See??"</p>
<p>All these threads come together in a great big Odyssey-shaped signpost, actively encouraging us all to think about the prized plumber's previous platforming exploits and start to question where Bananza fits in around it.</p>
<p>And think about it I did. I was so ready for Bananza to end with Pauline saying something like, "You know what my <em>real</em> dream is, DK? To be mayor of this great city!," but it doesn't. Instead, it ends with an image of a very-much-still-13-years-old Pauline singing on the roof of City Hall (after the post-credits missions, that is), and all of those references to her grandma — which she's been banging on about throughout the game, let's not forget — ringing in your ears.</p>

<p>This isn't the Odyssey prequel that I thought it would be, but instead a <em>sequel</em>. Another child in the Pauline family tree (also called 'Pauline', confusingly), learning to love the giant ape that had caused so much drama for her ancestors. <em>Aw</em>.</p>
<p>No! Not "<em>Aw</em>"! This is exactly why I started this piece in the first place. I have put too much thought and energy into a timeline that, let's admit it, is a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on Cranky Kong. We all know that this elderly ape is <em>the</em> DK from the original arcade machine (it's even referenced in one of his Bananza speeches), so what's he doing <em>still</em> up and about all these years later? And what about his son, Donkey Kong Jr? Are we just going to assume that vest-wearing chimp faded away as he headed back to his home planet?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I can get behind a BS timeline. I know the <strong>Zelda</strong> one more than most and actually enjoy slotting things into it. But at least <strong>Hyrule Historia</strong> is based loosely (and I mean <em>loosely</em>) on the games' narrative events and not solely on "how old is this kid now, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong timeline — or, casting the net even wider in this instance, a <em>Mario</em> timeline — is a fool's errand right from the jump because there's almost no narrative to hang things on. Nobody is saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> <em>has</em> to come after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/dk_king_of_swing">DK: King of Swing</a> because you can see DK still riding the high of the Jungle Jam Festival".</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11871822b222/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And I really want to hammer this home, I <em>love</em> Donkey Kong Bananza, I just don't think that good things necessarily need to be strung up to other good things. I should be relishing in the glow of post-Bananza joy, but instead I'm getting myself wound up over lore that didn't exist until a month ago.</p>
<p>If we're going to keep pretending that the narrative events of DK or Mario matter to the wider pantheon of Nintendo games, at least give us a nicely bound lore book to add to the coffee table. The DK Dictionary? Kong Kompilation? Gorilla Glossary?... I'll work on it.</p>

<p><em>What do you make of DKB's finale and how it ties into the wider Mario pantheon? Do you want to see more of this shared world-building, or are the games best left as stand-alones?
