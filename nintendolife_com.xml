<figure><a title="Date Everything" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6454690e91558/date-everything.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team17</em></figcaption></figure><p>We had a lot of respect for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/date_everything">Date Everything</a> when it arrived on Switch earlier this year. This bonkers dating sim boasted a monster voice cast with portfolios spanning <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Persona</strong>, <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and more, but it was let down by some heartbreaking performance issues. Fortunately, the latest Switch update — which developer Sassy Chap Games calls a "mega patch" — should clear some of that up.</p>
<p>The latest update bundles three previous hotfixes into one bug break-up package. Those bugs have clearly been the target of this one, with the "mega patch" fixing a lot of issues in the game's multiple endings, and adding an overall performance boost to the Switch version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<figure><a title="NES Cartridges" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59c39a7c0f293/nes-cartridges.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Former Capcom and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter II</a> producer Yoshiki Okamoto has been sharing insights into his time working on games for the NES / Famicom over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmUsHUltVQ&amp;ab_channel=%E5%B2%A1%E6%9C%AC%E5%90%89%E8%B5%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0ch">his YouTube channel</a>, and it gives us an interesting glimpse at game development at the time.</p>
<p>Translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-veteran-says-nintendo-was-the-only-one-making-steady-revenue-from-nes-game-carts-capcoms-profits-really-took-off-with-the-ps1/">Automaton Media</a>, Okamoto detailed that it was harder for third-party developers such as Capcom and retailers to actually turn a profit making and selling games for the Famicom. And, from his experience, "only Nintendo had a guaranteed profit."</p>
<p>"Let’s say a Famicom cartridge sold for 10,000 yen at retail. Out of that, 3,000 yen went to the retailer. 4,000 yen went to the software developer, like Capcom, and 3,000 yen went to Nintendo," which sounds okay at first glance, but Okamoto clarifies that "Out of Nintendo’s 3,000 yen share, about 1,500 went to manufacturing contractors."</p>
<p>"Since Nintendo got paid upfront for the exact number of copies, manufactured the cartridges, and delivered them, what happened after that didn’t matter to them." Back in the '80s, Capcom was a relatively new developer, and had to pay around 3,000 yen per unit upfront.</p>
<figure><a title="NES cartridge profits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2fe46539a22f7/nes-cartridge-profits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmUsHUltVQ&amp;ab_channel=%E5%B2%A1%E6%9C%AC%E5%90%89%E8%B5%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0ch">Yoshiki Okamoto</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This resulted in the company taking out bank loans to ensure it could afford to pay the Big N, but this built up over time, as it apparently took Nintendo up to 3 months to supply cartridges. Then, Capcom had to send those cartridges and invoices to distributors, but it would rarely get paid immediately, instead receiving a promissory notice to say the money would be coming in 3 months.</p>
<p>That meant, often, that any profit would take up to 6 months to reach Capcom, which would likely be spent on clearing those bank loans. Okamoto also talks about unsold cartridge stock, where developers would often have leftovers thanks to having to over-order, as production took around 3 months. That adds another 3,000 yen unit to costs.</p>
<p>Okamoto still stresses that the NES and SNES were worth it for Capcom, despite cartridges "really only" benefitting Nintendo — and you only have to look at Street Fighter II sales figures to see that.</p>
<p>So, while cartridge-based systems, costs were higher — and that's still true today, from what we know — so when the PlayStation was announced, and disc manufacturing costs were cheaper, it was a dream for third-parties.</p>

<p>“Capcom’s profits skyrocketed with the switch from cartridges to discs,” Okamoto tells viewers, stating that not only were manufacturing costs cheaper, but that Sony would also return its share of the pay (1,600 yen of the 1,800 paid, for example) if Capcom returned any unsold CDs.</p>
<p>Faster restocking speeds, allowing devs to respond much quicker to sale spikes and interests, meant that Capcom was able to thrive even more in the disc-based era. But Nintendo was still a huge part of its success because it allowed them to grow their player base <em>and</em> get a foot in the door in the console gaming space.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating look at how video game development worked back in the late '80s and early '90s, and yet another look at why the PS1 did as well as it did. Who knows how different things would be with that Sony disc add-on for the SNES...</p>

<figure><a title="Elden Ring" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e80359f0f02d0/elden-ring.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-tomorrow-31st-july-2025">a new Nintendo Direct coming very soon</a>, and it's a Partner Showcase, which means it's time for third parties to shine.</p>
<p>Since launch, we've seen some big hitters from publishers like Capcom (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>), CD Projekt (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>), and SEGA (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>), but despite a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">very solid lineup</a> at launch, you get the feeling that Nintendo has kept the floodgates closed to give early releases time to breathe.</p>
<p>However, with 25 minutes to fill, it looks like that's about to change. We're expecting big news, including release dates for previously announced games (hi there, FromSoft), but also a handful of surprises - or not-quite-surprises-but-exciting-all-the-sames. (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nis-accidentally-reveals-upcoming-switch-2-game-sparking-even-more-direct-speculation">And that one NIS itself apparently leaked.</a>)</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll at the bottom what you expect to see pop up (and leave a comment with other suggestions/wild dreams). First, though, let's take a look at Team NL's third-party predictions for upcoming Direct...</p>
<h2>Nine, Nine, NINE (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="UFO 50" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d3531e2ea8d1/ufo-50.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mossmouth</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Me being who I am, my thoughts immediately darted to the handful of RPGs that haven’t got release dates yet – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> – but I think this is the place to announce something new. Not just a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> port (which is <em>probably</em> coming; it’s on everything else).</p>
<p>Nope, I’m sticking my neck out, because it’s time to announce that darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake. Stop teasing me with new art and new merchandise; give me a reimagining of my favourite Final Fantasy game right now.</p>
<p>I think we’ll <em>probably</em> get a bit of indie coverage too; I’d love to see more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, perhaps a cheeky little <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/steam/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> surprise. And hey, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a>’s final release date? It just had what is supposed to be its final patch. A date can’t be far off now.</p>
<p>Once again, I <em>refuse</em> to say the game with the initials <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">HK:S</a>. I want it, badly, though. But I can’t be disappointed this way.</p>
<h2>Ports and Puzzlers (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1f79560e1f33/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, let me brush off my book of 'Switch Ports Plz' that I've been building for the past five years and see what jumps out, starting with some recent biggies that I think <em>could</em> be likely.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> have the 'huge-following-meets-unexpected-smash-hit-release' factor in them that makes me think a speedy Switch 2 version could be on the cards. Let's throw <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_3_reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> into there too — nothing unexpected about that one, but there's no way that it doesn't come our way eventually.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I'm still holding out hope for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvels_midnight_suns">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>. Remember when that was definitely 100% coming to Switch before it just... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/marvels-midnight-suns-on-switch-no-longer-planned">quietly didn't</a>? Marvel could do with a little goodwill at the moment, and this would be one hell of a way to do it. Slot it in before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Cosmic Invasion</a> and <em>boom</em>, you've got a Fall/Winter double bill.</p>
<p>The puzzler in me is still begging for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/witness">The Witness</a> — which seems less likely every year — but a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> port feels like a no-brainer after the stellar launch a few months back, and I'd happily turn a blind eye to that 60+ hour PS5 playtime to start again on Switch 2.</p>
<p>And you know I can't touch on puzzlers without mentioning my beloved Hershel. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> is due out <em>this year</em> and we still don't have as much as a release window. C'mon, Level-5, don't break me.</p>

<p>I'm very excited about this Direct. I wanna see a strong lineup of games stretching into Xmas now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is old news. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>? Ancient history. Give me a few big third-party heavy hitters, (most of which the team has already mentioned here, but I'll double down on wanting to see more Hades 2 details, alongside Clair Obscur, Elden Ring, and Blue Prince).</p>
<p>I'd love to see some oldies revamped. Give me <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/vanquish">Vanquish</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, y'know, the S-Tier stuff. More likely, I reckon we could see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> show up, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resi remake</a> games — some of which have appeared in cloud form — could perhaps see actual ports. Besides these, give me a Metaphor ReFantazio port with bonus Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p>I reckon we'll get everything I just typed out. So I might as well throw a port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metal_gear_solid_delta_snake_eater">Metal Gear Delta: Snake Eater</a> in for good measure.</p>
<h2>Microsoft announcing something other than layoffs and AI guff (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>

<p>Xbox Game Studios has been quiet about Switch 2 despite plans to expand its software catalogue to anything that'll play it. I've wanted <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/rare_replay">Rare Replay</a> on a Nintendo system for years, and it feels like a better fit now than ever. More likely we'll see the rumoured <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/sea_of_thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> port, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_6">Call of Duty</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">promised Switch debut</a>, and something else - a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_5">Forza Horizon</a> potentially, or perhaps <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">Indy</a> shows up on Switch following his PS5 appearance. Some good news out of Microsoft, for once.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the team has covered the bases, loads of good stuff up there. But Alana mentioned my personal 'most wanted' - I've been jonesing for UFO 50 on Switch since it launched on PC, and I'd imagine Switch 2's extra grunt would help in the port department.</p>
<p>Aside from all the expected ports, a handful of exclusives would be lovely, too - or at least some new all-platform announcements. Nothing against Switch 2 ports (the more, the merrier), but after years of 'Yay, a fuzzier, portable version of a game everyone else played years ago,' some freshness wouldn't go amiss while Switch 2's still got that new system smell.</p>

<p>Brand new Fusion system detailed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Marvelous has released two brand new gameplay videos for its upcoming sci-fi mech action game sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>.</p>
<p>The pair of trailers cover the action RPG's all-new fusion system alongside further info on its heavy armour sets. And it looks like the new fusion system in particular is something that should have returning fans excited.</p>
<p>You can also check out the heavy armour video at the bottom of this article, and we gotta say with all this drip-feeding of new info, anyone who's even remotely interested in big robot fighting fun-times should perhaps be getting a bit hot under the metal collar right about now.</p>

<p>Here's some further deets from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Fusion System:</strong></em></p>
<p>Abandon your humanity and gain power! The Fusion system allows the player to fuse Immortal factors, obtained from defeated enemies, into their bodies to acquire powerful abilities useful in combat. Factors are based on three categories: Might, Shell, and Skeleton, which determine the types of skills that can be acquired. The more Immortal Factors an Outer fuses to their body, the more skills they will have access to, while also mutating their body into something inhuman. Outers can restore their human appearance for a fee and the greater cost of losing all their new skills. The choice of whether that power is worth losing yourself along the way can only be made by you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Heavy Armor:</strong></em></p>
<p>Turn the tide of battles! The new, more agile Arsenal isn’t the only suit you’ll get to pilot in Titanic Scion. Customizable Heavy Armor can be summoned when the call gauge is full to deliver powerful attacks. Heavy armor, combined with robust weaponry and a strong defense strategy, can turn a losing battle into victory.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>A Titanic Evolution - Daemon X Machina’s high-octane armored action debuts on a new generation of platforms, bringing with it an epic sci-fi adventure, gameplay that’s accessible to newcomers, and an expanded scope sure to satisfy returning fans.<br>
Build a Better You - Now a nimble suit of armor, each Arsenal can be fully customized both in design and in loadout, with the ability to craft or salvage new elements.<br>
Together You Can Make a Difference - Cooperative and asynchronous multiplayer means players never truly fight alone. Team up with friends online to tackle the epic story and battles together.<br>
Beautiful and Deadly - Explore an alien planet in an Arsenal as players battle against mechanical and organic enemies. Trek through the vast open world on foot, fly through the skies, or when all else fails, gallop on horseback across plains, swamps, mountains, and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion, is due to launch for Nintendo Switch 2 on Sept. 5, 2025, and we are excited about it!</p>
