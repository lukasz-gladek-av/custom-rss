<p>Could a certain series make a return?</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0ffb89a1c456/super-mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of Mario's 40th anniversary this week, NBCUniversal has apparently registered multiple 'Super Mario Galaxy Movie' domain names.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Direct broadcast is obviously taking place later today, and <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">this recent discovery has now led to speculation</a> about the title and theme of the upcoming movie and even future Mario movies. It seems to have also reignited hopes for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game entries to make a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>At this stage, nothing has been officially announced, so there's no guarantee these newly discovered registrations will lead to any confirmations or reveals.</p>

<p>There are also some theories floating around about this potentially being an <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">attempt to "throw" fans off the trail</a>. In saying this, it's still generating plenty of buzz being so close to Super Mario's anniversary and the latest Direct presentation. Adding some fuel to the fire is a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1966261624622416067">rumoured 'Old Spice' product leak</a> from earlier this year, which featured character renders as well as a title logo for 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie'.</p>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/super-mario-world-looks-to-be-the-official-name-of-the-next-mario-movie">finding in May on the official NBCUniversal website</a>, which suggested the next Mario Movie (due out in April 2026) would be titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>. However, the same web page removed the reference to this movie title not long after the news began circulating online.</p>
<p>When the follow up Mario Movie was originally announced in March 2024, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at the time how it would be "based on the world of the Super Mario Bros. series".</p>

<p>It's been a busy year for Nintendo and to help with all of the announcements in March of this year it released its very own new-style mobile app.</p>
<p>Nintendo Today! has been updated multiple times since its release, but today's update is arguably the best one yet. It adds a new Kirby theme, additional language support and also some other handy features.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes, courtesy of the app's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-today/id6736725704">Apple Store page</a>:</p>
<h3>Version History</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>2.0</h4>
Sep 12, 2025
<p>- The Kirbyâ„¢ theme has been added.</p>
<p>- Additional languages are supported: English (European), Spanish (European), Korean, and Traditional Chinese.</p>
<p>- The app is now available in South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lym5i3t32i2k">highlighted by OatmealDome on social media</a>, this update also includes some "special features" for the upcoming Nintendo Live 2025 Tokyo event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Special features were also added for Nintendo Live 2025 TOKYO attendees. Interestingly, the app verifies that you are physically present in the venue and locks the features if you are not. It does this by listening for an inaudible sound-wave signal that is broadcast inside."</p>

<p>Mojang has reconfirmed its next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Live broadcast of 2025 will be returning later this month on 27th September.</p>
<p>This show will provide an update on vanilla Minecraft - including "fresh info" from the developers, the inside scoop on unannounced game drops, and much more. This will then be followed by a "Deep Dig After Show", where the team dives into the new features and content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Minecraft LIVE is our own super special show that gives you the inside info on everything happening in the world of Minecraft!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll be able to watch this broadcast via minecraft.net, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and TikTok.</p>
