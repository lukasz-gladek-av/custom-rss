Hold up now folks, don't get too excited, sit yourselves down.</p>
<p>As described in the official patch notes (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-today-2-4-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the new widget is a "compact size equivalent to four icons", so it's not going to take up a massive chunk of space on your home screen. Naturally, all you need to do is update the app via the Play Store/App Store, and you'll be good to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added a new size to the calendar widget.<br>
- We’ve added a compact size equivalent to four icons to the daily rotating calendar widgets featuring various characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong>Tomodachi Life</strong> can now be selected as a game series you're interested in. To do this, navigate to your account settings screen on the bottom right, tap on 'Home', then 'Your Favourite Characters/Game Series'.</p>
<p>With the impending release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>, this might be a good way to keep up to date on minor announcements or videos. Of course, we'll be covering any larger announcements right here on Nintendo Life too.</p>

<p>Ranked Battle Season 7 kicks off on <strong>19th February</strong> and will be sticking around until <strong>12th March</strong>. The big reward this time is a Blazikenite Mega Stone — dished out to all those who reach Rank S — which you can use to Mega Evolve your Blaziken.</p>
<p>Once again, Mega Stone rewards from previous seasons will make a return this time around, with Swampertite, Sceptillite, Baxcalibrite, Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite and Greninjite available as rewards from Rank T-Y.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7rpwuso&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the exact time that Season 7 will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 10pm (Wed) PST / 11pm (Wed) MST / 12am CST / 1am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 6am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 7am CET / 8am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 5pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As ever, there are some Pokédex restrictions on which 'mon you can take into battle with you in Season 7. Just like last time, only Pokémon numbered 001-232 in the Lumiose 'dex and 001-132 in the Hyperspace 'dex will be allowed to compete, all of which will be set to level 50 for the duration of the battle. Oh yes, and you can only stick one Restricted Legendary Pokémon on your bench, too — so no super teams, okay?</p>
<p>As we say, there are still a few days of Season 6 remaining before all this kicks off. You'll find everything you need to know about the current event (and all those that came before it) in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-battles-all-seasons-and-rewards">Ranked Battle guide</a> below.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5880f3ba02a93"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5880f3ba02a93/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>This March, Pokémon is expanding beyond its usual battle roots with a brand-new game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> that seems to include a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>If the information and trailers shared about the game haven't already sold you, maybe the previews will. Here's what our staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say about this upcoming Pokémon title, and below this, you can see what other sites said, based on their own hands on impressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations, Pokopia was a huge surprise... It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkrpowg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57586-hands-on-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-the-series-coziest-game-yet">GoNintendo</a>: "It’s hard to predict whether or not a Pokémon spinoff will turn into something beloved or have a real lasting impact, but I think Pokopia has what it takes to get there. It provides an opportunity for fans to interact with some of their favorite creatures in a very different, more relaxed way, without a battle in sight. Die-hard Pokémon fans and anyone who’s become enamored with cozy life sims over the last few years should keep Pokémon Pokopia"</p>

That's all it took to convince me that Pokemon Pokopia is going to take over my life. This cozy, Animal Crossing-flavored take on my favorite creature-collecting series is packing a real punch – moreish exploration, building, and collection mechanics combined with delightful personality and a generous dose of feel-good: even from a short preview session, this is a game I can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into."</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a>: "Put simply, this is <em>Pokémon</em> meets <em>Minecraft</em>, with a delightfully goofy premise and the potential for lots of town-building fun to be had either by yourself or with a group of friends via online play."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-preview-hands-on-best-entry-years-731895-20260211">Gamingbible</a>: "I barely feel as if I’ve scratched the surface of discovering what <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> has to offer and yet, I’m entirely sold on its vision. This isn’t simply a formulaic cosy game with a Pokémon overlay. It’s a really wonderfully considered creation that’s as accessible to diehard fans as it is to complete and utter novices. I haven’t stopped thinking about <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> ever since I heard the dreaded words “time’s up”, so I certainly know what I’ll be picking up come 5 March."</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/11/gotta-house-em-all">Game Informer</a>: "Pokémon spin-offs are very hit or miss for me, but after playing a bit of Pokopia, my gut says this one will be a hit. It balances the aesthetic and accessibility of Pokémon with open-ended, relaxed mechanics found in cozy simulation games, and it does so without feeling boring or overly simple. I'm looking forward to playing the final product when it launches in just a few weeks."</p>

<p>In case you missed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">the announcement last month</a>, Nintendo is releasing its first new Joy-Con 2 colours for the Switch 2 this week.</p>

<p>Apart from the subtle colour change, these controllers are exactly the same as the ones that come with the Switch 2. In other words, they use the same magnetic connectors, support HD rumble, and each one can be used as a mouse in compatible games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The updated Joy-Con 2 controllers have easy-to-use motion controls and HD rumble 2, along with the new C Button for easy GameChat* access and all-new mouse controls in compatible games.</p>
<p>"This set includes both a left and right Joy-Con 2 controller, along with a pair of Joy-Con 2 straps, perfect for local multiplayer with a friend in compatible games."</p>

<p>If you plan on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> on the Switch 2 this week, be ready for a day one update bumping the new software up to Version 1.0.1.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68671">official patch notes</a> on Nintendo's support page, the development team has apparently addressed "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience". However, it doesn't specify what exactly has been updated. If we find out what has changed, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Perhaps, more importantly, this launch update is required to access the game's Switch Online features. Once you've updated to this version, you'll no longer be able to play locally or via LAN with older versions of the game - so make sure you are running the same update when playing together with family and friends.</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932uoxzhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As our reviewer PJ O'Reilly mentioned in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever review</a>, the main adventure mode is a bit of a letdown, and solo players don't have a lot of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come. So you'll want to get online play up and running!</p>
