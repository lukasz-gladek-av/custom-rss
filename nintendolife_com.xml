<p>"The Wildest Adventure of Them All!" returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Limited Run Games has announced that it's bringing NES side-scrolling platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/little_samson">Little Samson</a> to the Switch in 2026. The reveal took place during the company's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK5Ow9zHA4U">10th anniversary stream</a>.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1992 for the NES and directed by former Capcom designer Shinichi Yoshimoto (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/strider">Strider</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ghouls_n_ghosts">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a>), Little Samson sees you controlling one of four characters — the eponymous Samson, a dragon called Kikira, the golem Gamm, or a mouse called K.O.</p>
<p>Each character controls a little differently and has different abilities — Kikira can breathe fire, for example, while Samson can climb walls and throw bells. Outside of the first four stages, which act like tutorials, you can swap which character you control at any point during the game. There are 20 stages to beat, with a true final boss that's only accessible if you beat the game on Normal difficulty.</p>

<p>In more recent years, Little Samson has become something of a collector's item. It's infamously one of the more-expensive NES games out there, with copies going for hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars online.</p>
<p>Well, now that won't be a problem, as Limited Run Games' Carbon Engine port will make it more accessible to all. Amazingly, we actually asked LRG's Josh Fairhurst about Little Samson when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/how-limited-runs-new-engine-respects-the-legacy-of-classic-games">we interviewed them way back in 2022</a>, and here's what he had to say then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s super high on games I want to do but no one knows where the rights are. We reached out to Taito and they said “They might be with the owner.” So we found the owner (who was really hard to find) and he said “I don’t know who has the rights.” So now we’re basically at a dead end. Who has the rights to Little Samson? No idea."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're glad the team made something work!</p>
<p>Though it's worth highlighting that Limited Run Games has come under fire in recent months due to delays on physical products, some items being below-standard, and NES cartridges that may damage your console. Josh also spoke to our sister site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-werve-certainly-made-mistakes-limited-runs-boss-on-winning-back-the-trust-of-the-community">Time Extension more recently about those issues</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="85a947ad7c8ab"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/85a947ad7c8ab/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the weekend, we republished our reader-ranked list of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time">all the Pokémon games</a> after everyone had had a chance to spend some quality time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-what-review-score-would-you-give-pokemon-legends-z-a">vote accordingly</a>.</p>
<p>That's 22 mainline games by our count. The entries at the top of the table probably won't surprise you, as the inventiveness and sheer novelty (and nostalgia) of earlier entries dominate the higher ranks, although it may surprise you to see OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red/Blue</a>/<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_yellow_version_special_pikachu_edition">Yellow</a> outside the top 10.</p>
<p>However, scrolling down from low to high, one thing becomes immediately obvious: the Switch generation hasn't been a great one for Pokémon.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59kiywrp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The Pokémon Company's accountants would beg to differ, I'm sure. ZA <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-scored-us-biggest-physical-game-launch-since-totk">reportedly</a> turned in the biggest physical launch figures in the US since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and it's gone down similarly well in Japan. The UK and European launches seem to have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/uk-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-smallest-retail-launch-since-lets-go-in-europe">a mite less enthusiastic</a>, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-pokemon-legends-z-a">the critical reception</a> was positive, and the game is rocking a "Generally Favourable" Metascore of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/">78</a> on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch">76</a> on Switch 1.</p>
<p>And yet, with nearly 500 NL user ratings at the time of writing, there it languishes at the very bottom of our Pokémon list.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:79484 @ 1761774782 -->
<figure data-uuid="61fc2aec9fbed"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61fc2aec9fbed/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's an odd one. Recency bias can present the opposite issue when a fervent fanbase is all-in on the new hotness, but after an initial period, we find things settle down nicely. Yes, it turns out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> really are all-timers that deserve their spots at (or near) the very, very top of their rankings. We've had it so good with other Nintendo series since 2017, which makes all these Switch Pokémon games in the nosebleeds stand out all the more.</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll always have extremes with reader-voted polls: some will slap on an 'Outstanding' 10/10 to try and elevate their favourites; others will troll games they've taken against with a 1/10 to knock them down a peg. (Seriously, the five people currently rating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet</a> 'Abysmal' need to have a word with themselves, but that's another article.) But bombers and bootlickers and genuine outlier opinions aside, a good sample size soon balances things out and games settle into their groove.</p>
<p>And there's no getting around it: the consensus shows a paucity of truly great, recent Pokémon games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Sword and Shield</a> sits at #18, followed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee</a> at #19, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Diamond and Pearl</a> remakes at #20, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a> slotting in just before ZA at the bottom.</p>
<p>The exception is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> at #5; a game which dared to try something a <em>little</em> different, blending nostalgia for a past generation with some innovative touches — for Pokémon, at least — and hinting at a bright future if Game Freak dared to be different.</p>

<p>It's worth clarifying that none of the Switch Pokémon games are straight-up bad. The average score from nearly 500 NL readers currently stands at 7.0, coincidentally bang on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Alana's 7/10 review score</a>. As per our own scoring rubric, it's patently a 'Good' game.</p>
<p>But is 'Good' or 'Generally Favourable' sufficient for one of the most beloved series in all of video games? Imagine the headlines, the think pieces, the <em>confusion</em> if Nintendo fumbled the next 3D Mario and it settled on a Metascore in the late 70s. It's possible, but also, somehow, unthinkable. Would Koizumi even let it out the door if he thought someone could give it a 4 with a straight face? 'Good' doesn't cut it for the greatest series.</p>
<p>Yet it seems that, at some point, we've gotten used to 'good enough' from Pokémon, a sorry state for a series that fires up such formative passions. When did it happen?</p>
<p>I remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X &amp; Y</a> launching without support for the 3DS' namesake, flagship feature. Was that it? I don't think so. Rarely has a Pokémon game been a visual tour de force, and that game was genuinely great. No, that wasn't it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6de7165e83781"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6de7165e83781/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Alex Olney / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sword and Shield felt like a very safe first step into a new realm, although in that context, as the first home-console entry, Game Freak still had the benefit of the doubt. No, no, the <em>next</em> one will be the big one...</p>
<p>Not that one. Or that one. Hmm. Look, maybe Gen 10 is when they'll really bring out the big guns, Timmy.</p>
<p>The Pokémon fanbase extends far beyond the games, of course, so you're not relying on the near-annual mainline schedule for your Pokémon fix. However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/pokemon-tcg-community-engulfed-in-potential-fraud-scandal">discord in the physical TCG sphere</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-one-year-on-every-positive-pokemon-tcg-pocket-update-still-comes-with-a-catch">dissatisfaction</a> with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pocket</a> version, in particular, have seen the fanbase become more vocally unhappy than ever. Throw in major disappointment around Scarvi's performance (which, for the record, performs much better on Switch 2 - it only took two-and-a-half years and totally new hardware!) and it feels like Pokémon stories come in just four flavours: 'random 'mon distribution in Game X', '<em>OMG terrible tech!!1</em>', 'scandalous card-pack prices', and 'crossover merch'.</p>

<p>Given the series' success, the dev resources allocated are a popular discussion topic, too. If Pokémon is the biggest franchise on the planet, why isn't The Pokémon Company putting Naughty Dog-level budgets on these games? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-z-as-source-code-and-beta-builds-have-now-supposedly-leaked">A recent (still-unverified) leak</a> of various Pokémon-related material <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-franchise-budget-leak-game-freak-nintendo-switch-graphics/">reportedly suggests</a> that Scarlet and Violet's budget was $21.8 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4632c24f7ec23"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4632c24f7ec23/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, many a small developer would kill for a budget like that, but for games that sell <em>this</em> well, a budget of $22 million is modest compared to many AAA games on other consoles. Perhaps there's something there: whatever triple-A means exactly in 2025, Pokémon...just isn't. Has it ever been?</p>
<p>Modern Pokémon's problem is a lack of ambition. Say what you like about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>, but it injected something totally fresh and captivating. And it did so nearly a decade ago, eight months before Switch launched. I gave myself an RSI playing that in Hong Kong, such was the curiosity and joy it inspired, the ol' surprise and delight. <em>[insert tasteless joke about more recent Pokémon games inspiring personal injury of a different nature here]</em></p>
<p>TPC giving the mainline series a breather last year felt like tacit acknowledgement that they'd made too many trips to the well and had come back with a muddy bucket. A year to regroup seemed prudent to prevent an MCU-style glut of product and waning enthusiasm.</p>
<figure data-uuid="634de2828d339"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/634de2828d339/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But is enthusiasm <em>actually</em> waning for Pokémon? ZA's early sales figures suggest 'nope', although speaking to the NL team, there's a general sentiment which doesn't bode well. A sampling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Modern entries try to convey a sense of freedom, yet constantly stop you in your tracks to explain something excruciatingly simple step-by-step. They've lost that sense of discovery."</p>
<p>"I’m always more excited to boot up Ruby/Sapphire or Black/White than the latest entry — and I think that’s because I always need to clarify the newbies with a “Yeah, it’s pretty rough, <em>but</em>…” to justify my enjoyment."</p>
<p>"There are no surprises anymore."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then again, we're not kids anymore; naturally, they're the franchise focus. There's an influx of fresh players every generation, and no impetus for TPC to push the envelope when the base proposition of catching 'em all is still so addictive and profitable. Candy doesn't go out of fashion, does it? We're not kicking down doors at Cadbury's or Hershey's demanding they reinvent chocolate.</p>
<p>But just contrast this to Nintendo's own approach to Mario. Just the other day, we saw <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/shigeru-miyamoto-is-confident-mario-will-be-around-for-a-long-time-to-come">Nintendo luminaries stressing</a> that Mario will only survive if his games evolve and the developers continue to innovate. What's the last mainline Mario game that surprised me? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Wonder</a>, probably. The last one. Perhaps to a fault (<em>"Okay, what's <strong>this</strong> zany Wonder Flower going to do?"</em>), but who could deny being surprised and fairly delighted?</p>
<p>Looking further afield, I wonder (heh) if <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/palworld">Palworld</a>'s success is partly attributable not to its 'Pokémon-with-guns' flavour — as if dropping a cache of firearms into Pokémon was the only way to appeal to adults — but its ambition to take the formula in a different direction. Looking like a proper next-(current-)gen game doesn't hurt, but at least Pocketpair is trying something, risking <em>something</em>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1e2ce8caa2e05"><a title="Palworld" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e2ce8caa2e05/palworld.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Pocketpair</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_beasts">Cassette Beasts</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/temtem">Temtem</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-likes-on-nintendo-switch-games-to-play-after-youve-finished-pokemon">many other excellent monster catchers</a>, indie devs have picked up the <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2023/06/chicory-team-is-making-a-turn-based-rpg-called-beastieball">Beastieball</a></strong> and run with it. I remember thinking that the brilliant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a> was a death knell for traditional Zelda in 2006. I've likened it in the past to outside devs finally mastering the grammar Nintendo established with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina</a>. It took a decade, but Nintendo did finally respond - they <em>did</em> reinvent chocolate with BOTW. (Yes, I know a Toblerone and a video game are very different things; please let me have this laboured metaphor.)</p>
<p>It's worth acknowledging that Game Freak does try new things, too, even if the pace of progress is glacial. As Alana said, ZA's battle mechanics are the best thing about it, and while the many and various Pokémon spin-off games can feel like free-to-play potshots, or half-baked ideas not intriguing enough to sustain a whole game, TPC does experiment with Pokémon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> looks fun! If only the mainline series could inspire such excitement.</p>
<p>What does the future of Pokémon look like, then? Well, the leaks are out there if you're curious. But it feels to me that lapsed Trainers and uberfans alike are starting to align in their 'it is what it is' resignation. 'Phoned-in' isn't fair to the developers who work so hard on these games, but from the outside looking in, they deserve more time and resources.</p>
<p>That the games look like they'd run fine on a PS3 isn't the point; Pokémon conquered the world from a Game Boy in 1996. The real issue is that the series itself feels like a fund-sucking machine fuelled by 'that'll do' energy more than an endeavour to surprise and delight. It could — and really <em>should</em> — be so much more.</p>

<p>The biggest improvement here is in the graphics. A new Visual Fidelity option has been added to the menu to enable the game to run at an even crisper resolution on Switch and Switch 2.

<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is now a new “<strong><em>Visual Fidelity</em></strong>” setting in the Options Menu that improves visual graphics at the cost of performance on the Nintendo Switch. The performance is largely unaffected on stronger devices, and we strongly recommend enabling this setting on <em>Nintendo Switch 2</em>.</li>
<li>This is the best that we can do regarding improving graphic quality without a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix issue where Kaifuku Ball could not be used outside of battle.</li>
<li>Fix a game softlock/freeze when approaching a certain boss battle from a certain position and angle in the final area of Labyrinth 2.</li>
<li>Fix an issue with button input sometimes not working smoothly when selecting party members for a special battle.</li>
<li>Fix an issue with button input in the Tsuri (fishing) minigame occasionally causing the game to stall after a completed reel.</li>
<li>Fix an issue with camera clipping in the Omikuji system.</li>
<li>Fixed a few typos and accidental usage of kanji in certain furigana-only fields.</li>
<li>Fix a rare bug where a character’s Onsen outfit could stay in place even in dialogue taking place outside of the Onsen.</li>
<li>Fix rare case of game freezing (harmless, but for too long) when saving the game.</li>
