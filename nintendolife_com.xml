            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It's no exaggeration to say that we fairly enjoy a bit of the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a> here at Nintendo Life, having dished out very positive reviews to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_advance_collection">Castlevania Advance Collection</a> and, the equally fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> in more recent times.</p>
<p>Of course, grabbing physical editions of these beauties on Nintendo Switch has been a little tricky, especially since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/limited_run_reveals_four_castlevania_anniversary_collection_physical_editions">Limited Run Games' snazzy versions</a> have long since sold out. However, for those amongst us who weren't so quick off the block for LRG's offerings, Play-Asia has some exciting news.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Yes, pre-orders are now live <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/search/castlevania+advance#fc=prc:1.3003249458,o:6?affiliate_id=956097" rel="sponsored noopener">over on Play-Asia</a> for a bunch of Castlevania sets, with Anniversary, Advance and Dominion getting standard and deluxe versions. Fair warning, some of these are <em>very</em> nice. *clutches wallet tightly*</p>
<p>So, what have we actually got here? Well, the Castlevania Anniversary Collection comes in a standard version and a very slick collector's edition. Both of these versions will release on the 26th June, so not long to go!</p>
<p>Oh, and the deluxe version contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Castlevania</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania II Simon's Quest</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania III Dracula's Curse</em></li>
<li><em>Super Castlevania IV</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania The Adventure</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania II Belmont's Revenge</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania Bloodlines</em></li>
<li><em>Kid Dracula (never released in English before)</em></li>
<li><em>History of Castlevania - Book of the Crescent Moon</em></li>
</ul>

<p>With regards to the Advance Collection, these versions will release on 31st July. Here's some PR:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Browse through scans of the original package designs and discover incredible artwork never shown to the public before</em></li>
<li><em>Listen to any of four complete soundtracks any time you want. You can even create your own playlists!</em></li>
<li><em>New 'Quality of Life' Features: Rewind and Quick Save</em></li>
<li><em>ROM Region Selection: You can choose between the Japanese, American, and European versions for each game</em></li>
<li><em>Encyclopedia: Detailed information on enemies, the 'DSS' system, the 'Tactical Soul' system and the 'Spell Fusion' system will help you truly master each game's unique combat system!</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, the Dominus Collection arrives on the 18th of September...so plenty of time to get saving, vampire slayers. Here's some more PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Three incredible action adventure games from the Castlevania series have finally returned, for the first time! In addition to the three action adventure games from the Castlevania series, Haunted Castle Revisited, an redesigned version of the very first Castlevania arcade game, makes its debut! And you can also play it in its original format! Experience the world of Castlevania like never before, with never-before-seen art and handy new features such as rewind, quick saves and much more!</em></p>
</blockquote>


<p>That's a whole lot of Castlevania. Now, we're off to find our credit cards...</p>

<p>AI content doesn't make it to the final game</p>

<figure><a title="level 5 AI" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb882ca401494/level-5-ai.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been seeing the AI-related opinions a video game creator bandied about a bit already over the past few days, with Smash Bros' director Masahiro Sakurai being ever-so-slightly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/smash-bros-director-sakurai-laments-unsustainable-aaa-game-dev-discusses-ai-and-uncertainty">mistranslated in his thoughts</a> over the use of the new tech in artistic endeavours.</p>
<p>Now Level-5's CEO, Akihiro Hino, has been put in a bit of a similar situation, it seems. According to some reports that have popped up online in the past day or two, Hino had said that "Right now, around 80~90% of games are made by AI" when asked about the technology during an interview.</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179xrtvlg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>However, and as explained thoroughly by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lsgcnhens22r">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> in a social media post, Hino's statement was taken right out of context for the sake of drama.</p>

<p>Indeed, reading through Nintendo Patents Watch's translation, it sounds like Hino isn't particularly keen on AI as a creative tool at all, whilst acknowledging its uses. As the translation of Hino's words put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...creativity cannot be completely handed over to AI, it is more of a tool for communication and efficiency improvement. For example, some planners who don't know how to draw can use AI to generate sketches to help express ideas and facilitate communication with artists."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key here is that AI is more of an assistant, something which helps rather than actually <em>does</em>. He backs this further in the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But the very content generated by AI will not be directly used in the game...AI can help us handle certain things more efficiently … but to complete the enormous game volume it requires the creatives to produce and direct the final content output."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hino also addresses fans who complained about game delays, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>, despite the studio reportedly using AI. However, that's "not the case". And given the size of that game, well, it's not surprising it took so long to come out. And it's fantastic.</p>
<p>So, that actually sounds fairly reasonable, or as reasonable as one can be when seeking to hold AI up in a positive light, we guess. Much as was the case with Sakurai, this is just another situation where cherry-picked quotes have been taken out of context.</p>

<p>It's currently limited to three per customer, with standard delivery set at £1.99 / €2.99 (or free if you spend £20 / €24.99 or more).</p>
<p>Nintendo recently hosted a special Direct presentation for Donkey Kong Bananza, during which it introduced a number of new gameplay features, including the ability to transform into new 'Bananza' forms, a special in-game shop to purchase costumes, and the 'DK Artist' mode where you can sculpt and paint objects and characters.</p>
<p>It's looking pretty sweet, and we seriously can't wait to get our hands on the final game next month.</p>
