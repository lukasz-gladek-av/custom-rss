            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Today we got an in-depth look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive which launches on 5th March 2026.</p>
<p>And the Extended Trailer didn't skimp on details; in Pokopia, you'll be teaming up with Professor Tangrowth to help restore an island that was once populated by people and Pokémon. That involves rebuilding structures, watering the grass, setting up fishing rods, laying rocks, grass, and flowers, and tons more.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play with the Pokémon you bring to your island, but you'll also need to help some 'mons adjust to life or get out of sticky situations. You'll need to fulfill requests for them, which in turn will help develop the island.</p>

<p>Your Ditto will also be able to transform into other Pokémon, and in this trailer, we saw the little blob (well, blob disguised as a human) become a Lapras and a Dragonite.</p>
<p>Lapras allows Ditto to travel to other islands via the ocean, while Dragonite lets Ditto travel even further, flying to the furthest corners of the world.</p>

<p>Your Ditto avatar also doesn't need to stay pink, either; you'll be able to customise your character as you see fit, with different outfits, hairstyles, and hair colours.</p>
<p>And multiplayer sounds fantastic, too — four friends can play together to help build structures or just show off their islands. And Pokémon Pokopia is GameShare ready, meaning you can play with a friend who has a Switch 1 <em>or</em> 2 and who doesn't own the game.</p>

<p>But the biggest reveal came at the end of the trailer — three brand new Pokémon forms for a few beloved 'mons. If you don't count Professor Tangrowth, that is.</p>
<p>Pikachu, Snorlax, and Smeargle are each getting a unique form in Pokopia names Peakychu, Mosslax, and Smearguru. What role they'll play in the game remains to be seen, but let us say that, right now, Mosslax is a <em>mood</em>.</p>

<p>Today's trailer was teased by The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-gets-march-2026-release-date-brand-new-trailer-coming-this-week">back on Tuesday</a>, when it also revealed the 5th March 2026 release date. We also know this will be the first game published by Nintendo in the West to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-is-nintendos-first-game-key-card-release">a Game-Key Card release</a>.</p>

<p>Release date confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Valve has been making headlines this week with its latest lineup of hardware, and rumours suggest that the company isn't done with the announcements just yet...</p>
<p>Assuming for a moment that we're probably not going to get <strong>Half-Life 3</strong> or <strong>Portal 3</strong> anytime soon, however, we're quite happy with the news that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chromagun-2-dye-hard">Chromagun 2: Dye Hard</a> will be making its way to the Switch 2 on <strong>12th February, 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>If you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chromagun">the first entry</a>, then you'll probably know the gist already. Chromagun 2 is a homage of sorts to Valve's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal 2</a>, but instead of portals, you'll be messing around with colours. Essentially, by matching coloured items found within the levels, they'll attract via magnetism and allow to you solve intricate puzzles.</p>
<p>The first game was pretty neat and we awarded it a solid score of 8/10. So we're expecting some good things with the upcoming sequel! Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A one-of-a-kind tool - The ChromaGun: Wield the titular "ChromaGun," a versatile paint-gun used to shoot primary colors onto surfaces and objects, mixing them to manipulate the environment</p>
<p>- Magnetoid Chromatism: Master the key mechanic of "Magnetoid Chromatism" - a proprietary concept where Droids and other objects are magnetically attracted to walls of the same color.</p>
<p>- Multiverse Puzzles: Travel through time and space across different dimensions and parallel universes, each introducing new physics and increasingly complex mechanics.</p>
<p>- State of the art accessibility: Pixel Maniacs developed a unique accessibility game mode overlaying symbols on colored objects to help color blind players to enjoy the game too! With this well thought feature, ChromaGun 2 Dye Hard won the Horizon Award for Technical Innovation at GG Bavaria 2025!</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160504/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Developed by Pine Creek Games and published by Noodlecake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/winter_burrow">Winter Burrow</a> is a cosy woodland survival game where you play as a mouse who braves frigid weather, collects food and resources, and rebuilds their childhood home.</p>
<p>It begins with the death of our young mouse protagonist's parents, prompting a return to the long-abandoned family burrow. It's an opening that echoes the call for a simpler, more self-actualised life that is seen at the beginning of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> and many early <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> titles, yet Winter Burrow's beginning is tinged with a sadness that threads itself through the remaining plot in a way that feels appropriate for a cast of wildlife creatures trying to survive a brutal winter.</p>
<p>Given the suitably melancholy start of the game, I was hopeful that Winter Burrow would weave together the cosy and the cruel in a survival landscape equal parts challenging and charming. For a survival game, however, Winter Burrow is lacking in that oh-so-important tension between risk and reward. The resulting experience is surprisingly linear and short-lived despite its artful aesthetic presentation. While you can technically spend as long as you want building furniture and decorating the burrow, gaining access to all the tools and areas through the main plot takes under 10 hours; there’s not much to entertain afterwards.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160498/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The art style has often been compared to that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/donrt_starve_nintendo_switch_edition">Don't Starve</a>, but the two games have distinct approaches to the mechanics of survival. When you die in Don't Starve, you lose all of your progress and must begin again from the start of an entirely different world map.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to deplete your health in Winter Burrow — taking damage from the varying forms of bugs that wander the wilderness, staying out in the cold for too long, or simply starving — but death isn't actually a possibility for our little mouse. They simply pass out, dropping all of their items in an animation also reminiscent of Klei Entertainment's game, and find themself back at home none the worse.</p>
<p>Passing out would be more of a deterrent if resources were more precious, but it’s easy to replenish everything, from building materials like wood and rocks to ingredients such as nuts and berries. The joy of tracking down and even stockpiling difficult-to-come-by ingredients is half the fun of crafting in survival games. Crafting in Winter Burrow feels like it requires a grocery list more than a treasure hunt. Making new, updated clothing is worthwhile since it generally offers better cold resistance, but the majority of furniture is just for looks.</p>

<p>Winter Burrow is meant to be more forgiving than your everyday survival game, and it certainly accomplishes that. There just isn’t a whole lot gameplay-wise to fill the holes in a survival game that isn’t very challenging. Although the woodland neighbours are interesting and distinctive, their interactions are limited, and once you’re done with the main story, there’s not much reason to stick around.</p>
<p>The Danish developers describe Winter Burrow as a game where “it is you who tells the story.” These kinds of buzz phrases seem to pop up more and more often as the years go on, but it feels like a particularly inaccurate description in this case. The player does not make choices that impact the plot in Winter Burrow. Certain sections of the map are inaccessible without specific tools, which can’t be constructed without completing NPC requests. It’s a plot on a train track - not at all what I would call telling my own story, and a bit out of place with survival game norms.</p>
<figure><a title="Winter Burrow Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160502/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What Winter Burrow gets right, though, it gets very right indeed. The art that renders the intrepid winter wonderland is beautiful. The music and sound design lend themselves well to each scene and scenario. A little mouse knitting in a big armchair next to a crackling fire is as cosy as it gets, and don’t even get me started on getting to dress a mouse up in different tiny hats and sweaters.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the game held up well in both handheld and docked mode, although the images are crisper and the UI is easier to make out while playing docked on a larger screen. It was sometimes difficult to tell what menu option was currently selected while crafting and looking at the required materials in handheld mode, but this is a pretty minor complaint.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ultimately, Winter Burrow is a fun, cute game that could make for a cosy weekend, but its lack of mechanical depth precludes it from lasting significance.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: a nice, linear plot and the ability to make cute furnishings for a hollowed-out tree of a home can be a lovely gaming experience. If only because the scaffolding itself is so wonderfully crafted, I wanted more from Winter Burrow than it was able to give.</p></section>
