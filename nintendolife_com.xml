<p>Yes, despite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> smashing the competition last week, this time, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has drifted back into first place, with an additional ~50,000 units to its name. Air Riders follows in second with a little over 46,000 weekly units, but damn, there really is no stopping Mario, huh?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Konami's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/momotaro_dentetsu_2_anata_no_machi_mo_kitto_aru_-_higashi_nihon_hen_plus_nishi_nihon_hen">Momotaro Dentetsu</a> board game sequel continues to sell well on both Switch 1 and 2, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is still hanging firm at seventh — which is more than can be said for its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/uk-charts-kirby-is-nowhere-to-be-seen-in-a-quiet-week">UK standings</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adojpxuz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>In the hardware charts, the Switch 2 stays firmly on top with an additional 97,677 units to its name, followed by the PS5 Digital Edition and the Switch OLED.</p>
<p>Things are so close between the PS5 and Switch 1 this week, that combining the SKU's for the two consoles only narrowly tips things in Sony's favour. The standard Switch, OLED and Lite come together for 35,327, while the three PS5 models sneak in with 35,786.</p>

<p>"An impossible port that impresses"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>December has gotten off to quite the start, hasn't it? With so many new games launching on Switch 2, we're sure that you're keen to find out how each and every one of them runs on the fresh hardware and, as ever, the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U5h4_MqXaU">Digital Foundry</a> are here to do just that.</p>
<p>This time, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' Switch 2 port that's being put under the microscope. The above video sets a baseline of the Xbox Series S version and compares the technical flair of the new Nintendo hybrid from there. So, what does DF make of it?</p>
<p>Visually, the Switch 2 has some obvious cutbacks from the Series S edition. Without SSR, the handheld version is lacking most water reflection and movement, and you'll notice some decrease in foliage at a middle distance. Textures also come in at a decreased resolution, and, ironically, the titular shadows don't hold up as well as they do elsewhere — though, at half the storage size of the Series S release, this is hardly surprising.</p>
<p>All that said, DF describes the Switch 2 edition as "a pretty handsome rendition of the game", one that comes in very close to the Series S.</p>
<p>In terms of image quality, the game utilises DLSS technology to help along the docked mode's typical 648p resolution, and produces a much better image than that number would suggest in the process. This is, of course, reduced in handheld play, where DF counted resolutions as low as 400p, but it all remains "pretty respectable" in action and is even considered "more reliable in portable play than when docked".</p>
<p>The game mostly sticks to its 30fps target in typical play, though its frame pacing is rather poor, and there are occasional dips in particularly taxing locations or cutscenes.</p>
<p>All in all, DF considers Shadows on Switch 2 as "an impossible port that impresses", something we firmly agreed with in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[IO Interactive Shares Lots Of Gameplay Details In '007: First' Light Dev Diary]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/io-interactive-shares-lots-of-gameplay-details-in-007-first-light-dev-diary</link>
            <guid>1372789</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>IO Interactive is in our good books big time off the back of all the premium-grade assassinating they've let us do across the globe as Agent 47. Now the team has taken up the mantle (the obvious next step for those paying attention) of James Bond himself, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>.</p>
<p>And ahead of the game's <strong>27th March 2026</strong> release date, IO has dropped the very first in a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL2hzHtdW38">dev diary deep dives</a> aimed at exploring this latest Bond adventure alongside interested players. What an absolute high this dev team has been on with the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and it looks like it'll continue here.</p>
<p>We've already seen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-than-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">bits and pieces of the game</a>, and we know it's a reimagining of the Bond origin story, featuring a young 007. But this first episode, which you can watch in full above, concentrates on gameplay, as the series as a whole looks to cover the design philosophy and creative processes.</p>

<p>It's interesting stuff, so make sure to check it out for all the new gameplay footage, and discussions about the game's blend of mechanics, which it seems will - in part at least - run with some <strong>Hitman</strong> aspects, developing on stuff such as questioning and observing, and blending into your surroundings. Oh boy, we can't wait.</p>
<p>One example mentioned in the video is "enforcers", meaning NPCs who see through you because they "know" everyone who works in a particular building or area. So this then introduces a new puzzle style to work with.</p>
<p>We also get some tantalising chat about how the devs want to balance thing to give players freedom to approach any situation the way they want as Bond, whilst also making it so the execution of any given plan you hatch can go wildly wrong and need re-tuning on the fly. All the good stuff we hoped we'd hear them speak about when approaching James Bond in their signature style, basically.</p>
<p>Andreas Krogh, the gameplay director on 007: First Light also mentions new techniques they've come up with by "marrying" Bond's style with their take on stealth. So you have some new deescalation options, such as bluffing. Here we see that Bond can smooth talk his way out of a scenario where the only option for 47 would be to pan somebody in the head or run away.</p>

<p>Thomas Pulluelo, the game's level designer, also pops up to show how the rather nice looking environs on display are designed so that players can see opportunities more easily and naturally. So hopefully fewer shiny pipes and yellow footholds, and more feeling like you did it all yourself. Nice.</p>
<p>There's are some fantastic sequences (so do make sure to check out the full vid) that show off the amazingly brutal action and combat we can expect in March of next year. This young Bond does some vicious CQC, he charges down foes and gets stuck in like a proper trained killer. Expect plenty of quick switching between fist fights, shooting with fancy guns, stealth action and lots of crashing of expensive cars and then reloading the game.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of cars, where did we put the keys to our motor? It's been leaking oil slicks and randomly firing machine gun bullets out of its hood again. Honestly, Q's been right off their game recently.</p>
<p>If you're looking forward to 007: First Light, make sure you check out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/why-007-first-light-is-the-most-exciting-game-of-2026">Push Square's preview</a> from back in September; they might be more excited than us!</p>
