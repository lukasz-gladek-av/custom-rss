<p>An Intelligent Systems top-down adventure also on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We now know the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">launch line-up</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics</a> service, coming to Nintendo Switch Online on <strong>17th February 2026</strong>. And while it's all worth getting excited over, there are two never-before-released games coming out later in the year that Nintendo enthusiasts should be particularly excited about.</p>
<p>Right at the end of the brand new overview trailer (at around <a href="https://youtu.be/nVvaCe4esCQ?si=QQAHZqkIL2PYIKMw&amp;t=187" data-yt-videoid="nVvaCe4esCQ" data-yt-start="187">3:07</a>), Nintendo showed off footage from two cancelled Virtual Boy games that will be playable for the first time ever via Nintendo Switch Online — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a> (also known as Dragon Hopper). Both of these will be coming to the service sometime in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Zero Racers a pretty big deal for long-time Nintendo fans — this is a cancelled <strong>F-Zero</strong> spin-off that was apparently shown off at E3 1996, but was cancelled due to the failure of the Virtual Boy. A few years ago, a former Nintendo of America localiser said that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/mythical-virtual-boy-f-zero-spin-off-was-100percent-complete-according-to-former-noa-staffer">the game "was done"</a> (as in complete), and this release seems to confirm that.</p>

<p>The latter game, D-Hopper, is from Intelligent Systems, who we know best for developing the <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> games. D-Hopper is very much its own thing, and was also playable at E3 1996 — it's a top-down adventure game where you have to adventure through maze-like maps and fight enemies in order to rescue your girlfriend. A little Zelda-esque, perhaps?</p>
<p>Both of these games are fantastic additions to the service, and we're excited to check them out for the first time ever later in the year. The Virtual Boy might not be well-loved, but it's got an eclectic library of games and spin-offs.</p>
<p>The launch line-up is pretty solid too, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Wario Land</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3D Tetris</a> all part of the package day-one.</p>

<p>Two previously unreleased games are also coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Those of you excited to relive the glory days of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> only have a few more weeks to wait until you can play them on Nintendo Switch Online on Switch 1 and Switch 2. <strong>17th February</strong> is approaching fast!</p>
<p>Today, Nintendo has dropped a brand new trailer confirming the launch line-up for the new service along with a handful of features and surprises.</p>
<p>Seven games will be available from the jump, with more to be added "in the future". As per usual, then. Here's all the games you'll be able to play from 17th February:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/galactic_pinball">Galactic Pinball</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3-D TETRIS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/innsmouth_no_yakata">The Mansion of Innsmouth</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>A pretty healthy starting line-up, if we do say so ourselves. Wario Land felt like a day-one given, as did 3-D Tetris. Of course, more are coming in the future, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/marios_tennis">Mario's Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/jack_bros">Jack Bros.</a>, and two never-before-released games in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D(ragon)-Hopper</a>.</p>
<p>To play Virtual Boy games, you'll need to grab the Virtual Boy accessory for your console; either the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">standard one</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">cardboard version</a> will do.</p>
<p>Other features available on the service include the ability to Rewind gameplay, make save states, check and remap controls, and — later in the year — change the colour of the screen.</p>
