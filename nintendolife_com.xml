<p>YouTuber Nate the Hate has claimed that a Nintendo Direct is due to take place later this month.</p>
<p>Speaking on his latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y">podcast episode</a>, Nate states that a Direct will take place after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. He goes on to stress that he does not know any further details, including specific dates, timings, and potential content.</p>
<p>He does, however, speculate that a Direct could happen in the last week of July, theorising that Nintendo will want to put a new showcase out before its three-month earnings release on <strong>Friday, 1st August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I have been told... There is a Direct this month, so the month of July. But, that Direct will not take place until after Donkey Kong Bananza releases. Beyond that, I have no additional information, I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point.</p>
<p>"If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st, right, which is Nintendo's earning report day. So I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investor's report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nate has proven to be reliable in the past, having successfully predicted the exact date on which the Switch 2 announcement trailer would drop. Still, it's worth taking this with a grain of salt regardless. It's a fairly safe estimate, all told, given that Nintendo has often dropped announcements and Directs around the time of its earnings reports.</p>
<p>We also have to keep in mind that we're getting a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-next-pokemon-presents-is-coming-in-july">Pokémon Presents showcase on 22nd July</a>. It wouldn't be completely out of the question for Nintendo to follow up with a proper Direct so soon after, but it's definitely another wrinkle to consider.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question mark lingering over our heads at the moment is when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is due to release. The game is scheduled to launch this year, but no specifics have been shared at the time of writing. We're also very keen to learn when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is due to launch, too.</p>
