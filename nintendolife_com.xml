<p>Get ready for a 2026 release</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last September, Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a> would be arriving in Spring 2026.</p>
<p>We haven't really heard anything about it since then, and now in a slight development, a rating has been spotted on the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Here it is:</p>
<figure data-uuid="4bc525af7d446"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bc525af7d446/super-mario-bros-wonder.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ESRB</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This hopefully means an update about this title is nearby, and perhaps Nintendo will lock in a release date.</p>
<p>When Bellabel Park opens its doors, according to Nintendo, you'll be able to experience a variety of attractions where you team up (or work against) friends and family to collect the most coins, run and hide in "Phanto tag", and much more.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2 Edition, this version of the game will "other content and enhancements", with more details to be revealed in the future. You can find out a little more about what to expect in our previous story.</p>

<p>The game’s focus on NPCs and a literal desert of an open world did not resonate with gamers as well as Retro Studios had hoped.

None of the people complaining about the dialogue better be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">Xenoblade</a> fans, though.

<p>That’s not what I’m writing about today, however. I’m going to explain what Prime 4 does better than any other Nintendo-developed game. This isn’t about the game’s gorgeous visuals or silky smooth frame rate; it’s about its accessibility features.</p>
<p>If any of you can remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-straight-up-fails-in-just-one-respect-accessibility">my piece about</a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-straight-up-fails-in-just-one-respect-accessibility">Tears of the Kingdom</a></strong>, I’m paralysed from about the chest down with no finger movement. It’s obviously not ideal for gaming, but I’ve played thousands and thousands of hours worth of games across multiple genres without any adaptive equipment. Except for one genre, first-person shooters.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/metroid/related-articles:149509 @ 1768175876 -->
<p>The Prime games are different than standard action-focused FPSs and instead focus on exploring. They also feature a lock-on similar to the Zelda series. I would have never even attempted playing Prime 4 if not for that. The controls would still need to be remapped in my Switch 2’s system settings so I could tap the shooting and jump buttons while still holding the lock-on, though.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6be3a2a9f0a22"><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6be3a2a9f0a22/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I began hatching my plan of attack while downloading my brother’s digital game card onto my system. What I came up with was moving the lock-on to 'A' so I could jump with 'B' and shoot the power beam and missiles with 'X' and 'Y', respectively.</p>
<p>I didn’t have to do that, though. Did I magically regain movement I have been without for over 15 years? No, something even more unlikely happened: a Nintendo-developed game had in-game remapping.</p>
<p>It might not sound like much, but the difference between changing remaps at the system level and doing it in-game is huge. This meant I didn’t have to delete one of my saved layouts (you only get five per controller) or deal with button prompts that contradicted my remaps. I can’t tell you how many times I failed taming horses in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> and TOTK because of the button prompt tricking me into pressing 'L' when I remapped that input to 'ZL'.</p>
<p>Prime 4 also separates control schemes for the morph ball and Vi-O-La, so they could be remapped independently. That’s another thing that doesn’t sound like a big deal but actually is. Imagine how annoying it would be having to change the controls every time Samus morph-balled or jumped on her motorcycle. Even thinking about that is giving me a migraine.</p>

<p>So after remapping everything to my liking and some trial and error with the camera and reticle controls (I settled on dual stick plus gyro), I set off for adventure. I swallowed my pride and played on casual mode which did some heavy lifting while I built up my energy tank collection. My progress took off after the initial struggles and I cleared the game right under 16 hours. I probably would have beaten it an hour quicker if Myles had just told me where Tokabi was in the desert. The one time I wanted some direction on where to go and I got nothing. What a dork.</p>
<p>A thought occurred to me while watching the credits: Do I think Prime 4’s inclusion of in-game remapping will lead to it being in other Nintendo-developed games? It wasn’t in Prime Remastered, so they must be rethinking the matter. Right?</p>
<p>The answer is obviously no. This was just Retro Studios acting on its own. No other game developed by any other Nintendo-owned studio will have it during the Switch 2’s lifetime. You might think that’s a pretty bold statement but high-ranking Nintendo officials have made it clear they aren’t going to do it. Read this back and forth from <a href="https://kotaku.com/breath-of-the-wild-is-getting-a-sequel-because-the-team-1835624233">Jason Schreier’s interview</a> with the master of the Zelda franchise, Eiji Aonuma, from 2019:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> When we have a button arrangement, we very much put thought into how we do it, because there’s a specific way we want players to feel. In some ways, if we freely let players do customizations on key assignments and such, I feel like we’re letting go of our responsibility as a developer by just kind of handing everything over to the users. We have something in mind for everybody when we play the game, so that’s what we hope players experience and enjoy as well. But we understand also that players have a desire for free customization.</p>
<p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Also, physically disabled players might not be able to play the way developers intended.</p>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> Definitely, that’s a very good point, and that’s something we’ll keep in mind going forward, thinking about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Aonuma-san thought about it and then decided to not include a remapping option in the two Zeldas released after this interview, Tears of the Kingdom and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>. He didn’t even allow it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a>! The lack of it in Age of Imprisonment is incredibly damning, as you can remap the controls in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a>, which was built in the exact same engine (Koei Tecmo’s Katana Engine) three years prior.</p>

<p>Aonuma-san has since been promoted from Deputy Manager to Senior Officer at Nintendo EPD (home of Nintendo’s software development groups), which means his belief that developers shouldn’t allow players to remap their controls in-game is likely echoed throughout every team there. Metroid Prime 4’s development was only “overseen” by Production Group 6, which perhaps explains why Retro was able to get away with it.</p>
<p>Why Nintendo’s leadership is so weird about accessibility features when their peers do include them is beyond me. Sony and Microsoft wouldn’t make games more accessible unless the effort to do so was profitable. You’d think the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/dont-let-nintendo-ruin-the-entire-industry-is-usd80-for-mario-kart-world-a-bridge-too-far">leading the charge</a> on higher game prices would know that.</p>
<p>This isn’t about money for Nintendo, though; it apparently is one of its core design philosophies. Retro Studios’ efforts in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond prove it’s a dumb ideal. The team's inclusion of incredibly basic accessibility features in Prime 4 did not negatively affect the gameplay at all. It was no different than any other Prime game in that regard. The actual mistakes Retro made were the momentum-killing open world, straight-as-an-arrow level design, and bad writing. None of those were related to making the game more accessible, plus, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-suggests-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-meant-it-was-divorced-from-the-changing-of-times">according to a recent Famitsu interview</a>, the open-world idea might have been forced on Retro.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8b46fe00d63c3"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Accessibility" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b46fe00d63c3/metroid-prime-4-beyond-accessibility.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Hilliard Hendrix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It makes me almost sad that the most accessible Nintendo game I’ve played ended up being disappointing. A real monkeypaw situation for your boy. On top of that, Retro’s next original game may not release this decade based on how long it took to ship Prime 4. We aren’t going to see another Nintendo game with worthwhile accessibility features until then.</p>
<p>That’s not going to keep me from buying nearly everything Nintendo puts out, because it’s had its hooks in me since I was a little kid, but its choice to be this way gets more frustrating by the day.</p>

<p>The 2016 action role-playing title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria</a> is getting a remastered released on the Switch next month, and we've got some additional details to share about this version's performance and resolution.</p>
<p>As we highlighted in the original announcement last November, the game will target <strong>30fps</strong>. Some extra information from Bandai Namco further notes how the frame rate may change during certain moments of the game:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In comparison, the other versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a> on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will be running at 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the remaster's resolution on Switch, TV mode will run at <strong>1920 x 1080</strong>, and in handheld fans can expect <strong>1280 x 720</strong>. Other versions of the game will support up to 4K.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also notes how it's been testing the compatibility of the game with the Switch Lite and Switch 2, so if there are any significant developments regarding the game on Switch 2, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This follows the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a> on the Switch in October last year, which also ran at 30fps and was 1080p docked, and 720p in handheld mode.</p>
