And a recent datamine of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> has brought all of those hopes and dreams to the surface (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-set-to-finally-acknowledge-donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-character-and-fans-are-now-convinced-the-timing-points-to-mario-kart-world-dlc">IGN</a>!).</p>
<p>So, some context: earlier this week, Nintendo updated its news app with a suite of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-today-mobile-app-update-adds-a-new-donkey-kong-theme">Donkey Kong themes</a>, with many of them seemingly inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Fans decided to datamine the themes and see which Kong characters would be appearing in the future and over on Famiboards, user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/donkey-kong-community-st2-ohhh-bananza.14427/page-64#post-2086247">MondoMega shared the results</a>, and there were a few surprises.</p>
<p>Now, beyond this point, we'll be going into <strong>big Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> <strong>spoilers</strong>, so if you haven't beaten the game yet and want to be surprised, then stop reading right now; the spoilers will be after the image.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c3b2a8231e02"><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c3b2a8231e02/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Watch out, spoilers below! — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It turns out, none other than King K. Rool will be featuring on the app on 15th December. Nintendo has rarely acknowledged the villainous croc in recent years, besides his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, and Donkey Kong Bananza's endgame — and his role as the final boss — was a huge surprise to many. Kritters will also be appearing a few days prior, on 9th.</p>
<p>Now, why would Nintendo have K. Rool pop up on the calendar on 15th December? Honestly, it may well be a harmless bit of promotion. Nintendo features multiple characters unrelated to game releases on the app.</p>
<p>But the timing of this update, and all of the assets coming from Bananza (you can see all of the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong">datamined animations on Mario Wiki</a> - beware of spoilers, obviously) has people fervently speculating; will King K. Rool be added to Mario Kart World?</p>
<p>It's not just baseless speculation, either; shortly after Bananza launched, eagle-eyed players noticed that both King K. Rool <em>and</em> Void Kong's voices <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/">were listed in Mario Kart World's credits</a>, but neither character was in the game.</p>
<p>So will we be getting some DLC news soon? The Game Awards are next week, but Nintendo rarely makes an appearance at the ceremony, with its biggest announcements there being Bayonetta Origins and a variety of Smash Bros. DLC. Could the Big N buck the trend in 2025? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>For now, take this with a pinch of salt. We'd <em>love</em> to see K. Rool in a kart, but we won't get our hopes up just yet.</p>

<p>Vroom for four, and 120fps mode to boot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>3Goo, which has previously published the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gear_club_unlimited_2_-_definitive_edition">Gear.Club</a> series and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wrc_generations">WRC Generations</a> on Nintendo consoles, has announced a brand new multiplayer grand-prix racer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/4pgp-four-player-grand-prix">4PGP: Four-Player Grand Prix</a>, which releases on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, has a phenomenally straight-forward moniker, and we reckon that suits its aims as a no-nonsense 90s-style racer just fine, as the keyword here is "simplicity" in being able to pick up and play, with easy to grasp controls.</p>
<p>That extends to the visuals too, in the clean and simplistic graphical style adopted to bring this arcade speeding to life with 4K and 120fps on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The game also features track "design contributions" from Kenji Sasaki, who of course designed the tracks for little known racers such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> and <strong>Sega Rally</strong>. Hold on, what? Excuse us? Oh, and you've also got a soundtrack by Tomoyuki Kawamura, who did the music for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/sega_rally_championship">Sega Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/virtua_racing">Virtua Racing</a>. Wow.</p>
<p>Here's some more deets from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arcade Racing for Every Skill Level:</strong></p>
<p>Four difficulty settings, Rookie, Novice, Veteran, and Expert, as well as an Assist Mode for younger racers, making it easy for newcomers to jump in while giving experienced racers a real challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem with Game Share:</strong></p>
<p>Race solo or with up to four players in split-screen, and join friends with GameShare locally on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, or play online with others on Nintendo Switch 2 via GameChat.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Game Modes:</strong></p>
<p>Hop into Quick Races for instant fun, tackle a full set of courses in Championship Mode, or chase perfect laps in Time Attack Mode.</p>
<p><strong>Unlockable Tracks and Vehicles:</strong></p>
<p>Race and unlock an expanding lineup of 14 circuits and build out your collection of 19 cars.</p>
<p><strong>90s Vibe, Modern Tech:</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy a 90s-inspired arcade racing feel paired with modern visuals and performance, powered by a custom engine. For Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, the game supports 4K resolution and 120fps.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We like the look of this one, and if 3goo can nail the driving, get the arcade feel just right and give online that works well, this one could fill a proper hole in our Switch libraries when it comes to F1-style racing with pals. We're also totally down for that price point of <strong>$24.99</strong> on Switch 2 and <strong>$19.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>

Discovery to acquire Warner Bros. in a deal that's valued at roughly <strong>$82.7 billion</strong> — an equity value of $72 billion.</p>
<p>Netflix is specifically acquiring Warner Bros.' Streaming &amp; Studios company, which <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_presentations/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Investor-Presentation-06-09-25.pdf">it created in June 2025</a> and includes including <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, the DC Universe, <strong>Harry Potter</strong>, <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong>, and platforms such as HBO and HBO Max and Warner Bros.

<p>The media company doesn't mention WB's gaming division at all in its press release. However, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">Game Developer</a> has confirmed with a WB spokesperson that "the recently-restructured video game division... will be joining Netflix."</p>
<p>Currently, Warner Bros. Games includes a number of studios such as Rocksteady (<strong>Batman: Arkham</strong> series), NetherRealm Studios (<strong>Mortal Kombat</strong>), TT Games (<strong>LEGO</strong>), Portkey Games, and Avalanche Studios (Harry Potter), along with WB's studios in Boston, Montréal, New York, and San Francisco.</p>
<p>It's a huge deal that Netflix expect to take around 12-18 months, but that's if it goes through. We know how long <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/its-over-microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard">other huge acquisitions have taken</a>. Plus regulators are more than likely to get involved. Paramount had previously attempted to purchase the studio in October, which was rejected.</p>

<p>If successful, Warner Bros. shareholders will receive $27.75 a share along with stock in Netflix and the company expects to make savings of around $2-$3 billion by the third year.</p>
<p>The deal could have a huge impact on these studios, and is yet another example of consolidation in the video game industry at a time when layoffs, game studio sales, and closures are rampant.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">reports emerged</a> that Netflix was selling Spry Fox, developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cozy_grove">Cozy Grove</a>, back to the owners.</p>
