<figure data-uuid="0bb4ac7f3e954"><a title="Nintendo Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bb4ac7f3e954/nintendo-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will acquire a majority stake in Bandai Namco Studios Singapore after reaching an agreement with Bandai Namco for the transfer of shares next year.</p>
<p>Described in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html">the press release</a> as being "for the purpose of strengthening its development structure," BNSS will become a Nintendo subsidiary and go by the new name of Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>
<p>The deal is planned to go through on 1st April 2026, with Nintendo acquiring 80% of shares, with the rest to follow some time after "once the subsidiary’s operations have stabilized."</p>
<p>Nintendo has partnered with Bandai Namco on several first-party projects, with this studio having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> (contributing concept art, character modelling, environment modelling, and animation, according to <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/news/games/splatoon-3/">the studio's website</a>) as well as various high-profile Bandai Namco games. Here's a description of the studio from <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/">Bandai Namco's site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years, our studio in Singapore has worked on a variety of iconic game titles such as TEKKEN, ACE COMBAT, SOUL CALIBUR and Taiko no Tatsujin. From concept to art, and all the way to development, we cover it all. Explore our portfolio of game and demo titles by selecting any of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo anticipates that the acquisition "will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year."</p>
<p>This latest acquisition follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-states-its-intention-to-acquire-more-development-teams">acknowledgement earlier in November</a> that the company intended to expand its internal development teams. Nintendo Pictures was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/nintendo-publishes-job-listings-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">another addition in 2022</a>, followed by Shiver Entertainment's integration <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/shiver-entertainment-has-updated-its-website-after-being-acquired-by-nintendo">in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>For reference, here's the full text from the investor announcement:</p>

<p>Back in 2011, the DS was gifted one of the all-time great <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alien_isolation">Alien</a> franchise games in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/aliens_infestation">Aliens: Infestation</a>, a slick and polished Metroidvania that nails its mix of puzzling, platforming, signature series tension, and great big scary extraterrestrials (alongside their face-hugging pals). Hey, we even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2011/10/aliens_infestation_ds">gave it an 8/10 back at release</a>, so you just know it's verified fresh, or whatever they're saying these days.</p>
<p>It's a very good game that you should definitely play, in short. Even if you don't like Metroidvanias or aliens. Because of one song.</p>
<p>As we were happily reminded this very morning, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social/post/3m6lqhazfs22a">via a much-appreciated social media post,</a> of the ending credits song for Aliens: Infestation (below), written by the very same band (Guyz Nite) who penned the also wonderful <a href="https://youtu.be/dH34jMqHBmw?si=9ZQDc0uf6d8PkmUg">Die Hard song</a> (warning for NSFW swearing, but otherwise a treat and a wonderful Xmas song to boot).</p>

<p>If you can listen to this and somehow resist immediately diving back in to replay the whole flipping game all over again, you've got more willpower than this writer. And shoutout to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social">@MrHallenback</a> for the Thursday morning levity!</p>

<p>More Mega Man action in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a> in September, mentioning at the time how this new retro package would be arriving on the Switch at some point in 2026.</p>
<p>In an update, this new collection featuring multiple titles from the DS generation has now been rated E10+ by the ESRB – with the rating listing "Fantasy Violence" and "Users Interact". Here's the official ESRB summary in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection</em> is rated E10+ for Everyone 10+ by the ESRB with Fantasy Violence. Also includes Users Interact. This is a collection of action role-playing games in which players help characters battle viruses in a futuristic world. Players interact with characters, explore fantasy environments, and use battle cards to perform attacks on enemies in an arena. Battle-card attacks include use of energy blasts, punches, kicks, bombs, ice blasts, and swords. A higher-resolution art gallery depicts other violent acts: robots cut in half or impaled by swords; a character with arrows sticking out of his back."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Protodude, the owner of Mega Man fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/">Rockman Corner</a>, also notes how the "three original releases", which started out as a series in 2006/07, all carried 'E' ratings back in the day in this same location. With any luck, fans won't have to wait much longer for these games to return.</p>

<p>Once again, here are the titles and additional versions from this series included in this collection. You can find out more about what to expect from this new collection in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Leo</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxNinja</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxSamurai</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One other Switch game that's recently surfaced on the ESRB is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which is due out on the Switch and Switch 2 next month.</p>

<p>This patch follows a launch update for the title on <strong>5th November 2025</strong>. You can find out more about today's update in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-adds-new-weapons-and-challenges-in-free-update-this-week">our previous story</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't already joined the fight in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, here's a sample of what we had to say about it in our review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</p>

<p>Support for "GameCube adapters in Wii U mode" also added</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d47e43c4fbfc2"><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d47e43c4fbfc2/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>During the original Switch generation, PC gaming giant Valve added Nintendo controller support to its Steam client.</p>
<p>Now that the Switch 2 has arrived on the scene, Valve has issued a Steam Client Beta update for November 2025 that adds support for the new hybrid system's Pro Controller.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Added support for Nintendo Switch 2 controllers connected over USB on Windows"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some more surprising news, Valve has also "added support for GameCube adapters in Wii U mode with rumble on Windows". So, you can now use wired GameCube controllers with this accessory. You can see the official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/599669707226744434">patch notes on the Steam community page</a>.</p>
<p>Steam has previously added support for Nintendo's original Switch Pro Controller. Other Nintendo controllers are also supported on Steam such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/08/valves-steam-client-beta-adds-support-for-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers">Joy-Con</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3361392458123611354">Switch Online classic controllers</a>.</p>
<p>In some <em>other</em> controller news, Nintendo recently rolled out updates for its controllers on the Switch 2 following a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/psa-dont-forget-to-update-your-switch-2-pro-controller">major firmware update</a>.</p>
