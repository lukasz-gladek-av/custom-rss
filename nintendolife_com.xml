Hello there, folks! Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>That little Hylian slip-up might be a hint of things to come, but first, let's take a look at what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-rayman-gbc">last time</a>, when a trio of covers for the Game Boy Color's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> went head-to-head (to-head). The votes were pretty evenly split, but it was the red European cover that walked away with 49% and the win. The green North American variant followed behind with 31%, while Japan brought up the rear with 21%.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>With The Legend of Zelda series celebrating its 40th anniversary this weekend, we're taking a look at the only BAB contender we <em>haven't</em> touched on before: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>. Now yes, BAB fans, we did look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/poll_box_art_brawl_9_-_the_legend_of_zelda_links_awakening_dx">GBC's DX version</a> back in 2019, but the OG release came with regional covers of its own, don't you know.</p>
<p>Europe and North America went down the same route this time, so we've got a duel between East and West. Let's crack this egg open!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/zelda/related-articles:5571,150579 @ 1771761625 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="8d3d0b10b62c3"><a title="Zelda: Link's Awakening - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d3d0b10b62c3/zelda-links-awakening-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3033-the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'll admit, this design is very similar to what you'll find for the GBC version in North America, but it's worth checking out again, all the same. It's a classic format for the series, with the title and sword/shield symbol pasted against a gold-y beige backdrop. Perhaps not the most stunning design out there, but it has become somewhat synonymous with Zelda over the years.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="1787e45990e19"><a title="Zelda: Link's Awakening - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1787e45990e19/zelda-links-awakening-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3033-the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like the DX version, the Japanese variant for the original GB release swaps in original art of Link, Marin and Tarin against the backdrop of Koholint Island. Link's springing into action in this one, leaping through the air with his sword held aloft, while the other pair lounge around behind. It's bright, fun, and colourful — an almighty departure from the Western cover, no?</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting!

<p>It also made the "Top 10 Best-Selling Games" of last month</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="f5da65c95deea"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f5da65c95deea/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a new year, and following new releases in January 2026, Circana's Mat Piscatella has now shared chart data for the "Top 10 Best-Selling Premium Games" on Nintendo platforms in the US for this same month.</p>
<p>As you can see, Square Enix's latest Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> has debuted in second place, below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Keep in mind Nintendo's first-party titles here do not factor in the digital sales, and these charts do not include specific sales data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c1e00b021caf"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c1e00b021caf/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Mat Piscatella / Circana</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake also went from 225th place in December to 9th place in January - cracking the "Top 20 Best-Selling Premium Games" in the US for January 2026. This was thanks to the combined efforts of the Switch 2 and Xbox releases. Pokémon Legends: Z-A has dropped from sixth place to 16th place in the "Top 20" this month.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e096691b52300"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e096691b52300/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Mat Piscatella / Circana</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Piscatella has provided some additional information about hardware performance, revealing Switch 2 spending was able to offset year-on-year declines across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Switch. In saying this, PlayStation 5 still led the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hardware spending increased 16% when compared to a year ago, reaching $248M. Nintendo Switch 2 spending was able to offset year-on-year declines seen across PlayStation 5 (-17%), Xbox Series (-27%) and Switch (-79%).</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Despite sales falling compared to a year ago, PlayStation 5 led the hardware market in both unit and dollar sales during January 2026. Nintendo Switch 2 ranked 2nd across both measures."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> recently got a release date for the Switch 2. There's also a demo you can check out for the first game via the Switch eShop, and if you want to know even more about it, be sure to read (or watch) our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>In the lead up to Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebration, Nintendo officially lifted the lid on the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a>.</p>
<p>They're arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, and ahead of this release, Nintendo has shared not only an official trailer but also some direct screenshots, showing off how both games will look on its hybrid system.</p>
<p>As we previously mentioned, Nintendo has also confirmed these Switch releases contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">the same content as the original releases</a>, with some modern solutions to the connectivity features. You can also play these titles while using the GameChat feature.</p>
<p>If you somehow haven't played these monster-catching RPG before, as you can see below, it's a mix of adventure, exploration and battling wrapped up in some lovely pixel artwork! So, without further ado, here's a look:</p>
