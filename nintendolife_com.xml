<figure data-uuid="b5fc6f7f14faa"><a title="Virtual Boy 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5fc6f7f14faa/virtual-boy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Given that fans were expecting (or perhaps hoping, to be more accurate) to see DS games added to Switch Online, the upcoming inclusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> on <strong>17th February 2026</strong> is quite possibly the biggest surprise from Nintendo in recent years.</p>
<p>Did anyone really ask for this? Probably not. Is it pretty neat regardless? Definitely. Although the Virtual Boy's small library of games have been widely playable through, shall we say, 'unofficial' means, the headset itself isn't the easiest piece of hardware to come across these days.</p>
<p>So to finally go hands-on with the upcoming NSO variant of the Virtual Boy headset was both surreal and thrilling. I didn't get a great deal of time with it, but I managed to play enough to come away with five key takeaways. Needless to say, it reinforced my admittedly rash decision to pre-order the full-fat headset at <strong>£66.99 / $99.99</strong>, and I can't wait to get stuck in.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196709 @ 1770129002 -->
<h2><strong>The headset feels high-quality</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="751314974af8a"><a title="Virtual Boy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/751314974af8a/virtual-boy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is probably a given when you consider how much this thing is, but the Virtual Boy headset is really impressive from a build point of view. I was only able to handle it with a Switch 2 console already inserted, but it feels pretty weighty (while not being too heavy) and the dial you use to adjust the headset angle is strong and durable.</p>
<p>Even if you wind up not playing the NSO app all that much, the headset will make for a really eye-catching decoration to place on your desk or shelf. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>If the replica is a little pricey for you, there is also the cardboard version coming on the same day — though I didn't get to try that one out.</p>
<h2><strong>The lack of a Virtual Boy controller sucks</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="d58b52299d9c7"><a title="Virtual Boy Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d58b52299d9c7/virtual-boy-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see Nintendo add this later down the line (gotta squeeze every penny, y’know?), but I think it’s a real shame that the proper Virtual Boy headset doesn’t come bundled with a matching controller. I can understand the cardboard variant not including one, but I really wish we could get the complete Virtual Boy experience if I’m paying top dollar for it.</p>
<p>My hands-on session utilised the Joy-Con 2 nestled within the grip, which wasn't ideal. I suspect using the Pro Controller will provide a better experience, but man… I need a proper Virtual Boy pad.</p>
<h2><strong>Once you fine-tune the screen view, it looks incredible</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="778d140af7dd2"><a title="Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/778d140af7dd2/mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I first wiggled my face into the Virtual Boy’s display, everything looked a bit off. The screen was tiny, and the focus was completely out of whack. I don’t know what the person testing it out before me was doing, but goodness, what a mess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, small software tweaks via certain prompts on the controller (similar to adjusting the controls in other NSO apps) allow you to customise the view, so you can shift the image left or right slightly to increase the focus, and you can increase the size of the screen so that it fits your entire viewpoint. Once you do this, the edges fade out slightly, almost as if they’re exceeding the boundaries of your peripheral vision. It looks really cool.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you wear glasses like I do, you'll probably be absolutely fine using the Virtual Boy. Unless they're massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a>-style frames.</p>
<h2><strong>You’ll need a really specific environment in which to play</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="54fbf2b353c10"><a title="Virtual Boy 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54fbf2b353c10/virtual-boy-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is true for the original Virtual Boy too, but if you want to play this thing for a reasonable length of time, you’ll need to set up the right environment. You can’t play it without placing the VB accessory upon a flat surface, and you’ll need to make sure you’re at the right height so that you’re neither stretching up or crouching down.</p>
<p>Case in point, the Virtual Boy I tried was set upon a counter while I was sat upon a pretty basic high stool. The height of the stool meant that I had to curve my back forwards in order to get low enough to use the headset. If you've ever popped your chin on one of those tonometer machines at the opticians, it's a similar setup. I’m getting old, man, it hurts to do this stuff!</p>
<p>I suspect the ideal solution would be to set it upon a desk, then use a height-adjustable chair to get in the right position. Angling the Virtual Boy to the optimum position does help a lot too, naturally.</p>
<h2><strong>Many of the Virtual Boy’s games are genuinely great</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="3c21836befda5"><a title="Virtual Boy Wario Land" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c21836befda5/virtual-boy-wario-land.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s no secret that the Virtual Boy failed spectacularly when it originally launched back in 1995. As such, you might be under the impression that its games just aren’t very good. Well, not so! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> is an incredible 2D platformer that makes spectacular use of perspective, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a> is a solid wireframe shoot-em-up with clear <strong>Star Fox</strong> inspirations.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to try <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a>, since neither of them will be available at launch. But the sheer fact that both will be fully playable for the first time <em>ever</em> is reason enough to celebrate. What a time to be alive.</p>

            <guid>1423960</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9fe39e760f36c"><a title="Pragmata 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fe39e760f36c/pragmata-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have to be honest, I really didn't expect to love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> as much as I do.</p>
<p>Early trailers were certainly intriguing, but from a gameplay standpoint, I thought it looked bland and uninspiring. Maybe Capcom’s uncharacteristically lengthy development for the game played a part (it was originally revealed in 2020), but it’s been sitting near the the bottom of my wish list for a pretty long time. I’m happy to say, however, that I was very, <em>very</em> wrong. After 40 minutes with Pragmata on Switch 2, I’m ready for more – much more.</p>
<p>Taking place in a futuristic space station of sorts, the demo introduces the basics with a few combat encounters and a sprinkling of light puzzles, all before ending with a challenging yet cinematic boss battle. Protagonists Hugh and his android companion Diana must work together to defeat their enemies, with the former focusing on ranged weaponry and the latter providing crucial support with a unique, engaging hacking mechanic that manifests in real time.</p>
<figure data-uuid="35c374d8d0a44"><a title="Pragmata 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35c374d8d0a44/pragmata-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before I even get onto the gameplay, I absolutely adore the relationship between Hugh and Diana. Several games have attempted to portray the father/daughter dynamic over the years, and they've often been laced with tragedy or drama that makes the father figure in particular seem overly gruff in nature. Hugh, by comparison, is lighthearted and whimsical, teaching Diana how to do a high five after defeating the demo's boss. It's lovely.</p>
<p>The bulk of Pragmata controls like your average third-person shooter. You navigate Hugh through the environment (with Diana sitting comfortably atop his back), jumping up ledges, dashing to dodge attacks, and chipping away at your enemies’ health with a basic pistol. You can pick up beefier weapons on the fly, but these tend to come loaded with pretty limited ammunition, with the game often encouraging you to mix up your loadout.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the hacking, Pragmata probably <em>would</em> be a bit bland. But by targeting your enemies, you instantly initiate a real-time minigame in which you navigate a 4x4 grid with the right analogue stick.</p>
<p>Your main goal is to move through this grid and locate the green completion tile, while other tiles offer up additional perks along the way. Some, however, immediately kick you out if you accidentally land on them, so you’ll need to quickly load it up again and start from scratch.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a9b59df51c489"><a title="Pragmata 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9b59df51c489/pragmata-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key is to create a path and activate every available bonus before completion in order to dish out maximum damage. While this probably sounds simple on paper, it’s all done in an average of about 3 or 4 seconds with no pause in the action, so you’ll need to complete each hack while keeping a close eye on your positioning and what your enemies are doing.</p>
<p>The combination results in an incredibly satisfying gameplay loop that has the potential to keep me hooked throughout the entire game. It also, however, has the potential to be somewhat repetitive if this is really all there is to it. My gut says that it’s not, and that Pragmata will introduce a bunch of fresh twists on the concept as the story progresses. For now, however, I’m quite eager to jump back in as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the combat, some light puzzle-solving focused entirely on Diana's hacking abilities. These consisted almost entirely of activating nodes within the environment to open doorways or activate elevators. Like the combat encounters, each hack brings up a separate UI, so you might have to simply tap a combination of face buttons as displayed on-screen, or use 'ABXY' to rotate arrows so that they're facing the right direction. It's not taxing in the slightest, but it's quick and intuitive.</p>
<figure data-uuid="16ab65c264ad8"><a title="Pragmata 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/16ab65c264ad8/pragmata-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for how it runs on the Switch 2, Pragmata is about as good as I could reasonably expect. It was only available in docked mode with the performance locked at 30fps, but it felt pretty stable and consistent during my time with it. There are a few visual downgrades compared to the likes of PS5 with some muddy textures and a slightly fuzzy resolution, but it’s a handsome game nonetheless with impressive lighting and a strong art style.</p>
<p>All eyes are on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> for this year, but Pragmata definitely has the potential to be something really special come <strong>24h April 2026</strong>. Unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami</a>, it feels like Capcom is making a real solid attempt to create its next big IP here, and while it certainly still has much to prove – I didn’t get a whole lot of narrative context during the demo, for example – its gameplay has done more than enough to bump it up to the top tier of my ever-growing wish list.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Preview: So Far, Super Mario Bros. Wonder On Switch 2 Isn't Making A Great Case For Itself]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/so-far-super-mario-bros-wonder-on-switch-2-isnt-making-a-great-case-for-itself</link>
            <guid>1423888</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e0fbf79984e66"><a title="Bellabel Park 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0fbf79984e66/bellabel-park-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> launched in 2023, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Finally, after a deluge of perfectly serviceable yet uninspiring ‘<strong>New</strong>’ entries, it felt like 2D Mario had gotten its mojo back. Fast-forward to 2026 and Wonder is making its grand return with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> on <strong>26th March</strong>, but after recently going hands-on with the multiplayer segment, I have to admit that it’s yet to conjure up any excitement within me.</p>
<p>I should caveat this immediately by clarifying that I’m not the biggest fan of multiplayer games in the first place. I’m at my happiest when I’m able to just block out the real world and get lost in a game with no outside distractions, so do keep that in mind when reading my thoughts. If you <em>are</em> partial to some multiplayer mayhem, then you may well feel that the ‘Meetup at Bellabel Park’ additions are worth it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2eb2168b1edbf"><a title="Bellabel Park 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2eb2168b1edbf/bellabel-park-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My session consisted of one co-op mode and three PvP modes (or 'attractions', as the game calls them). The first makes use of the Switch 2’s Mouse Mode, with two players directly controlling characters, and two more creating Donut Blocks on the fly to allow passage across wide gaps and directly manipulate the trajectory of enemy attacks. It was… fine. It kind of hints towards some of the potential for a <strong>Mario Maker</strong> game that utilises mouse controls, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>In practice, having two players create Donut Blocks at the same time makes for a pretty messy, confusing experience, since you’re constantly at odds with one another regarding where to actually place the blocks. In addition, if you accidentally move vertically when placing your blocks, you might find yourself completely blocking the way forward for your player-controlled companions. In this instance, you’ll need to make some more blocks in a random corner of the screen in order to cause your previous creations to eventually disappear. As I said, it's very messy.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e48af1b58e1e6"><a title="Bellabel Park 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e48af1b58e1e6/bellabel-park-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two of the three PvP modes were racers, with one seeing you speed through the air on a flying vehicle, and the other rolling everybody up into balls and subsequently using physics to bounce you across the map. They last for about a minute at a time, tops, and although there’s a brief thrill in witnessing a photo finish and seeing who comes out on top via the results page, it’s all pretty forgettable stuff. I struggle to imagine many people jumping into these modes more than a handful of times.</p>
<p>And finally, the last PvP mode I played was essentially a game of hide and seek. Three players jump into Lakitu Clouds and fly around. When you press ‘A’, you can make your character invisible, effectively blending your Lakitu Cloud with dozens of others dotted around the screen. The person who’s ‘it’ will then try to find you, shooting out puffs of magic to help reveal your location. If you’re caught, you become ‘it’ – simple. The aim of the game is to remain hidden until the time runs out, so there's a frantic rush within the last 20 seconds or so to stay out of reach.</p>
<p>It’s a laugh, but again, if I mentally take myself away from the highly curated environment in which I tested these modes out, am I really going to bother with these in the comfort of my own home? Honestly, probably not.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2f03af36c9c71"><a title="Bellabel Park 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f03af36c9c71/bellabel-park-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might think differently, but all of the modes felt like minigames you might play in a <strong>Mario Party</strong> title. Taken within that context, they could be a lot of fun, but as standalone games that you have to consciously choose from the Bellabel Park overworld, they lack substance and feel throwaway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task.</p>
<p>There's definitely more to the Switch 2 Edition, including challenges via the Toad Brigade, the return of The Koopalings, an Assist mode — something which should help with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work">an issue I encountered with my daughter</a> in the base game — and of course, playable Rosalina. Though whether these features warrant an upgrade remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also had a chance to briefly check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR4W3e-_3zs">Talking Flower</a>, uh... toy? Yeah, let's go with toy. It honestly wasn't the best environment in which to test it out; I really had to strain to hear what it was saying. Regardless, it's a fine little thing if you're after a charming little accessory for your office desk.</p>
<p>Sorry... what do you mean it's meant for kids? Don't be silly.</p>
