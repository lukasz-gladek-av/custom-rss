<p>In case you somehow missed it, Nintendo's next big Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> is launching on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Nintendo this week aired a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">special Direct broadcast</a> to showcase all the new features from Mii customisation, island customisation to the Palette House, and it's got us wondering how you're feeling about the new entry at this point.</p>
<p>Is it a day one purchase, are you not completely sold yet, or is it just not your kind of game?

<p>One aspect of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> we thought was "excellent" was the music. With this in mind, it's been announced the game's soundtrack will be getting a physical release in Japan on <strong>17th April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It will include five CDs and a total of <strong>148 tracks</strong>. The good news is this also extends to the game's DLC expansion <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, which launched at the end of last year. Along with this, it comes with a full-colour 36-page booklet, and as a purchase bonus, there's a wire key ring featuring three acrylic charms.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7ihgpnx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"This is a complete version of 148 songs, including background music found in "Pokémon LEGENDS ZA" and "Pokémon LEGENDS ZA M-Dimension Rush," as well as past songs used in the games!"</p>

<p>There's no mention of a local release at this stage, but if we hear any updates (or pre-orders are made available elsewhere for local trainers), we'll share an update.</p>

<p>Following a response from AdHoc Studio</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="af43581ad9511"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af43581ad9511/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The superhero comedy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dispatch">Dispatch</a> is out on the Switch and Switch 2 this week and as we've already highlighted in our review, the 'Visual Censorship' toggle has been removed from the Nintendo versions of the game, meaning censorship is automatically activated with no option to change it.</p>
<p>We reached out to the developer AdHoc Studio <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">earlier this week</a> to ask what was up, and received the following response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AdHoc Studio:</strong> <em>"Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. For our Switch release, we worked with Nintendo to adapt certain elements so Dispatch could be on their platform."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo has got an official statement</a> about "Dispatch's censorship" after contacting Nintendo. Here's what it had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated by Nintendo here, games on its platforms must be rated and meet its established guidelines. And while it informs its partners when titles don't meet its guidelines, it "does not make changes to partner content" and also won't discuss the content or criteria used to make determinations.</p>
<p>If there are any other notable developments, statements, or sudden changes, we'll provide an update, but for now, these are the official responses each party has provided. Unsurprisingly, this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">hasn't stopped fans</a> <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/eurogamer-dispatch-on-switch-1-2-is-permanently-censored-possibly-mandated-by-nintendo.1418761/page-18#post-150688015">and gaming communities from speculating</a> about what else might be going on here. Some outlets have also shared theories that factor in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-and-this-might-be-the-reason/">local ratings boards</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the removal of these "visual censorship" settings, Dispatch on the Switch and Switch 2 still had us hooked until the bitter end with the potential of its ever-changing arcs. You can find out more about the game in our full review, and read more about the removal of the toggle in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">our previous story</a>.</p>

As much as fans appreciated this early play test, it's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/yakuza-fan-concerns-come-to-a-head-over-dodgy-kiwami-3-graphics">also drawn some criticism</a>.</p>
<p>Some players had been highlighting "graphical issues" and other problems and in response to this, RGG has now <a href="https://x.com/RGGStudio/status/2017040175180796074">shared an official message</a> on social media, mentioning how the "graphical quality" and other issues in the demo are not representative of the "final experience", with a patch to be made available at launch. Here's the message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have heard concerns from players regarding graphical issues and other problems present in the downloadable demo for Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties.</p>
<p>Rest assured the graphical quality of the demo does not represent the final experience. We plan to have a v1.11 patch available at launch which will address the lighting issue and other quality concerns in the full game.</p>
<p>One specific example is the visual and lighting issues around the Kubochi River area in the Downtown Ryukyu area, which many of you have already pointed out.</p>
<p>This patch will include not just fixes for the issues identified above, but many other improvements. We look forward to sharing the final version of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties with our global audience on February 12th.</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued support of the Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza series.</p>
<p>RGG Studio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the Version 1.11 patch will also include "many other improvements" although details about what exactly can be expected have not been revealed just yet. The rollout of this patch will also vary by platform. If you haven't already tried out this demo, it gives you access to both Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties. Check out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-scores-a-switch-2-eshop-demo-this-week">previous post for more details</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="7bd695591b7e3"><a title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Hugh and Bubbles" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7bd695591b7e3/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-hugh-and-bubbles.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> Nintendo Direct has won over many hearts, with its bizarre humour, huge amount of freedom and flexibility with customisation, and even a a dramatic romantic storyline.</p>
<p>We fell in love with Hugh Morris, the clown-like character from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo of America presentation</a> (who doesn't want to talk about monster trucks, sadly). But when we announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-moves-in-on-switch-1-this-april">our love for him</a>, a lot of people were quick to ask, "wait, <em>who?</em> What about Bubbles?"</p>
<p>Many readers were then quick to point out that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">Nintendo UK version</a> of the Direct had an entirely different set of characters and Miis, with slightly different storylines playing out between the cast.</p>
<p>Regional variants for Nintendo Directs are pretty common, but that's usually for general Directs. Japan often gets trailers for games we don't, and vice versa. And while the content in both the UK and US Directs is largely the same, the stars are sometimes very different.</p>

<p>Bubbles the Clown is one such example, but he's not the only UK-exclusive character: Rosa is your best friend instead of Jess in the UK stream, and Forian is a gym rat in Blighty while Patrick loves the guitar in the USA.</p>
<p>Hey, Carlo's in both of them! But he's presented a bit differently depending on what Direct you're watching: in the UK, he's very nosy and active, while the US version is a barista. And at least Mocha the Bear remains in tacts on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Other changes are a bit more subtle — the Hot Dog costume is featured in the American Direct, but a Wizard and Bee costume take centre stage in the UK. More grocery items are shown off in the US Direct, and different rooms and decors are highlighted in both versions. And instead of your best friend trying to get in on the romance in the ferris wheel, the UK version makes sure the alien is a part of the action.</p>
<p>Reader Suketoudara also pointed us towards <a href="https://youtu.be/xDKM6ygU1BE?si=J_4prQRZJMfn8yex">a video by rockheadHD</a>, comparing the localisation of both the US and UK versions of the game. And they're pretty different!</p>
<p>The most-obvious place is during the News Report segment where the newsreader talks about the stories on-air in slightly different ways, depending on which version you're watching. Whether this is the case in the full release, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Otherwise, of the European streams appear to use the UK version (with subtitles, of course), but as you're probably expecting at this point, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgPZ0h3B4U">Japan's version</a> was also slightly different to ours.</p>
<p>Once again, the cast of characters are very different to the English-language streams — we picked up on Rika, Daisuke (who plays guitar like Patrick), and <em>another</em> variation of Carlo, this time a painter.</p>
<p>The grocery store was where many of the biggest differences were, with food items like pizza, coffee, and escargot replaced by octopus, juice, and rice bowls.</p>

<p>The content of all three Directs we've highlighted is otherwise the same, bar these examples we've pointed out. And they're all delightful and tonally weird in their own ways. We've only spotted a handful of small differences in all of them, and there's bound to be tons we've missed, so let us know if you've spotted anything that stands out to you!</p>
<p>You won't have to wait long to live the dream on Switch, as Tomodachi Life: living the Dream comes out on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>.</p>
