<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/64541">Famitsu</a> has shared the latest look at physical sales in the region, and it's Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> that has come out on top with 23,428 units sold in its debut week. That's not a particularly high number, it's true, but considering that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> came in second with almost 14 thousand, it's not bad going.</p>
<p>A couple of other new releases also broke into the top 10 this time, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> and Broccoli's <strong>UN:LOGICAL</strong> making the cut at fifth and sixth, respectively.</p>
<p>Here's the latest top ten physical sales in Japan:</p>

<p>Expectedly, the Switch 2 has remained on top of the hardware side of things, with an additional ~72,000 units under its belt. The standard Switch model sold marginally more than the OLED this week, interestingly, but neither was enough to overtake the PS5 Digital Edition or the Switch Lite.</p>
<p>Combining the three SKUs for Switch this time gives us a total of 17,515, while the trio of PS5 models combine for 9,766.</p>

<figure data-uuid="f3fc8a98f2e28"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Peach Winking" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3fc8a98f2e28/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-peach-winking.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 is approaching its eight-month anniversary, and developers across the world are interested in getting their games on the newest gaming system out there. At least, that's what <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">GDC's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a> reveals (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/twice-as-many-developers-surveyed-by-gdc-say-they-want-to-make-games-on-ps5-or-switch-2-than-on-xbox/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>The report shows that 39% of developers surveyed are at least interested in the Switch 2. That puts it fourth, but barely, as the PS5 and Steam Deck are both at 40%, while PC is way ahead at 80%.</p>
<p>Looking at a few other platforms, the Switch 2 is almost twice as popular as the Xbox Series X | S, which only 20% of the sample of developers are apparently interested in. The original Switch console still has some eyes on it, too, with 13% of developers still keen to develop for the system</p>
<p>In terms of platforms that developers have used to release their most recent games, the Switch consoles are a little lower down — 21% of devs have released a Switch game, with 18% getting their game on the newer Switch 2, from those surveyed. Both are behind the Xbox One, which sits at 23%.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch is a much-less powerful system than other consoles, and the Switch 2 has only been out since June 2025, so those numbers will likely go up this time next year, and as more developers get their hands on dev kits.</p>

<p>But the numbers for the Switch consoles here are a little closer, because more people have a Switch 1 than Switch 2. And that's backed up by a further poll, where developers and companies surveyed were asked what they consider most when choosing a platform to release their game on.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the top result was audience reach, with 78% of developers picking that option. Business model success and discoverability also ranked highly, with 44% and 43% of votes respectively. So it's all down to easy-of-access and past successes, then.</p>
<p>So, it's a pretty good start for the new console, in our eyes. And with a third-party-stacked 2026 ahead of us, we think things can only go up from here. Or, we hope, at least.</p>
