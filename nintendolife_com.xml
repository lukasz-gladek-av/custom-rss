<figure><a title="Koraidon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/784a3178f6074/koraidon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japanese automotive manufacturer Honda has unveiled the Pokémon Koraidon motorbike during the Suzuka 8 Hours motorcycle endurance race on Sunday, and uh... Well, it looks about as elegant as you could reasonably expect.</p>
<p>The vehicle is aided by the Honda Riding Assist system, which means it's able to operate and move independently. You can check this out in the video below, but don't expect blistering speeds out of this one. The bike is equipped with stabilisers, presumably to simply keep it upright, but it's moving at an almost laughably slow speed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5xprozl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Granted, we were never expecting the Koraidon bike to achieve record-breaking speeds, but we definitely had something a <em>little</em> more impressive in mind.</p>
<p>Still, the actual design is pretty cool, but we can't imagine Honda actually making proper production models of the bike anytime soon. It seems this is definitely a one-off to promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> for the Switch.</p>

<figure><a title="RTA Japan - DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c519742fe14b6/rta-japan-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japan's largest speedrunning event, <a href="https://rtain.jp/">RTA</a>, is set to kick off later this week on 9th August, and will see some of the speediest gamers in the biz ploughing through the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier: Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>, all in aid of Doctors Without Borders. We learnt a few months ago that Nintendo games would not be included in the lineup, and now the RTA group has explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/">RTA website</a> (and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-owned-titles-excluded-from-japans-biggest-speedrunning-event-after-organizers-were-told-they-had-to-apply-for-permission-for-each-game/">Automaton</a>), the event organisers explain that they were contacted by Nintendo back in June, informing them that "as a legal entity, they would have to ask for permission in advance" if they wanted to feature any Nintendo game in the event. What's more, the Big N apparently stated that all previous instances of Nintendo games being streamed from the event are now considered "unauthorised use".</p>
<p>RTA has long featured Nintendo games in its lineup — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> is a staple, natch — but the Big N's interest this year seems to stem from the event's relatively recent (2020) transition into an official legal entity. The event remains non-profit, with all proceeds going to charity.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't necessarily the end of Nintendo's RTA appearances completely — the organisers state that they are working with Nintendo to get game permission for future events — but the proximity to the Summer 2025 event meant that the team couldn't possibly get all permissions through and approved in time.</p>
<p>It's disappointing to hear that RTA speedrunners won't get to take a pop at Mario &amp; co. this year, though it's hardly surprising. Let's not forget that Nintendo has historically been <em>very</em> cagey about which events can and cannot feature its titles. It <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/nintendo-releases-full-statement-after-cancellation-of-smash-world-tour">cancelled the Smash World Tour</a> back in 2022, and we regularly hear reports of streamers and other events that have been similarly hit by the ninjas.</p>
<p>Let's hope the permission-giving goes smoothly for RTA next year.</p>

<figure><a title="ludocene launch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bffa8d29ec6cc/ludocene-launch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ludocene</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/new-dating-app-for-games-tool-looks-to-leverage-human-expertise-over-ai">We reported on Ludocene</a> back in February, when the new search tool for video games was looking for backers for its Kickstarter campaign, which then went on to find enough supporters that it's launching a whole month early. Hooray! In fact, it's launching <em>today</em>, which is <a href="https://www.playday.org.uk/">National Playday</a> here in the UK. What are the chances?!</p>
<p>We've been very impressed with what we've seen from <a href="https://www.ludocene.com/">Ludocene</a> thus far; it all looks very nice and swishy, like a fancy Apple-designed Tinder but for finding games to love. Y'know the vibe.</p>
<p>And we're not just saying that because founder Andy Robertson is also behind <a href="https://www.familygamingdatabase.com/home">Family Gaming Database</a>, whose family-friendly ratings you can find in some of our reviews here at Nintendo Life. No, this genuinely seems really cool and useful, actually.</p>
<p>Essentially, what the app does is take your game-related initial search and construct a deck of suitable games around it. But rather than just being a simple filter affair, there's lots of effort been put in here to get the guidance of a bunch of gaming industry professionals. So you can have bespoke decks of games to check out, enhanced by pointers from folk who've proper melted their minds playing stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some more deets about the launch from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What Ludocene does:</strong></p>
<p>Presents a stream of Game cards<br>
You swipe to Love/Discard and build your deck.<br>
We suggest matching games for you to Pin.<br>
Add Expert cards for specific gaming taste.<br>
<strong><br>
Ludocene has been built to solve the challenge of finding what to play when over 1000 games launch every month. It does this not with AI or heavy algorithms but meticulously researched data built over the last five years:</strong></p>
<p>Free and ad-free to use, including all game cards.<br>
All human-researched data, rather than heavy algorithms or AI.<br>
Mobile and Desktop web-app.<br>
Save your runs and suggestions across both.<br>
Supported by a subscription tier (£3.99/month) that grants Discord access, more experts and monthly digest emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that's got this writer particularly interested in this, even as someone who considers themselves fairly well-read on games, is the idea that you have a sort of game built into the thing itself, with all of the experts to choose from and, as the press release puts it " the ability to create as many game-finding runs as you need." As the sorts of people who sit browsing game stores for absolutely no reason a lot of the time, this sounds like it's threatening us with a good time.</p>
<p>Right, we're off to type "games for when you need coffee really badly" into this thing. Let's see what these boffins come up with.</p>
