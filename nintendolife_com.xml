<p>Nintendo has today announced it's releasing a new line of Mario-themed products, videos and even an app designed for parents and their children.</p>
<p>The free smart device and Switch app is officially titled '<strong>Hello, Mario!</strong>' and allows kids to interact with Mario's face. Based on the description, it sounds a bit like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> start menu feature, allowing you to interact with a 3D version of Mario's head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A free smart device app and Nintendo Switch software that children can play intuitively by pulling Mario’s face, or turning it around and around on the screen. Mario will react in various ways based on the player’s input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This app will be made available for free on both of these platforms on <strong>26th August 2025</strong> and is published by Nintendo. It will require "iOS 15 or Android 6.0 or later" to play.</p>
<p>As for the rest of this "My Mario" line, Nintendo is also releasing two wooden block sets and a 'Hello, Mario!' Board Book. One small but interesting detail about the wooden block sets is that each of the characters can be used as an amiibo figure in "compatible games".</p>
<figure><a title="My Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e9da87cfe5755/my-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>3 pieces for 2,980 yen and 30 pieces for 19,980 yen — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Along with this, it's also got some visual content lined up, including a series of 'It's Me, Mario!' stop-motion short videos.</p>
<p>This will feature Mario showing off "a variety of expressions and movements" with each video approximately one minute in length. These will air for free on the 'My Mario' official website and "other" channels.</p>
<figure><a title="My Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e80dea842cbfa/my-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo also has some other products planned such as apparel, general goods and plush toys. This same series is scheduled to be released outside of Japan at the beginning of <strong>2026</strong>. This news arrives ahead of Mario's 40th anniversary celebrations this September.</p>

<p>Patents don't always lead to something, but it's still interesting to see what companies might be up to or at least thinking about behind closed doors.</p>
<p>In the case of Switch 2, Nintendo has already delivered some unique features like Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, and now a few other ideas have seemingly surfaced. This information comes from the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025163860">World Intellectual Property Organization</a> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lvtbv7atlk2l">via Nintendo Patents Watch on social media</a>), which highlights attachments for a "crank" and what's described as a "clickable wheel".</p>
<p>The crank has a "rotary disc which is tracked by the mouse sensor through a window", with two magnets securing the attachment. According to the same source, the "clickable wheel" rotation is tracked by the mouse sensor via a gear train and "its click is transmitted to the SL button". This attachment also includes a second button to press the SR button.</p>

<p>As for what this could lead to...one obvious guess is some sort of fishing-like accessory and game. Some other suggestions online are joking about Nintendo channelling the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/playdate-picking-things-up-where-the-game-boy-left-off?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Playdate's crank</a>. If we do see anything come of this, or get more information about what might be going on here, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>And it's out now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you thought the day's surprises were over, think again, as Bethesda, id Software, and retro specialists Nightdive Studios have announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, the "definitive re-release" of two classic spell shooters. Oh, and it's also out <em>right now</em> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/heretic-hexen-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>For just $14.99 (it's not up on the EU eShop at the time of writing this), you'll be able to pick up two of Raven Software's iconic first-person shooters which introduced inventory systems, vertical aiming, and character classes to the genre.</p>
<p>Heretic originally launched in 1994 on PC and was made in the DOOM engine; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hexen">Hexen</a> is a direct sequel that followed in 1995 and got a Nintendo 64 release in North America in 1997.</p>
<p>This release bundles together all of the games' content — <strong>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders</strong>, <strong>Hexen: Beyond Heretic</strong>, and <strong>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</strong> — plus two new episodes created by Nightdive and id Software: <strong>Heretic: Faith Renewed</strong> and <strong>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</strong>.</p>
<p>But, given that it's Nightdive at the helm, you probably want to see all the shiny new enhancements, right? Here they are (from the eShop page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong><br>
• Online cross-platform and local split-screen deathmatch and co-op modes<br>
• Toggleable enhanced soundtrack from Andrew Hulshult<br>
• In-game mod support (Nintendo Switch™ only supports featured mods, curated by the team at id.)<br>
• An array of accessibility options, quality-of-life improvements, and engine fixes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nightdive Studios just continue to keep impressing — we've only <em>just</em> got our mitts on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, so it looks like we'll be dipping into Nightdive's seemingly endless pool of retro rereleases once again.</p>
