<p>And he'd love to make another soundtrack, "if asked"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="hip tanaka" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/156b6e5e3f525/hip-tanaka.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6S7C9Sh7xE&amp;ab_channel=ChipTanaka">Hip Tanaka</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Those lovely folks over at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/legendary-nintendo-composer-hip-tanaka-says-hed-love-to-make-another-full-game-soundtrack-if-asked/">VGC</a> spoke to the one and only Hirokazu Tanaka — better known as 'Hip' or 'Chip' Tanaka — at Bitsummit's Indie Game Event in Kyoto last month and, it seems, the main man may well be up for making some sweet new music, if somebody asks. Would somebody just let him make some new music quickly, please, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Tanaka, who you might know as the composer behind soundtracks for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/kid_icarus">Kid Icarus</a> and the Game Boy version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a>, to name just a few things he's got on the old CV. He worked on the soundtracks for both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a>. Oh, and he also played a key role in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poca-is-a-game-boy-camera-photobook-adventure-and-a-heartfelt-homage-to-hip-tanaka">creating and designing the Game Boy</a>. So, yeah, he's kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Mr Tanaka, who was in-house with Nintendo working on music all through the 8- and 16-bit eras, left the company and ended up as President of Creatures Inc after his work on the <strong>Pokémon</strong> anime became a conflict of interest for Nintendo.</p>
<p>And so it's delightful to hear, and doubly so given that Chip's work has shifted away from music somewhat since the move from Nintendo, that he's all in on returning to it. Speaking to VGC, when asked if he'd be into making another videogame soundtrack, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, if somebody came up to me and said ‘hey, do you want to make music for a game?’ I’d say ‘yeah, sure, sounds like fun...There’s a studio called 17-Bit making a game called <strong>Awaysis</strong>, created by a guy called Jake (Kazdal), and I actually made a track for that game. I’m not the only person making music for that game, there’s a bunch of us, but I created a track for it, and I’m playing it tomorrow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When then asked if he'd prefer to make single tracks or a full soundtrack, the musical maestro responded that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, to correct that [previous answer], I didn’t just do one song for Awaysis, I’m doing 70-80% of the game...But I think, for me, I spent my 20s to around 40 or so just making game music, and since then I’ve spent about 20 years where I haven’t really made any, so it’s kind of (about) getting back into it right now."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanaka also confirmed that he actually composed a track for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> saying, <em>“So if anybody comes up to me and says ‘hey, can you do this’, I’d be like ‘yes, I’d love to’.</em> Now, let's check out Mr Tanaka's contribution to Street Fighter 6, 'Glorious Match'!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>So, who's gonna give the man a job writing a new soundtrack? Let us know your thoughts!</em></p></section>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1c019541f4a5/super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Five years ago, Nintendo made an appropriately big thing of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>' 35th anniversary, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/09/nintendo_announces_super_mario_remasters_and_much_more_in_super_mario_bros_35th_anniversary_direct">a bespoke Direct</a> broadcast featuring a bunch of new games and, naturally, merch celebrating the Famicom release of video gaming's most famous platformer on 13th September 1985.</p>
<p>Half a decade on and the 40th anniversary is just over a month away. With Switch 2 out in the wild and a Mario platformer-shaped gap in Nintendo's announced lineup, it feels natural that there would be similar celebrations planned for this year. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_bros_35">Super Mario Bros. <del>35</del> 40</a>, anyone?</p>
<p>There are some easy gimmes Nintendo could put out — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> updates, a new Lego set, a bunch of swag with 'Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary' plastered all over it — and with DK ably taking on 3D platformer duties in the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>, the need for the brand new 3D Mario game we've all been waiting for since 2017's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> isn't <em>quite</em> as desperate as it was at the start of the year. But still, the door is wide open for all sorts of plumber-related news.</p>
<p>Realistically, we're a few weeks away from any potential announcements, but let's take a look at what Team NL predicts Nintendo is cooking up for SMB's 40th...</p>
<h2>Super Mario Maker 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Ludicrously Long Title Addendum That's Totally Impractical For Any Normal Person To Say Or Even Remem— (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Maker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d48df7d5e3761/mario-maker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's coming up on four decades of SMB, it's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_maker">Super Mario Maker</a>'s 10th anniversary on 10th September. Seeing as it's already a celebration of the series, I've got my money on a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker 2</a>, which adds in a Wonder theme and some Mouse Mode controls.</p>
<p>Sticking to anniversary-related releases (hey, where would games media be without a good old 'It's now been longer since X than it was between Y and Z', huh?), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi's Island</a> turns 30 on 5th August. Now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/soapbox_25_years_on_i_still_cant_get_into_yoshis_island">I've never been a big fan</a> — beyond the stellar art — due to wailing baby anxiety, but can you imagine what a 4K sequel could look like?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know there have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshis_island_ds">Island</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yoshis_new_island">sequels</a> already, but let's not talk about those. I'm thinking something more along the lines of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">Link Between Worlds</a> to the original's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">Link to the Past</a>, not a wet fart to Yoshi's Island's...</p>
<p>Hmm, I've gotten myself in trouble with an analogy and a game I don't even like very much, Alana. Hilfe, bitte...</p>
<h2>Weird Mario, please (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="DDR: Mario Mix" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e555c6997d524/ddr-mario-mix.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hooo boy, I'm going to forgo all of the obvious things here; yes, it's time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_golf">Mario Golf</a>. Yes, it's time for a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Sluggers</a>. But where the heck is a new version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/dance_dance_revolution_mario_mix">Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</a>???</p>
<p>Okay, I'm not the target audience for a new DDR Mario game, but this gets to the core I want from Mario going forward — more <em>weird</em> Mario. The <strong>Mario RPG</strong>s and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> have been carrying the torch over the past few years, and with Nintendo's improved animations, I think it's time we got some of those unusual spin-offs on Nintendo Switch Online. Or a new game.</p>
<p>Realistically, we'll get a <strong>Mario Movie 2</strong> teaser, a 3D Mario tease... maybe a new Nintendo Switch 2 design? Let's be reasonable, folks!</p>

<h2>Space, Jam (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario 3-on-3 Hoops" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b64dcb8587cf/mario-3-on-3-hoops.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can keep your Golf, Sluggers, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_strikers_battle_league">Strikers</a>, and Olympic Game crossovers; there's only one sporting event that I want to see back in action come September, and that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a>.</p>
<p>I mean, come on. Basketball seems to be bigger around the world today than ever before, and the death of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nba_jam">NBA Jam</a> has left an arcade baller-shaped hole in all of our hearts. Give me a full-blown Mario Hoops revival, complete with high-flying dunks and silky smooth performance, and you've got yourself a winner.</p>
<p>If that's off the table, however, it seems only right that we get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on Switch 2 in <em>some form</em>. At this point, I honestly don't care if it's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">3D All-Stars</a> update or the announcement of a catchily-titled 'Super Mario 3D All-Stars + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition'. I'll do whatever it takes to play it on modern hardware.</p>

<h2>99 Marios and 1 Yoshi in a thong (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi's New Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/762268c5260f4/yoshis-new-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I reckon the smart money is on a remaster or upgrade of some sort for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy</a> games, or hey, I'd even take a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> with fancy new Switch 2 controls and gimmicks. Shouting "Pump it!" into the mic for paint to come out of your gun or something. I'll let the boffins figure out the fine details.</p>
<p>However, seeing as there's been so little fanfare thus far, maybe it's gonna be something totally different, something small-scale. Or maybe we'll get a brand new game, a whole new-ass Mario stealthing onto the scene, they could even call it New-Ass Mario, they can have that for free.</p>
<p>If I had my choice, I'd like to see where Nintendo would go with some sort of Mario 99 game, something challenging and unique. You know, jumping along a route and when you fall, you're out. Or, since we've just had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> drop on NSO, maybe they're testing the waters for a brand new version of that. I'd also like to see Mario Beach Volleyball. Come on, Nintendo, you know you want to put Yoshi in bikini bottoms.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Those are a few of our hopes, but what do you think Nintendo might roll out as Super Mario Bros. enters its fifth decade? Does <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario Land 3D</a> get a Deluxe port? Do we get a 1:1 of 1-1 in Lego form? Is it time for Mario's Broadway debut as we discover Miyamoto's been on a Gilbert and Sullivan binge?</em> <em>Let us know below.</em></p>
