<p>Step by step</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We had a good time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped">Biped</a> — the robo co-op platformer all about putting one foot in front of the other — when it arrived on Switch back in 2020, and what do you know, META Publishing has got even more up its sleeve.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped_2">Biped 2</a> is set to step onto Switch on <strong>5th November</strong>, and it looks every bit as full of Nintendo charm as its predecessor. Once again, the main gimmick here is to do with controlling a sweet little robot's left and right feet independently to get them walking in a straight line, but there are obstacles, drops, and platforms to contend with along the way.</p>
<p>Like that which came before it, Biped 2 can be played either in solo or two-player co-op — there's a new 'pair' mechanic that sees you sticking to your pal to solve puzzles — but the sequel also adds in a fresh <em>four-player</em> mode for those who really want to up the party vibes.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Biped-2-2950357.html">eShop</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ENJOY THE CONTROLS<br>
- Meet the classic two-leg mechanics and a brand-new variety of ways to move!<br>
- Try out new movement types that are smoothly integrated into the game process! Soar gracefully on a hang glider and leave beautiful patterns behind, or conquer ledges and breaks with a grappling hook!<br>
- And guess what? Sliding is back too! Be ready to slide a lot!</p>
<p>UNIQUE PAIR MECHANICS<br>
- Not only help each other to get further, but act together to achieve success! Unite with your robot partner and become one to solve special puzzles. Take the role of “legs” or “arms” and coordinate your next step. And a whole bunch of pair puzzles will help you to master this technique!</p>
<p>EXPLORE NEW BIOMES<br>
- Unknown planets bring uncharted places! Unravel the mysteries of an alien planet and meet new characters, even elementals! Explore unfamiliar environments and be ready to face the challenges that they might bring. Have a good time, and let beautiful scenery and wonderful music create a memorable atmosphere!</p>
<p>PLAY SOLO OR IN TWO-OR-FOUR-PLAYER CO-OP<br>
To make the gameplay process even more diverse, you can choose from lots of possibilities to play:<br>
- Single-player: Become a hero of your story and test your skills in a single-player mode!<br>
- Two-player co-op: Invite a friend to share the journey with you. Take the roles of two bipeds and make the most out of this synergy. Test your skills and assist each other in difficult situations because companionship will be essential.<br>
- Four-player co-op: Apart from familiar mods, we’ve introduced a new one - a four-player co-op! Beat the challenging levels together in a team of four!</p>
<p>STYLE IS A MUST<br>
- Show the new world your creativity! Dress up your bipeds for the occasion to impress your new friends - collect treasures and buy wacky hats. Be unique or choose pair looks with your partner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biped 2 will arrive on the Switch eShop next month for <strong>£16.75 / $19.99</strong>.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/biped">review</a> of its predecessor, we called Biped "a lovely co-op game that’s bursting with unique challenges and obstacles to overcome", though we did feel that it was a little on the short side.</p>

<p>WayForward's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae">Shantae</a> series has been expanded with all sorts of games over the years, and following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shantae-advance-risky-revolution">revival of the lost GBA title</a>, the series director Matt Bozon has now shared a major update.</p>
<p>The next Shantae game, which marks the seventh major title, is now officially in development. This was shared at the end of Limited Run's 10th anniversary broadcast this week, with Bozen mentioning how more details would be shared in the future. Here's what he had say, along with the attached image featuring Shantae and Risky Boots:</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fitymwl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The music app is now a year old</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="577d025e97be0"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/577d025e97be0/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or not, one thing every racer should <em>probably</em> agree on is that this new entry has an amazing soundtrack. If you are wondering why Nintendo hasn't added this album to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> service just yet, we've now got an official response.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/10/29/breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-nintendo-music/">The Washington Post [paywall]</a>, Nintendo's Bill Trinen acknowledged fan requests for this particular album, which is "particularly robust", and mentioned how soundtracks "actually take time and work" to prepare. It's also apparently about lining it up on the calendar and seeing if it fits. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t go into too much detail, but I can say that it does actually take time and work to prepare soundtracks for Nintendo Music. And that soundtrack is particularly robust. It’s a matter of looking at the calendar and saying whether something might fit in or not. We’ve certainly heard that people are eager to see that on Nintendo Music.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Mario Kart World's album isn't available on this subscription service just yet, you can listen to existing Mario Kart soundtracks. It's now also been one year since this music app was released for mobile devices, and during this time, Nintendo has bolstered the service with all sorts of retro albums, as well as some sample collections for Switch 2 titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>If you would prefer something more physical, Nintendo yesterday announced it was teaming up with Laced Records to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-is-scoring-a-gorgeous-vinyl-release-next-year">soundtrack on vinyl</a>. You can find out more in our previous post. Earlier this week, it also updated its digital music app with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> soundtrack.</p>
