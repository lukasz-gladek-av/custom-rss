<p>The ver. 2.1.2 patch is now live on Switch and Switch 2. This one doesn't come with any added content, as we have seen from previous updates, but the dev has focused on fixing a fresh wave of bugs across all platforms, targeting issues in multiplayer, Snoozaland, fishing and more.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_2_1_2/">Fantasy Life website</a>, though you can also check them out below.</p>
<h2>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time ver. 2.1.2 (19th Feb 2026)</h2>
<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in multiplayer where the remaining buff uses were not consumed when guests harvested vegetables while "Gathering Up" or "Gathering/Crafting +" was active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where the line gauge would immediately drop to 0 when starting to fish with the Dark Dragon Fishing Rod or True Dark Dragon Fishing Rod equipped, causing the attempt to fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in Snoozaland where the map would not open when you were targeted by an enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in Snoozaland (3+ player multiplayer) where items from an Alchemy Robot could sometimes fall between rocks and could not be picked up.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where the remaining buff uses would be consumed once per vegetable when harvesting an entire field using actions such as Charge Attack while "Gathering Up" or "Gathering/Crafting +" was active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in Snoozaland where pressing the confirm button on a Warp Circle at the exact moment time ran out could send you to the boss area instead of Don's Dreamy Deals, blocking progression.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>The wonders of Paldea</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>You know we're closing in on the end of the month when The Pokémon Company lifts the lid on its next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> booster set, and today, we've got just that.</p>
<p>The Paldean Wonder themed booster packs will arrive in the app next week on <strong>26th February</strong> from <strong>1am GMT / 2am CET / 5pm PT (25th)</strong>. As you'd expect from that name, this set is all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>'s Gen IX and the Paldea region.</p>
<p>New Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly cards will be up for grabs, obviously, but the reveal has also given us a first look at a fresh full art Maushold, as well as two new Meowscarada and Gholdengo ex cards. Here's a closer look at a handful of the newbies:</p>


<p>It'll kick off what's likely to be quite a big week for Pokémon news. We're expecting the annual Pokémon Presents presentation on its usual date of 27th February, and with the 30th anniversary taking place this year, our fingers are crossed that it's going to be a big one.</p>

<p>Mira, Mira, on the wall</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well this is a nice surprise! Nintendo popped up out of the blue today to announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. The real treat? It's available <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, you can now head over to the eShop and pick up the latest addition to the 'Switch 2 Edition' roster for £54.99 / $64.99 (or £4.19 / $4.99, if you already own it on Switch 1). There's no new content to speak of this time, but you can expect to see things running at a smooth 60fps, with a crisp 4K resolution in docked mode — assuming your TV offers it.</p>
<p>Naturally, you might be wondering what this upgrade looks like compared to the Switch 1 version. Well, wonder no more, because we've got you covered. In the above video, Mr Alex Olney showcases the two versions running side by side for a neat cutscene comparison, before highlighting just how smoothly things perform in open world exploration and combat.</p>
<p>It's a marked improvement, we must admit, even if the 60fps boost has been rumoured for just about as long as the game has been on Switch. Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got some mech exploring (<em>mechsploring?</em>) to do.</p>
