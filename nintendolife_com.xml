In fact, it has put up the US' biggest physical game launch in over two years.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.circana.com/gb">Circana</a>'s Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">Bluesky</a>, who noted that the US hasn't seen a launch like Z-A's since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> arrived back on the scene in May 2023.</p>
<p>We should note that the data only accounts for "physical unit and dollar sales" and <em>not</em> digital or bundle purchases, but nonetheless, standing up there with TOTK — one of the most-anticipated games in recent memory — isn't bad going.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59yotvwh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, there might be a bit of you thinking "well, duh, it's Pokémon, <em>obviously</em> it sold well," and you'd be right... for the most part. As we alluded to earlier, Z-A's release numbers are far from what the series has mustered in the past. In Europe, the game's racked up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/uk-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-smallest-retail-launch-since-lets-go-in-europe">smallest retail launch for a mainline game</a> since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Let's Go! Pikachu and Let's Go! Eevee</a>, and while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/japanese-charts-surprise-surprise-pokemon-legends-z-a-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust">Japanese numbers</a> are impressive, it's <em>far</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>'s debut.</p>
<p>All this is to say, even a quieter Pokémon launch is still a rather big deal, in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<figure data-uuid="17cca6068e279"><a title="Super Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17cca6068e279/super-mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Eight years ago today, a little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> launched on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>We've said so much over the years about this incredible entry from Nintendo, we won't go over it all again here. But <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1982703457338540178">a recent post</a> from ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura caught our eye and we simply felt compelled to highlight it, if only for how old it instantly made us feel.</p>
<p>Imamura-san highlighted Odyssey's anniversary and drew an amusing comparison to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>. Essentially, eight years prior to the N64 classic puts Nintendo right in the middle of the Famicom/NES days. The company would subsequently launch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a> all before our favourite plumber would dive headfirst into the 3D realm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It’s unbelievable that this is a game from 8 years ago! Eight years before Super Mario 64 was still the heyday of the Famicom, and I myself was a student back then."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, since Odyssey, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Super Mario Maker 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>. Sigh... it's a different world we live in now, huh?</p>
<p>Naturally, we're confident Nintendo is simply taking its time to ensure it delivers a new 3D Mario title worthy of its remarkable legacy, but it just goes to show how quickly the company could churn out bonafide classics back in the '80s and '90s.</p>
<p>As we mentioned, however, if nothing else it just makes us feel so very, very old. How has it been eight years already? That's nearly a <em>decade</em>, for goodness' sake!</p>
