<p>What a surprise!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As a part of today's Xbox Gamescom showcase, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> dev Evil Empire finally lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, revealing that it will be coming to Switch and Switch 2 "later this year".</p>
<p>While every other platform landed the full release of this Prince of Persia roguelike today, we're pleased to see it finally confirmed for Switch. We've had this one on our radar since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/prince-of-persia-roguelite-from-dead-cells-dev-revealed-switch-not-confirmed">first revealed</a> early last year, and have been following it throughout its early access period ever since. A surprise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/dead-cells-devs-prince-of-persia-roguelike-has-been-rated-for-switch">Switch age rating</a> for the game popped up earlier this summer, but today's showcase if the first <em>official</em> confirmation that it will be coming our way.</p>
<p>If this is the first you've heard of this one, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a super stylish-looking roguelike, that is all about movement and combat. It packs in a bunch of familiar moves you'll likely recognise from the iconic Ubisoft series (hello, wall running), and shapes it into the 'one more run' format that Evil Empire so brilliantly hit upon in the past with Dead Cells' post-launch content.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of a game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Become the Prince of Persia</strong><br>
Flow seamlessly between platforming and combat, using your acrobatic skill to outmaneuver and outsmart your enemies. Run on the walls to open new routes of attack, avoid traps and explore hard to reach areas, or chain it with kicks, dodges and stomps to fight through swathes of enemies without a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Save your People</strong><br>
Awakening in an Oasis outside the capital after a furious battle with magic-wielding invaders, you rush to the city to stop the brutal invasion. When you die, your mysterious bola returns you back in time to the Oasis, ready to throw yourself into the fray again and again. Discover new areas, characters and knowledge through non-linear storytelling as you strive to find a way to save Persia.</p>
<p><strong>Choose your Playstyle</strong><br>
Switch between a wide variety of deadly weapons during each run and equip &amp; upgrade medallions to enhance both them and your moveset, unleashing devastating synergies. Change your loadout mid-run to adapt to new challenges or stick with your favourites – the choice is yours!</p>
<p><strong>No Two Runs are the Same</strong><br>
New weapons, medallions, difficulty modifiers &amp; more are unlocked with each run, so there’s always something new to explore. Every level is also procedurally generated - renewing the challenge with each foray into the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more information on the Switch and Switch 2 release in the coming months, but let's hope that we don't have to wait too long.</p>

<p>Threading the needle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You've read the title, you've seen photos of the booths online, so you know it's coming — six years after its last official public demo, we've <em>finally</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. And, we've played it on Switch 2, too.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's special broadcast tomorrow, 21st August, we — or, more specifically, the lovely Felix — has spent some hands-on time with the highly-anticipated sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it's only about 15-minutes or so, but that's 15 minutes more than we had before. So, was it worth the two-hour-long wait? (Yes, <em>two</em> hours)</p>
<p>Of the two demos available — one from near the beginning of the game in a green area, and another later in the game in a magma-filled stage — Felix picked the second one. And, as we've already confirmed, there's a 120fps mode.</p>
<p>There's more dialogue (given that Hornet speaks), more collectible, and different movement options. And, of course, Felix took on the demo's big boss, Lace. So, it's more Hollow Knight with more features, at least for now.</p>
<p><em>So, if you want your first look at Silksong on Switch 2, here's the place for it — check out Felix's video up-top and then let us know if you're looking forward to Silksong in the comments</em>.</p>
