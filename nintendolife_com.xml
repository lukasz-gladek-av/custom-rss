</section></header><section>

<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will launch on the Switch 2 in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Published by Bethesda Softworks and developed by MachineGames, the Xbox-owned release is the first major Switch 2 title from the publisher. We don't have a specific release date yet, but we'll be sure to let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Live the adventure as Indy in a thrilling story full of exploration, immersive action, and intriguing puzzles. As the brilliant archaeologist – famed for his keen intellect, cunning resourcefulness, and trademark humor – you will travel the world in a race against enemy forces to discover the secrets to one of the greatest mysteries of all time.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Travel from the halls of Marshall College to the heart of the Vatican, the pyramids of Egypt, the sunken temples of Sukhothai, and beyond. When a break-in in the dead of night ends in a confrontation with a mysterious colossal man, you must set out to discover the world-shattering secret behind the theft of a seemingly unimportant artifact. Forging new alliances and facing familiar enemies, you’ll engage with intriguing characters, use guile and wits to solve ancient riddles, and survive intense set-pieces.</p>
<p>-Indiana’s trademark whip remains at the heart of his gear and can be used to distract, disarm, and attack enemies. But the whip isn’t just a weapon, it’s Indy’s most valuable tool for navigating the environment. Swing over unsuspecting patrols and scale walls as you make your way through a striking world. Combine stealth infiltration, melee combat, and gunplay to combat the enemy threat and unravel the mystery .</p>
<p>- Venture through a dynamic mix of linear, narrative-driven gameplay and open-area maps. Indulge your inner explorer and unearth a world of fascinating secrets, deadly traps and fiendish puzzles, where anything could potentially hide the next piece of the mystery – or snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Block party</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>TT Games popped up at GamesCom Opening Night Live to reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, an all-new block-based collection starring the caped crusader.</p>
<p>This one is set to arrive on Switch 2 at some point in <strong>2026</strong>, and it looks awesome! Legacy of the Dark Knight will adapt some of Batman's most iconic movie moments, featuring the likes of The Joker, Penguin and Bane (voiced by Matt Berry, no less).</p>
<p>We got a glimpse at a sweet-looking combat system, heard about multiple difficulty options, and laughed a little harder than we probably should have done at some dumb LEGO humour.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> absolutely slapped when it launched a few years back, so here's hoping that Mr. Vengeance himself can cook up something similar next year.</p>

<p>It could actually be good, then!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced a brand-new <strong>Bubsy</strong> game – no, really!</p>
<p>In collaboration with developer Fabraz, known for the rather excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> will launch on the Switch and Switch 2. And it actually looks pretty good too! There's no release date at the time of writing, but more information will be coming very soon.</p>
<p>There's even a special outfit available in-game that lets you recreate the old Bubsy games – y'know, if you want. Man, it looks so cool.</p>
<p>Let's check out the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, the Woolies - an aggressive, fabric-stealing alien race from the planet Rayon - are back at it again but this time going straight for the source: stealing Earth's sheep and empowering them with Woolie technology. Things quickly spiral when the sheep revolt, creating a new breed of enemies, the BaaBots, to overthrow their captors and return with a new army to claim back The Golden Fleeces. Now, it’s up to Bubsy and his motley crew of acquaintances to journey through space and steal back the Golden Fleece from the BaaBot’s newly claimed, fleece powered, woolly home planets."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atari is also releasing a collection of Bubsy games in collaboration with Limited Run Games. This will be launching on 9th September 2025, so could well prove to be the best way to prepare for Bubsy 4D.</p>
