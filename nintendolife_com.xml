<p>Titled <strong>'The World of Hideki Kamiya'</strong>, the book is currently only confirmed for release in Japan on <strong>2nd April 2026</strong>, but we'll be keeping a close eye on a potential western release. Naturally, it will cover Kamiya's career, with the creator providing his own thoughts on some of the games he's made over the years.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you can also expect to find over 100 examples of concept art from his games. Heck, even the front cover is an absolute banger, showcasing the likes of Dante from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry">Devil May Cry,</a> Leon and Claire from Resident Evil 2, and Amaterasu from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="53peCvnRDq8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt53peCvnRDq8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938a0tquvni&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Speaking of which, Kamiya is currently hard at work on the official sequel to Okami at his new studio Clovers in collaboration with Capcom. There's no word on when the game might release, but we're very excited to see more.</p>
<p>For now, here's a look at the front cover for The World of Hideki Kamiya:</p>
<figure data-uuid="122017a2ee5fe"><a title="Kamiya Book 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/122017a2ee5fe/kamiya-book-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Kadokawa</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fellow game developer Yoko Taro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/hideki-kamiyas-block-happy-take-no-crappery-is-super-reassuring-says-yoko-taro">recently commented</a> on Kamiya's penchant for blocking users (or "insects", as Kamiya calls them) on social media. He noted that "it’s a net positive to instil that fear that there are some game creators who do have that edge", praising Kamiya for seemingly taking a stand.</p>

<figure data-uuid="becb2cfbc7aae"><a title="Hyrule Warriors / MP4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/becb2cfbc7aae/hyrule-warriors-mp4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf">financial report</a> is in, giving us the official sales numbers for all of its best-selling games as of 31st December 2025. We already highlighted the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/heres-a-look-at-the-best-selling-switch-and-switch-2-games-so-far">best-sellers</a>, in fact, but we couldn't help but notice that both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> — in either its Switch 1 or Switch 2 editions — <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> were missing from the list.</p>
<p>We don't have concrete sales numbers for either of the three releases there (counting Metroid Prime 4's two editions separately), but what we do know is that none of them exceeded one million sales by the time the year was up.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cepqngzy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now, sure, such a cutoff point means that MP4 would have had to exceed the big 'one milly' in under four weeks, which is a <em>slightly</em> tight turnaround, and sales being split between the two console versions was never going to help things — there's every chance that combining the Switch 1 and 2 editions pushes the title past the milestone — but come on. We would have thought that after <em>that much waiting</em>, general hype would boost the numbers a little.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo announced that Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-surpasses-1-million-copies-sold">surpassed one million sales</a> late last month, but it seems that this wasn't the case by the cutoff for Nintendo's figures in December. Again, Switch 2 exclusivity and it <em>not</em> being a new mainline Zelda might have tempered sales a little, but considering that its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">predecessor</a> shifted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/11/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity_is_already_the_best-selling_warriors_game_of_all_time">three million copies in its first week on the market</a>, we imagined this would come out of the gate a little stronger.</p>
<p><em>Update</em><em>: since Koei Tecmo published AOI in Japan, <em>Nintendo will only report the sales outside the region. So, while overseas sales did not exceed one million by Dec 2025, the Japanese numbers pushed it over the mark.</em></em></p>
<p>As we mentioned, we don't have the precise sales numbers for either of these titles just yet, so MP4 may well be closing in on one million already, while Hyrule Warriors reaches for two. Perhaps they'll make an appearance in the next financial update... <em>surely</em>...</p>
<p>You'll find a rundown of all the Switch 2 titles that <em>did</em> surpass one million sales in Q3 in our coverage below.</p>
