<p>To infinity...</p>

<p>After catching our eye at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">The Game Awards</a> last year, we were delighted to see more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a> in today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, particularly with a 'Summer 2026' window attached to it.</p>
<p>In case you missed this one back in December, Orbitals is a co-op-only space adventure from Japanese indie dev Shapefarm and Keplar Interactive. It appears to carry many of the same puzzle platforming head-scratchers as something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, with its split-screen abilities promising plenty of couch conversation — though GameShare was also confirmed today, so feel free to play online too.</p>
<p>Once again, the thing that got us the most excited was the visuals, which look like they have been taken straight out of a classic anime. Protagonists Maki and Omura look particularly delightful, with the new trailer showcasing more of the character-specific abilities and tools they'll be wielding along the way.</p>
<p>Here's a brief written rundown of what's in store, accompanied by some screenshots so you can see what we're so hyped about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team up in this 2-player co-op adventure as Maki and Omura and use your wits to overcome the odds in a retro anime-inspired galaxy. Can you save their home?</p>
<p>Use two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single device for split-screen local co-op, or use the Nintendo Switch 2 GameShare feature to share Orbitals with another local player. Plus, you can also matchmake online with your friends. Players around the world can take advantage of Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat feature to save the day together!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for a more precise release date in the coming months, but for now, we're off to watch that new trailer another 12 times...</p>

<p>Cool Boarders and Ninja Gaiden II launch today</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Hamster has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/rave_racer">Rave Racer</a> will be added to its <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> collection on 26th February 2026. But that's actually not the most interesting announcement.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that a new <strong>Console Archives</strong> initiative is underway for the Switch 2 starting today, with <strong>Cool Boarders</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ninja_gaiden_ii_the_dark_sword_of_chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> launching day one. Other titles joining the line-up at later dates include <strong>Doraemon</strong> and <strong>Sonic Wings Special</strong>.</p>
<p>In short, this is probably the closest we'll get to Virtual Console in 2026, since Nintendo itself has fully embraced the subscription model with Nintendo Switch Online. It's nice to see Hamster introduce an alternative that at least lets us buy the titles outright if we choose.</p>
<p>Seeing Cool Boarders on a Nintendo system is especially jarring and cool, since it's very much associated with PlayStation since its original launch in 1996. Still, we'll take it!</p>

<p>One in a Millennium</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It might have one of the most forgettable titles out there, but Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> is still looking gorgeous. What's more, it has finally picked up a Switch 2 release date.</p>
<p>The HD-2D adventure cropped up in today's Partner Showcase with an <strong>18th June</strong> release date attached — and remember, there's still a free demo on the eShop to check out before then.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcased a little more of the game's story, which sees Elliot and his fairy companion travelling through time to save a cursed princess (is this ringing any bells?). We got a closer look at the four ages Elliot will travel between — The Age of Safekeeping, Reconstruction, Magic and Budding — as well as some pretty slick-looking boss fights.</p>
<p>We had a great time with the demo last year, and we're looking forward to seeing more of this one in a few months' time.</p>

<p>Sweet (roll)</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bethesda closed out today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase with a trio of announcements, but it was the final surprise that really got us excited. Yes, you read that headline correctly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is making its way to Switch 2 at some point this year.</p>
<p>We don't have a precise release date outside of '<strong>2026</strong>' just yet, but hey, it's confirmation!</p>
<p>This one arrived on other systems last year, so we're excited to finally see it come our way. Aside from a visual facelift and some animation tweaks, this remaster treads much closer to 'remake' territory, with almost everything being updated for the modern day.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some Switch 2 screenshots, so you can see what we're talking about:</p>

<p>And yes, the story DLCs — Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles — are included in the release too.</p>
