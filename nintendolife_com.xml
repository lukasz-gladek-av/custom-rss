<p>According to a post on Reddit from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChrisCube64/">ChrisCube64</a>, the reduced input lag has now made the game "actually playable". The original post reported lag of around 14 frames, but a follow-up comment noted that the speed running community timed the input lag at 6 frames. The update has now reportedly reduced this down to around 4 or 5 frames.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0xyphur&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Still not perfect, then, but any improvement is a win. Other users are reporting reduced input lag for other titles on the GameCube app, but it seems the most notable improvement is on The Wind Waker. We've reached out to Nintendo to hopefully obtain official confirmation, and we'll update this article in due course.</p>
<p>The GameCube app now boasts a total of seven playable games, including the aforementioned Wind Waker and Wario World, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II.</a> More are on the way in the future, including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>.</p>

The free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo is now live on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html#Overview">Switch 2 eShop</a>.</p>
<p>We've got a new trailer (above) showcasing what you can expect from this one on Switch 2 and Xbox — though, if you have already played it elsewhere, the cutscene content will be old news.</p>
<p>The free demo will take you through the entirety of the opening Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission, and yes, your save data will carry over to the main game, so there's no need to worry about playing it all through again next year.</p>
<p>Those who play through the demo will be gifted the bonus items “Revival Earrings” and “Survival Set” in the full game when it releases on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, FFVII Remake plays at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-confirms-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-runs-at-a-stable-30fps-on-switch-2">"stable" 30fps</a> on Switch 2, but that hasn't stopped everyone who has played it from having a wonderful time. We loved our time with the port when we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-on-switch-2">hands-on at Gamescom</a> earlier this year, and Digital Foundry previously called it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">"The best-looking thing" on Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>Announcing the 'Woolhaven' expansion</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Every developer is rushing to get their last announcements of 2025 out the door, and with this in mind, the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cult_of_the_lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> has today locked in a date for their new expansion, which will be dropping on Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The Massive Monster family confirmed in a special "mid-winter showcase" that <strong>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven</strong> would be releasing on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>).</p>
<p>This expansion will continue from the main story, and begins when an "unexpected calling from the forgotten God takes you on a perilous new adventure" across a mountain to Woolhaven, the "ancestral home of the Lambs".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yngya, the God of Winter, unleashes frost and snow across the land, making keeping your flock safe, warm, fed and watered the greatest – and most <em>rewarding</em> – challenge faced by The Lamb yet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will come loaded with new dungeons, buildings, weapons, characters, quests and systems. There's also a new "ranching system" – allowing you to tame, ride...and <em>eat</em> majestic beasts. You can find out more in the showcase video below:</p>

<p>For a limited time, you can also pick up the base game of this roguelite for <strong>50% off</strong> its usual price in select regions (bringing it down to <strong>$12.49 / £11.24</strong>). In some other news today, a new expansion has also been announced for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:135857,195359 @ 1765883677 -->
<p>Will you be returning to Cult of the Lamb on the Switch to try out this new expansion? Or do you still need to play through the base game and other content? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

<p>Although this is a soundtrack dating back to the Game Boy era, it's actually packed with 33 tracks (some of those are brief sound bytes, but there's still plenty to listen to). Combined, the album has a total runtime of 24 minutes. It's filled with bangers like Birabuto Kingdom BGM and Muda Kingdom BGM.</p>

<p>Here's the the full tracklist of this 1989/90 Game Boy release:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Birabuto Kingdom BGM</em></li>

<li><em>"HURRY UP!" Tatanga the Mysterious Spaceman</em></li>
<li><em>Princess Daisy Rescued</em></li>
<li><em>Ending</em></li>
</ol>
<p>To listen to this music on the Nintendo Music app, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription. If you want to play this game, it's also available on the 'Nintendo Classics' Game Boy library for Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>This follows Nintendo releasing a "year in review" feature for the Nintendo Music app last week. It allows users to see their most-played tracks, playlist and soundtrack. Nintendo also recently added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yoshis_crafted_world">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> soundtrack to the app as well as a "special" sample of tracks from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>

<h2>Mario Kart World: Ver. 1.4.1 (Released December 15, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player disconnects and reconnects a controller, the game may not progress as normal.
<ul>
<li>When this issue occurs, there are times when ghost data from Time Trials will be deleted without warning from “View Rankings.”</li>

<p>Free update and free upgrade confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Before the talented developer Team Cherry signs off for 2025, it's got <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">some exciting news</a> to share. The "first big" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> expansion is already in the works and is scheduled to arrive in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This new content, officially titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow</a>, will come packed with new areas, bosses, tools and much more. Perhaps, best of all, it's free to all players when it arrives next year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’ll keep further details a secret for now, but expect additional info shortly before <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow</em> releases."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Alongside this, the team has revealed <strong>seven million</strong> people have now purchased Silksong (alongside "millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass").</p>
<figure data-uuid="f453c2162a928"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f453c2162a928/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to the expansion, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> game will also be getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This will incorporate all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the new hybrid platform, including "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions and many additional graphical effects".</p>
<p>If you already own the Switch version of this title, you'll be able to download the Switch 2 release for free when it launches in 2026. In the lead up to this, Team Cherry is also updating the original game for current platforms with added features and bug fixes, and says it's got "even more plans" for next year.</p>
