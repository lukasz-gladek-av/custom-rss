<figure data-uuid="a237be6ccbb44"><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a237be6ccbb44/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gosh, 2026 has been quite the year so far, isn't it? Luckily, we've got games to keep us busy, and we're going to go through which of the buggers we plan on playing this weekend.</p>
<p>In case you've missed the main headlines this week, let's take a peek at what's been going on in the world of Nintendo. First up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-with-another-game">released on the GameCube NSO app</a> for the Switch 2, so that's lovely. Fans of green and purple will also be pleased to know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">new Joy-Con colours</a> are being released in just a few short days.</p>
<p>We got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer-serves-up-a-host-of-fresh-features">new overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which is looking really solid so far, while more 'evidence' emerged to suggest that <strong>Call of Duty</strong> might <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-call-of-dutys-nintendo-release-is-apparently-on-target-for-2026">finally make its way to Nintendo platforms</a> this year.</p>
<p>And now, let's see what Team NL is up to this weekend, hm?</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a more-of-the-same week for me, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/expelled">Expelled</a> still occupying the left side of my Switch 2 home screen. The GameCube NSO app is there now, too, thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Path of Radiance</a> dropping, and I also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a> the other morning with my coffee.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'll be valiantly resisting the eShop sale. Gotta love that post-holidays quarterly tax bill. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I love Star Wars, but it's a franchise I really have to be in the mood for. As such, I often take lengthy breaks before diving back in. The good thing about this is that there's often a boatload of new content to enjoy when I do eventually sidle back into the fandom. With that in mind, I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_jedi_survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, both on the PS5.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is getting a bit of love, though. I'm currently making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and it really is quite remarkable. Ubisoft nailed it with this one; it's just so darn fun with a wonderful sense of place.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't remember the last time that my weekend gaming plans were dominated by free demos, but here we are! I haven’t had a chance to touch either <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>’s tasters yet, and I’m super excited to dive in. I’m not so excited by the prospect of falling madly in love with both of them and ending up with two meaty RPGs on my plate to start the year, but that’s the risky game I play.</p>
<p>Oh yes, I was also lucky enough to finally get Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 over the holidays, so I have been busy tinkering around with all of the side quests I intentionally left untouched once I heard it was coming to the hybrid. May the Force be with you, dear readers!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Being a Portuguese myself it never gets old listening to Portuguese NPCs speaking fluent Portuguese in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Really, they’re a bit everywhere in the game, I hope it all works out for them in the end (historical spoilers: It does not). I am not sure in exactly what percentage of the main story I have already completed, but there will surely be many hours spend this weekend in virtual 16th century Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> left me wanting more trooper based action so after a four year hiatus I have reinstalled <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on STEAM and resumed my single player campaign marathon where I had left it (two thirds into Halo 2). Having just completed (and loved) Halo 3 ODST, I am moving on to Halo 4.</p>
<p>Game of the week is actually a demo: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is just a very cosy JRPG that ticks all my boxes. I hope to compete said demo before the real villain shows up: Monday!</p>

<p>Fans of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> can apparently look forward to "free major updates" this month and next. There are no specific release dates just yet, but here's a rough translation (via RPG Site):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akihiro Hino:</strong> "This is the video published internally in Level-5 on the last working day of 2025. It was done in a rather interesting way, so I'm sharing it with everyone too. Once again, please support us in 2026 as well. Both Inazuma Eleven and Fantasy Life i will have free major updates in January and February. We'll also do an Inadai [stream] on January 13. Look forward to it!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hxlmku&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As you can see above, this news was included alongside a special video featuring Level-5's characters. It follows updates for both Inazuma Eleven and Fantasy Life i at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Apart from these updates, Level-5 is planning to release the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a> game in 2026. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/decapolice">DECAPOLICE</a> is also targeting a release this year.</p>

            <guid>1402279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="db4a5556cf705"><a title="Beast of Reincarnation" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db4a5556cf705/beast-of-reincarnation.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon developer Game Freak recently released the DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, so what's it up to beyond this? In case you missed it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/game-freaks-upcoming-action-rpg-looks-awesome-but-dont-expect-it-on-switch-2-yet">when it was revealed last year</a>, the studio has a new action RPG <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/beast_of_reincarnation"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong></a> in the pipeline.</p>
<p>In an update this week, it's now been revealed we'll be hearing more about it at Xbox's upcoming <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/xbox-developer-direct-2026-showcase-gets-official-date-alongside-three-confirmed-games">Developer Direct showcase</a>, taking place later this month on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. This latest broadcast from Xbox promises to give fans an "inside look at not just the games" but also "the studios working to bring them to life".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>We’ll also be taking a trip to Tokyo to visit the legendary Game Freak, offering a first in-depth look at</em> <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em><em>, which we revealed at Xbox Games Showcase last year."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while there may not necessarily be any Nintendo-related announcements here, we might at least get a look at the inner workings of Game Freak and how it goes about developing new projects.</p>
<p>For now, Beast of Reincarnation will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC and Game Pass. It was officially revealed in June 2025 (just days after the launch of the Switch 2) and is published by Fictions and directed by Kota Furushima - a Game Freak employee who has <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kota_Furushima">worked on the battle system and sound</a> in past Pokémon releases.</p>
<p>Beasts of Reincarnation is described as "an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat". Here's a slightly more detailed description and the trailer from last June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion. Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Game Freak has mostly focused on major Pokémon projects over the years, in between these releases, it has worked on its own unique titles. During the Switch generation, it released games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_town_hero">Little Town Hero</a> across multiple platforms and even revived <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pocket_card_jockey_ride_on">Pocket Card Jockey</a>.</p>
<p>As for its latest Pokémon DLC Mega Dimension, it's not bad, but like the base game it lacks the freedom of the core series.</p>
