<p>Lobbying group includes Nintendo, Sega, and more in its membership</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="Stop Killing Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b73b9a63f9e1/stop-killing-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last couple of weeks or so, an online consumer movement has been doing the rounds that challenges the legality of publishers "destroying" video games sold to customers by revoking access following the cessation of online support. Dubbed <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">'Stop Killing Games'</a>, it consists of petitions to the European Citizens' Initiative and the UK government, with the former surpassing 1.2 million signatures at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Now, the European lobbying group <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/">'Video Games Europe'</a>, which includes Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, Square Enix, and more within its membership, has responded to the movement with a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">statement</a>, making clear that it does not support the 'Stop Killing Games' proposals in the slightest.</p>
<p>Here's what it had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.</p>
<p>"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has also released a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf">more extensive paper</a> providing further detail on its position. It stresses that forcing publishers to maintain online support indefinitely would "have a chilling effect on game design, and act as a disincentive to making such games available in Europe".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The right to decide how, when, and for how long to make an online video game services available to players is vital in justifying this cost and fostering continued technical innovation.</p>
<p>"As rights-holders and economic entities, video games companies must remain free to decide when an online game is no longer commercially viable and to end continued server support for that game. Imposing a legal obligation to continue server support indefinitely, or to develop online video games in a specific technical manner that will allow permanent use, will raise the costs and risks of developing such games.</p>
<p>"It will have a chilling effect on game design, and act as a disincentive to making such games available in Europe. It is far from a trivial modification or a simple addition to the game development phase. It would ignore material reputational, safety, and security concerns."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a complex situation, to be sure, and we should also point out that it's not Nintendo or any of the aforementioned publishers making this statement.</p>
<p>Ross Scott, a YouTuber who started the 'Stop Killing Games' movement, <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1941562023973883972">describes the arguments put forth by Video Games Europe as "flimsy"</a>, and has uploaded a fresh video talking about the topic in more detail.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>In case you missed it, Marvelous and XSEED are bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> to the Switch 2 and Switch next month.</p>
<p>It's already released some trailers and today it's followed this up with a five-minute overview trailer – introducing players to their new life in Zephyr and the bazaar, where they'll use all the services to grow their farm and make the community thrive once again.</p>
<p>In this video, you can also see some of the gameplay in action. This includes the ability to glide about the world, and enjoy many past times from fishing to horse riding. This trailer is only in Japanese right now, but there's more than enough on display to give you an idea of what to expect. If we see an English version of this video released, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This game arrives next month on <strong>27th August 2025</strong> and will be getting a "full physical release" on Switch 2.</p>

<p>As global cumulative sales surpass one million</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/694fa330e1d0f/fantasy-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> got off to a positive start in May, and it seems we've now got an official update from Level-5 – with the company announcing today the "global cumulative sales" for the title have now surpassed 1.2 million units. This figure combines all version sales including Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Along with this, the Japanese company has confirmed a Switch 2 physical version will release on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> in Japan. According to listings on sites like VGP, the Japanese release will be available on the same date locally, supports "multi-language" and the game is apparently "on the cart" ("like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></strong>") with pre-orders now live (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/fantasy-life-i-nintendo-switch-2-physical-edition-photo-mode/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>

<p>Along with this, Level-5 has also announced a Photo Mode will be added to the game including features such as pose settings. There'll also be a contest for this new mode allowing users to showcase their islands, homes, and more. This mode reportedly arrives "later" this month in July.</p>
<p>The additional free DLC '<strong>Update the World</strong>' is also planned and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-free-dlc-will-steal-more-time-in-huge-roguelike-open-world-mode">will transform the Fantasy Life i</a> into a roguelike, open world adventure. If you haven't already bought the game, on the Switch 2, there's also a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-gets-switch-2-release-date-with-paid-upgrade-path-for-switch-1-players">paid upgrade path for a small sum</a>.</p>
