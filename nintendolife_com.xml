<p>Jeff Minter is, perhaps quite rightly, referred to as a legend within the gaming industry. His career following the founding of Llamasoft in 1982 has spawned dozens of the most unique and recognisable titles in existence, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tempest_4000">Tempest 4000</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/akka_arrh">Akka Arrh</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/polybius">Polybius</a>, <strong>Attack of the Mutant Camels</strong>, and <strong>Gridrunner</strong>.</p>
<p>Those unfamiliar with Minter should check out Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/llamasoft_the_jeff_minter_story">Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a>, a phenomenal interactive documentary looking at the creator's career with dozens of playable games from the Llamasoft back catalogue.</p>
<p>Now, however, alongside partner and co-developer Ivan 'Giles' Zorzin, Minter is about to unleash another stylised remake in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot</a>, based on the original 1984 arcade curio from Atari and creator Dave Theurer (who, by the way, also created the original arcade <strong>Tempest</strong>, a game which shaped Minter's career).</p>
<p>Following on from the critical success of both Tempest 4000 and Akka Arrh on Switch, I, Robot revamps the original's maze-like gameplay in which you avoid the gazing eye of 'Big Brother', shoot down 'Tetras' in space, and create bizarre painterly masterpieces with the 'Ungame' mode – all the while injecting some of that instantly-recognisable Llamasoft iconography.</p>
<p>We recently sat down with Minter (and Giles, albeit briefly) to find out more about the game, Llamasoft's partnership with Atari, and Jeff's thoughts on the upcoming Switch 2.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Can you talk about how I, Robot came to be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff Minter, Llamasoft founder:</strong> Well, I'd look through Atari's back catalogue for games to update and I like going for the more obscure things. The big titles are often spoken for anyway, and if you go for something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/asteroids">Asteroids</a> or <strong>Centipede</strong>, people tend to have pretty big opinions on how it should be, so you have a bit less creative freedom.</p>
<p>The more obscure games tend to have very interesting ideas that perhaps didn't get the kind of exposure that they deserved back in the day. I quite like the idea of taking these things, blowing the dust off, and perhaps giving them a bit more publicity in modern times. I, Robot is a particular favourite of mine, I played it back in the day a fair bit; a friend of mine actually owned the coin-op machine, so I was able to go to his house and play it extensively.</p>
<p>The technology was groundbreaking at the time, and so it definitely stuck in my mind. One thing I loved about it was that because the graphics technology was so new, they built a special mode into the game where you just played with the 3D graphics. That was at a time when I started doing my own early light synth work, so there was the idea of playing a game that wasn't quite a game, but still interesting. I've actually implemented something similar into my own version; it's called 'The Ungame', so you can go ahead and play around with the parameters of the lights.</p>

<p><strong>So in what ways has Llamasoft's I, Robot been updated from the original?</strong></p>
<p>There's a chunk of Llamasoft in there, there's no doubt about that. But you also have to make the basic translation from an arcade environment to a home environment; arcade games are built to kick you off within three minutes and get more money in. So you have to adjust it to allow players to sit down and enjoy it a bit longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope I've kept enough of the original that fans enjoy it, but also there's enough Llamasoft in there that people who like Llamasoft will enjoy it too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is the same. There's this eye looking at you and you can't jump while it's open. I've extended that from the original a bit, so now the eye can fire at you while it's open along with some other stuff. I've sped things up a little so it's not quite as slow anymore. Every few levels you get something called the Arena Mode, and this essentially sees you being attacked from all sides, but you have extended firepower with which to shoot back.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I've kept the spirit of the original and I hope people like it. I hope I've kept enough of the original that fans enjoy it, but also there's enough Llamasoft in there that people who like Llamasoft will enjoy it too.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any challenges with the development of I, Robot that you perhaps haven't experienced before?</strong></p>
<p>Well, to me, it's always a bit of a step into the unknown when I'm doing a new game. So I don't sit down and design everything first, I kind of just make it up as I go. Sometimes it can take a while for a game to find its groove; you can be fiddling about, you've got some structure there, but it's not quite working.</p>
<p>So it can be a bit of an anxious time because you think, 'I'm never going to make this fit.' I've been in that situation loads of times over my career and eventually you get to trust your instinct that everything will come together. The same thing happened with Akka Arrh, it actually took quite a while for me to find the correct feeling for that one.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, it's not a particularly demanding game, so there's little challenge in that sense. It runs very well on the Switch and it runs very well on the Atari VCS. <em>[Note: Not the original VCS, we hasten to clarify; Atari released a Linux-based console in 2021 that <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/atari-wouldnt-have-launched-its-2021-vcs-in-2024">unfortunately didn't quite take off</a>, but still hosts the majority of Atari's first-party offerings.]</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="0f58f3821996a"><a title="Jeff Minter - I, Robot 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f58f3821996a/jeff-minter-i-robot-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atari</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How have you found development on the Nintendo Switch specifically?</strong></p>
<p>Giles, come here! <strong><em><br></em></strong></p>
<p>[Giles joins the interview.]</p>
<p><strong>Giles:</strong> Doing the graphics, doing the sound, everything works absolutely fine, no problem. Nintendo has good documentation, and really the only complaint is that there are so many different portals for different things, it can get a bit fragmented.</p>
<p>The biggest pain in the ass is making all the stuff conform, all the UI, little things have to be right, and it can take a long time to test certain things, sometimes hours at a time. But no, the machine is nice, it works very nice, the game runs at 60fps.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that you like going for the more obscure titles; do you get any pushback from the folks at Atari, or do they just let you crack on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> By and large, they just let me do my own thing. Early in development, they'll give me a bit of feedback, and usually I'll say, "It's too early for feedback, everything can change!"</p>
<p>But generally, they're very good about it, and it's one of the reasons I like working with them. They give me complete creative freedom to do whatever I want, and having now done it a couple of times, they trust me enough to just get on with it and something good will come in the end.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-llamasofts-jeff-minter-discusses-his-new-game-akka-arrh-and-working-with-atari">You've mentioned in the past</a> that working with Atari affords you that vital creative freedom, but also brings some financial stability. With this in mind, can we expect this partnership to continue going forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Oh yeah absolutely, I'm extremely happy with it. I can just sit down and concentrate on the things that I do well and not worry about the things I don't do so well. Stuff like marketing I'm absolutely terrible at. I'm happy to offload that onto them, and they do a nice job of it; they do wonderful trailers which I could never do.</p>
<p>As you say, there's a bit of financial stability to it, which is always welcome. So yeah, we're definitely not stopping yet.</p>

<p><strong>I would like to ask if there's anything else from Atari's back catalogue that you've got your eye on, but I suspect you're probably not going to tell me!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> All I'll say is that we had a meeting to discuss potentially what I might do next. Before the meeting, I went through the IP catalogue and there were two titles which stood out to me. So one of the Atari guys at the meeting said, "We've been thinking about what you might be interested in doing and what might suit you," and it turns out that the two games at the top of their list were the same two titles that I picked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm very lucky to have this opportunity to work on exactly the kind of things I like to work on, because there's a great deal of stability, and I'm seizing onto that with both hands and going to keep it up as long as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>That's wild! So if I look into the back catalogue, I might be able to guess..?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well if you're thinking the same way that they're thinking, then maybe you could guess them!</p>
<p><strong>I'm not going to do that now, I don't want to embarrass myself <em>[though for the record, we've got Black Widow in our minds...!]</em> On the flip side, are there any games that are an absolute no-go for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, there's always room to do something, I think, but you've got to respect the original. Sometimes you can go a bit too far and do something completely different. I wouldn't put anything off the table, but I've got to be into the idea of whatever it is that I'm going to do, y'know? I don't think I'd be happy if they just handed me something and said, "Do that!"</p>
<p><strong>Doing things your own way has always been a Llamasoft staple, and it seems to be quite a rare thing in the current climate. I wonder if you can comment on the state of the industry at large at the moment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, it's obviously a very difficult time for the industry at the moment. I'm very lucky to have this opportunity to work on exactly the kind of things I like to work on, because there's a great deal of stability, and I'm seizing onto that with both hands and going to keep it up as long as possible.</p>
<p>It's very hard for indies to get known these days. It seems a lot of the times it's more about how good you are at publicity than how good you are a making a game, so a lot of creators are having a tough time. I wake up every day and I count my blessings. I'm very lucky to be able to do this.</p>
<p><strong>It seems especially difficult to stand out amongst the crowd at the moment given how many titles release on digital storefronts all the time. We've particularly highlighted an issue with so-called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-rise-of-scam-games-and-keyword-bingo-firms-flooding-switch-eshop">'scam games'</a> over the last few years...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong><strong>:</strong> Oh yeah, someone told me about something called 'Jumping Hot Dog' or something where you just press a button and get achievements. I don't understand how those things are even allowed to go onto the stores, it's just clogging things up for everybody else.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4ff7a42511f9b"><a title="Jeff Minter - I, Robot 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4ff7a42511f9b/jeff-minter-i-robot-10.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atari</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How does it feel to see this kind of stuff when you're trying to put your own game out there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> It's a perversion of the whole thing. To me, making games is about making something which I think is good and that I hope other people enjoy and will think is good value for money. There's pride in it for me. I don't think I could be proud of something that may well make more money than I could do normally, but there's no art, no communication, no substance to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm old school. I was lucky enough to be there at the start of the games business when you really could just do everything out of passion, and everything grew up around that. Now it seems quite a lot of game design and publishing is more about making money than it is about making art. It should be more about art than money, really.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Perhaps both you and Giles can chip in with this, but what are your thoughts on the Switch 2 from what we've seen so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I'm very much looking forward to it, it looks like it'll be a nice thing.</p>
<p><strong>Giles:</strong> We've been trying and trying to get a dev kit but sadly nothing at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah I think we're probably fairly low down on the priority list! But we'll definitely be keen to work on it when we get our hands on it, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Giles:</strong> I will say that it's always good to work on the lower side of things, because if you can make it good there, then you can always make it even better on more powerful hardware.</p>

<p>One of those people is legendary game designer Hideki Kamiya, who has been speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20251219044/index_3.html#clo_kam">4Gamer</a> about his gaming impressions of 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/2004712820403999129?s=46&amp;t=_ZthC0M-yfLcPVPyf_xLfQ">Stealth</a>).</p>
<p>Kamiya spoke about picking up a Switch 2 this year before discussing the fact that it lacks a traditional D-Pad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For some reason, in this age of diversity, the manufacturer itself has stubbornly refused to offer the option of a "Joy-Con with a D-pad" since the Switch 1. This just didn't fit into my gaming lifestyle, where I usually play while lying down, so I have no choice but to use the Joy-Con when playing games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry">Devil May Cry</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/wonderful_101">Wonderful 101</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> reveals that he actually reverted back to the original Switch as a result, because he could use peripherals which add a proper D-Pad (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/08/hardware_review_hori_d-pad_joy-con_controller_for_nintendo_switch">like Hori's special Joy-Con</a>, we assume):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Somehow I was able to get by. I was able to continue my daily routine of "one Tetris 99 a day," but even so, as someone who continues to post shady things on social media every day in the shadows at the very edge of the games industry, I decided that I should gradually make the Switch 2 my regular hardware, and as I was writing this, I purchased a new Cyber ​​Gadget "mini grip with D-pad," which I use with the Switch 1, and after some sanding and modifying it so that it could be attached to the Switch 2, where the button layout is slightly different, I was able to make my own "D-pad Joy-Con 2," which finally allowed me to play titles from "Arcade Archives 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Were you hoping to see some more variety in the Joy-Con 2 options by now? Or do you prefer using the analogue stick? Let us know with a comment.</p>

<p>I'm still nursing a Linda McCartney-induced food coma after a week of glad tidings, so whatever I play this weekend, it’ll have to be something that keeps me very much curled up in my seat. There are another few areas of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> to see and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a> is calling my name.

<p>2025 was THE year of gaming for yours truly. I am quite looking forward to seeing what 2026 throws my way, but I am dreading the price of a hypothetical gaming PC upgrade… at least Switch 2 seems to continue to climb the industry ladder, can’t wait to see what new surprises Nintendo throws our way.

<p>I don't think I'll be getting any games for Christmas, but I have bought my partner the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a>, in the hopes that he'll want to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a> (which he's mentioned before!). I've never played a Final Fantasy game except half of the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7</a>, which feels like it doesn't really count in a lot of ways. I hear FF6 is good! Don't tell me anything about it, though — I've somehow managed to avoid any FF spoilers for my entire life, and I'd like to keep it that way!</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to play through some of my Steam Deck backlog over the break, which includes a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/regency_solitaire">Regency Solitaire</a> that my friend got me, and <strong>Séance of Blake Manor</strong>. I'm looking forward to both.</p>
<p>Aaaand, if there's any time between all that, I'm going to try to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, and force my partner to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000XResist</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/13_sentinels_aegis_rim">13 Sentinels</a>. I think that's a reasonable amount of video games to fit into 2 weeks, right? Yeah. Totally reasonable.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> a couple of days ago and immediately hit Bandcamp to download the Blood Cultures soundtrack. And then immediately went back to Bandcamp, slightly grumpier, to download another Blood Cultures album that has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiA41zgrj_Y">the first song you hear in the game</a>. I've only played 20 minutes but I'm loving it so far.<br>
I really need to download <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2D</a> over Christmas, too - I am the ultimate target audience for that thing and I want to savour it. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is an end-of-year arrival (one that Felix put on his top five games of the gear, no less!) that I'm eager to sit down with.</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My wife and I have a bit of a tradition when it comes to the time after Christmas but before New Year: we hibernate. We'll pick a game, usually something fairly meaty like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>, and just go to town on it for a few days straight.</p>
<p>We'll break for dinner (plenty of leftovers), go for walks in the woods, and other stuff besides, but there could well be a 24-hour period where we do not leave the house or do anything of note beyond playing our chosen game. What'll it be this year? Let's just say that we've fallen dramatically behind on our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> recently.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't plan on playing much over the last remaining days of 2025, but I have recently started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a> again, so I'd like to dip into that one occasionally if I can find the time. It's a weirdly relaxing game despite some of the deviously tricky stages, y'know?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I think we'll be welcoming the New Year in with a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which I made the mistake of leaving Zach alone with for one morning and now we have all of the Battle-Tested and Forbidden Weapons, and have had them since level 50. So yeah, any sense of challenge in the main game has evaporated! What can you do about RPG fans, hey?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll be checking out the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> update and playing a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>. Nothing crazy, it's the holiday season, and we have a big 2026 ahead of us. See you next year!</p>

<p>Fans of the long-running RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> have a chance to tell Square Enix their thoughts about the series in a new online survey. It’s available until 9th January 2026 and features over 30 questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no reward at the end of it, so if you do plan on doing this survey, it's mostly to tell Square Enix how you feel. Of course, it will also narrow down who you are with the usual questions like your age and how many games you've purchased recently.</p>
<p>From there, you're asked things like whether you've bought physical or digital copies of Final Fantasy, your familiarity with the series, how many games in the series you've purchased, what game you like the most, and even how high your expectations are for the series "in the future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="KK3nTYgZ9yY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKK3nTYgZ9yY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6205b9yhvzru&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Towards the end of the survey, you're also able to provide feedback about the Final Fantasy series with a written response.</p>

<p>This follows on from the recent release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo. If you haven’t already played this, It comes with a gifted bonus for the full game. This includes some “Revival Earrings” and the “Survival Set”. Your save data will also carry over to the main game when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> fan and happen to be located in the United States or Canada, Nintendo is currently running a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> ‘Legacy Sweepstakes’ featuring a “bounty” of prizes.</p>
<p>You can enter this sweepstakes via the My Nintendo website for <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong>. This gives you a chance to win the official Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective art book as well as a highly-detailed Samus Gravity Suit PVC statue from First 4 Figures.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit about both, along with a look:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f45e29e93c4d0"><a title="Metroid Prime" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f45e29e93c4d0/metroid-prime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, this art book showcases concept drawings, sketches, and assorted illustrations from the Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, and Metroid Prime Remastered games. With an extensive range of behind-the-scenes, high-quality artwork, this hardcover anthology spans more than 20 years of game development and includes exclusive commentary from Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe and Retro Studios. Printed on premium sheet-fed art paper, this book is stitch-bound, with a lavish cloth hardcover featuring an etched Samus metallic foil.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>First 4 Figures proudly presents a PVC statue of Samus Aran in her Gravity Suit inspired by the Metroid Prime game! Standing 10 inches tall and 7.9 inches wide, this deluxe statue faithfully recreates the sleek design and iconic components of the Gravity Suit. The base upon which Samus stands is inspired by the Screw Attack emblem. Plus, the Exclusive Edition incorporates an LED light-up function that brings Samus to life. When activated, key elements of the suit glow, including the helmet, Arm Cannon, and blue piping along the arms and legs!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official art book is valued at $49.99 USD and the statue is valued at $164.99 USD. This sweepstakes ends on <strong>3rd February 2026</strong>, and there will be five winners in total that receive both items.

This includes the talented Japanese developer Monolith Soft, best-known during the Switch generation for its work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series.</p>
<p>Now that another year has passed, the company has taken a brief moment on social media to acknowledge the release of the two titles it worked on this year. This obviously includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Here's the translated message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’ll also be plenty of hard work next year on even more projects! Here’s the translated message in full:</p>
<p>“Monolith Soft's last day of work for the year is today.</p>
<p>This year saw the release of two titles: “Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition” and “Mario Kart World,” on which we worked as a subcontractor.</p>
<p>All our staff will continue to work hard next year as well. We look forward to your continued support.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition arrived earlier this year in March. Since then, this version has received some compatibility updates for the Switch 2. As for the new Mario Kart, as we previously highlighted, Monolith Soft was contracted to develop "fields and character designs".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer celebrated the 8th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> with some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/anniversary-monolith-soft-celebrates-xenoblade-chronicles-2-with-a-post-but-were-desperate-for-a-switch-2-revamp">stunning artwork</a>.

<p>However, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">with a Metacritic rating of 79 at the time of writing</a>, it's clear that Samus' latest adventure didn't strike the same chord with many players.</p>
<p>It's certainly a different experience from prior Metroid outings, and it seems that Nintendo is willing to chalk this down to its protracted development period – lest we forget, it was originally announced in 2017 with Bandai Namco assisting, but was rebooted in 2019 with Retro Studios returning to the helm.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/" rel="noopener">Famitsu</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson (a name isn't given, it's worth noting) gives the following assessment of Metroid Prime 4's development period (thanks to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-discusses-its-approach-to-metroid-prime-4-and-why-it-isnt-open-world/">Nintendo Everything</a> for the translation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world Metroid’. However, Metroid’s core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas. Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.</p>
<p>In the end, the game took much longer than expected to finish, and we realized that players’ impressions toward open-world games had changed. That being said, development had already been reset once before (when we started again from scratch with Retro Studios) so backtracking development again was out of the question, and we resolved to move forward with our original vision. During this time, shooting games and action games went through evolutions, with an increase in game speed in particular, but taking in those changes would have made it difficult to construct the tempo of an adventure game, so we actively chose to not take them into account. Therefore, I think this game is pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as we (and many other outlets) loved Metroid Prime 4, it's fair to say that Retro Studios wouldn't have chosen to inherit a design template it had little influence or control over, and this surprisingly candid interview appears to back up this assumption.</p>
