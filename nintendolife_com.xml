<figure><a title="Nintendo Life Mailbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ba10aeceb4b25/nintendo-life-mailbox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>And here we are again, entering the last third of the year, kicking furiously to keep our head above the water as the deluge of big new video games washes in. What's that floating like a flotsam-y life raft on the surface? Why, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>. Grab on!</p>
<p>Yes, it's time for our monthly letters page feature. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Not a huge selection this month - presumably you've all been busy playing the video games. So, let's dry these few missives in the sun and get reading, shall we?</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - September 2025</h2>
<h3>"frightfully confusing" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo variable pricing for Switch 1 and 2 games is becoming a frightfully confusing situation. Let's run down some costs here first of all for physical games:</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 (switch 2 version): £58.99 RRP<br>
Metroid Prime 4 (switch 1 version): £49.99 RRP<br>
Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Switch 2): £66.99 RRP<br>
Mario Galaxy 1+2 (Switch 1): £58.99 RRP</p>
<p>So... How on earth is the SWITCH 2 version of Metroid Prime 4, a game that took 8 years of development and is clearly one of Nintendo's most expensive projects, the same price as ports of two old Wii Mario games for Switch 1?</p>
<p>I have actually managed via a third party seller to acquire a Metroid Prime 4, Switch 2 version pre-order for £48.85. That is insane value, and yet Nintendo are charging through the roof for what can only be objectively described as a less significant gaming experience.</p>
<p>When Bill Trinnen said variable pricing was based on the overall experience and value proposition, I'm sorry but, absolute porkies Bill. This situation belies any logic and I cannot get my head around it. Please understand? How Bill, How!?<br>
<strong><em>YoshiTails</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting aside the fact that nobody knows yet if Prime 4 is "insane value" at that price, Nintendo charges what they think people will pay, end of. Bill's being a bit vague, but he's not telling porkies. Nintendo looks at the Galaxy bundle and sees not a pair of polished-up ports pushed out on an ageing console, but two 10/10 all-timers (and they've got the review scores to prove it) brought together in a convenient package. An "objectively...less significant gaming experience" it is not.</p>
<p>The price tag stings for you and me — people who paid and played these games years ago — but millions of people <em>will</em> pay £58.99 and be over the moon with them. And the rest of us? Maybe we’ll pick up Galaxy 2 down the road.</p>
<p>As for Metroid, the series is growing, but it's not in Mario's league sales-wise. If they want to sell decent numbers (to people beyond Metroid devotees who would pay $90 if they <em>had</em> to), 60 quid is a reasonable ask - the value-proposition sweet spot for that game, by Nintendo's judgement.</p>
<p>And Nintendo would never (publicly) use dev and the associated costs to justify higher price points because it would bite them in the ass when ‘Mario Party Boogaloo’ arrives in 12 months' time and everyone starts complaining it isn't $40. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"I want to vet"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the big problems with Shovelware is it makes new game discovery almost impossible. Back in the DSi games, I would occasionally download random games that just sounded kind of fun and discovered a lot of real gems this way. Today, I find myself scrolling through the weekly Nintendo Download section you fine people provide and I sometimes see a title that looks like it might be fun, but I'm afraid to get burned by some false-advertising shovelware game. This means that there are probably some real indie gems out there that are getting overlooked.</p>
<p>My question: Since Nintendo doesn't seem to be in a rush to fix this issue, what steps should I take when I want to vet a new, fun-sounding game to see if it's legit? What are the tells that you're going to get a piece of shovelware garbage?<br>
<strong>Pak-Man</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We covered how to avoid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-rise-of-scam-games-and-keyword-bingo-firms-flooding-switch-eshop">'keyword bingo' and 'scam' games</a> a while ago, so check out that article if you missed it. Generally, though, those are fairly easy to spot - and that goes for the AI-slop and rubbish that outfits like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Aaldora">Aldora</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Apakotime">Pakotime</a> pump out weekly.</p>
<p>I get the sense you mean games which might look like a Downwell or a VVVVVV or a [insert brilliant pixel-art game here] from the outside but turn out to be low-effort rubbish? Most games that look like Vampire Survivors are <em>not</em> Vampire Survivors! I understand the predicament.</p>
<p>It's still quite rare, though, to find a good game with literally zero positivity <em>somewhere</em> on the internet. If you've run out of bona fide classics in your backlog and want to get adventurous or catch up on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/reader-recommendations">gems you missed</a>, I'd make sure to find a clip of the game running at least. Seeing it in motion will filter out plenty.</p>
<p>And the rest? That uncertainty is part of the thrill, I suppose! I don't remember the last time I bought a game on a whim without knowing exactly what it was. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"nerf yourself"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendo Life,</p>
<p>A big part of the Donkey Kong series is the amazing boss battles, so I was disappointed with the lack of difficulty in Donkey Kong Bananza. I know that a counterargument is that if you want more difficulty, you should use less hearts and recovery items, but I don’t find it fun to “nerf” yourself. That’s like saying “If you think Super Mario Bros. is too easy, you should play it blindfolded.” In his YouTube channel, Sakurai discussed the importance of “risk and reward,” so not only should games have options for difficulty, but games should encourage players to go for the highest difficulty that they can handle. I feel that a good example of this in a platformer is Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair—not only did that game have customizable difficulty, but it had an in-game reward system that encouraged you to go for higher difficulty. I just find it sad that more and more games are giving out rewards with no risk. Back in my day, games weren’t afraid to challenge you. And, by gum, we liked it!<br>
Oh dear. I’ve become Cranky Kong.<br>
<strong>-Anonymous</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know, I hit a wall with the final boss and still haven't been back because I got distracted by banandium when I went back to the higher levels.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty discourse around Silksong wound me up (though not quite as much as 'Silksong's too cheap!'), although I get it — who's got the time we had back in the day to spend a whole summer beating one incredibly difficult game? I also get not wanting to self-nerf.</p>
<p>More intelligently implemented options around difficulty are a good thing in my book. Nintendo often errs on the cautious side with its trad-style, three-hit-kill Mario and Zelda bosses, but I don't come to those games looking for friction or mountain to summit. <em>Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"the same guy"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello hello! It's the same guy who went on a tirade last month about Blaster Master Zero being underrated! (I hope I got a few new believers).</p>
<p>I did end up giving Just Shaped and Beats a whirl per your recommendations and you know what? I'm a fan. What you see is what you get, it's no nonsense, the beats are beautiful, it's addicting, and there are two connections to Mega Man. Sort of.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>A track by Bossfight features in the game. Bossfight also did a stellar remix of Wily Stage 1 from Mega Man 2 (even a live performance!). And the track Yokuman Stage? Lifted straight from the fangame Mega Man Unlimited.</p>
<p>That's enough rambling from me though, have a great day/night.</p>
<p>P.S. Silksong coming out is challenging Shinobi: Art of Vengeance as my Game of the Year and it hurts the Sega child in me.<br>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-operation-c-probotector-game-boy">Last time</a>, it was the Game Boy's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/operation_c">Operation C</a> (or <strong>Probotector</strong>, depending on your region) being put in the limelight, and we had a full three covers to choose between. It was the North American design that walked away with the win, however, snatching up 56% of the vote and splitting the remaining 23% and 21% between Japan and Europe, respectively.</p>
<p>With another Yoshi game on the horizon (don't tell us you had forgotten about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">The Mysterious Book</a> already!), we thought it only right to head back to Mario's dino pal this week, as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshi_touch_and_go">Yoshi Touch &amp; Go</a> on the DS. It's not the greatest Yoshi game by any means, but we remember having some fun with it back in the mid-2000s.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fguzhsm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA87rC9nG4k" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Europe and North America opted for the same design on this one, so we've got a good old-fashioned duel on our hands. Crack out of your shell and let's get into it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:144307 @ 1758463331 -->
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b3b55b296f33/yoshi-touch-and-go-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bright, colourful and just a little bit sweet, we've got a soft spot for the European design. Yoshi and Baby Mario take centre stage as a Shy Guy propels by in the top corner, and the small stylus icon tells you everything you need to know about the game's controls. Neat!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34a49b5f518ff/yoshi-touch-and-go-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design goes for something very different indeed. It's far more stripped back than its counterparts, and puts the focus on a little bit of peril. Baby Mario is a bigger focal point of this one (you can't knock a bit of brand recognition), and we see the stylus iconography make a return in the crayon line background.</p>

<p>As part of the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-everything-announced-for-super-marios-40th-anniversary">40th anniversary news</a>, Nintendo revealed it would be offering a "limited-time" Nintendo Museum ticket.</p>
<p>Instead of the regular Mii design, for the next year (between now and September 2026), Nintendo Museum guests will be able to get a special Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary design. Again, this will be available for "approximately one year". Here it is:</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce860db020de8/nintendo-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's official Museum webpage explains how all tickets will be this Mario anniversary design by default during this period. If you've already set your ticket to the Mii design, there's no need to worry, as you can swap it via the official Nintendo Museum ticketing website before visiting.</p>
<p>Nintendo's website also mentions how the specific "end date for the special Mario design will be announced at a later date".</p>
<p>Nintendo is expanding on these celebrations at its museum as well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-museum-introduces-limited-time-mario-bros-40th-anniversary-ticket">with not only its art gallery</a> (featuring art from Mario's games), but also a "limited-time" lighting display, which will begin in December 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nintendo Museum will be illuminated with special lighting throughout the facility from Wednesday, December 3, 2025, to Monday, April 27, 2026. During this period, the special lighting will be active from 4:00 PM until closing. At the Warp Pipe photo spot, a special installation featuring the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary logo will be on display. Visitors can take photos with it throughout the day.</p>

<p>Team Reptile has announced it will be releasing another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/jet_grind_radio">Jet Set</a>-style release. Following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bomb_rush_cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> on the Switch in 2023, it has now unveiled its new project <strong>Hyperfunk</strong>.</p>
<p>The exact name and details are "subject to change". It's targeting a PC and console launch, but specific platforms and the release date haven't been confirmed just yet. Here's the official summary, and above you can check out the teaser trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team Reptile’s new game is called HYPERFUNK. An extreme trick and graffiti game in which the higher your combo score, the faster you can boost. Follow the story of a crew called MACH10 and compete with the other crews in dynamic style wars or hang out online with friends.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183480/HYPERFUNK/">Steam listing</a> also notes how you'll be able to "meet random online players" and "hang out online with your friends".</p>

<p>The recent Direct broadcast revealed the Virtual Boy library would be joining the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library.</p>
<p>As you've likely already seen, there are a few paywalls. Firstly, you'll need to have an active Expansion Pack subscription (on top of the regular Switch Online subscription), and according to Nintendo, a paid accessory is "required".</p>
<p>There are two options here - the Virtual Boy replica for <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong> or the more affordable cardboard model for <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187794 @ 1758464256 -->
<p>With all of this in mind, it's got us wondering if you're planning to check out this new digital collection when it arrives for Switch and Switch 2 on 17th February 2026. <em>So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39bc17e5e3c50/resident-evil-requiem-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since the first big blowout Direct for the Switch 2 back in April, I’ve been itching to see an announcement for <strong>Resident Evil</strong> on the new console. It’s possibly my favourite series of all time, after all, so I’m eager to play the recent entries on a Nintendo console without having to connect to the bloomin’ Cloud. Heck, aren’t we all?</p>
<p>I’ve been banging on about it so much over online chats and meetings that I’m quite sure my colleagues were just about sick of it weeks ago. So you can imagine how much my excitement ramped up when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-resident-evil-requiem-could-be-heading-to-the-switch-2">rumours began to surface</a> about not only existing RE Engine games making their way to Switch 2, but also the upcoming ninth mainline entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>Surely not, right? We’re Nintendo fans, for goodness’ sake; we’re used to getting ports of games months, if not years after their release on other platforms. That’s if they even get ported <em>at all</em>, of course. Which often isn’t the case. And that’s fine, y’know, we’ve got our own first-party games to enjoy, plus a plethora of incredible indie titles.</p>

<p>But then it happened. Towards at the end of the latest Nintendo Direct, atmospheric shots of spooky hallways emerged, followed by the ringing of a telephone. 'Is this Resident Evil?!' I asked myself. And, stone the crows, it <em>was</em>! Not just any Resident Evil either, but as rumoured, it was Resident Evil Requiem, launching day-and-date with other consoles on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This, in my opinion, represents a pretty significant shift for the Switch 2 early in its lifespan. As I said, we’re so used to getting ports of games long after their initial release on other platforms (or, in the case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, just a few weeks later), but this is a major new entry in one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time – a franchise in which 4 of the 13 titles available on Switch were relegated to Cloud Versions. Yet there it was; a native port launching right alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>There was once a time – very briefly, mind you – in which Capcom and Nintendo were besties, with the former bringing a bunch of exclusives to the GameCube, including the now-iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Thanks to lukewarm sales, it didn't last long, and with Nintendo subsequently going in a drastically different direction to Sony and Microsoft, flagship RE games just weren't a thing on Nintendo consoles anymore.</p>
<p>The success of the Switch did change things quite a bit, and Capcom has done an admirable job in supporting the system over the years, but from the customer's point of view, and from <em>our</em> point of view, Cloud Versions just aren't good enough, and it felt like Switch owners were still drawing the short straw. Now, we're back in the driver's seat, and it feels wonderful.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting some major revolution in which every publisher suddenly rushes to launch their flagship games on the Switch 2, but the console’s remarkable success since its launch just a handful of months back has clearly made executives sit up and pay attention. This, along with the Switch 2's favourably comparable specs to the Series S has made immediate ports of new games a much more likely prospect.</p>

<p>Now, you could make the argument that Resident Evil Requiem isn’t the first ‘AAA’ game to launch day-and-date with other platforms. We had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> back in July, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> earlier this month, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> is launching just next week. But let’s be fair, publishers would still be releasing sports games on the PS2 if they thought they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Seeing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> gave me a great deal of hope that the Switch 2 would be a good home for modern blockbusters, even if it means waiting just that little bit longer. Then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> happened, and that felt like a good nudge in the right direction.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, though? Yeah, that’s on a whole new level. This is a big deal, and I sincerely hope it signifies a bit more openness from publishers to launch their games on the Switch 2 alongside other platforms.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that we're getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> in March 2026 alongside other platforms, and there's a good chance <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">the untitled third entry in the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">trilogy</a></strong> will also land day-and-date. Good things are happening folks!</p>
<p>Whether it continues is likely down to how well these games actually sell, so... Yeah, buy Resident Evil Requiem, everyone.</p>
