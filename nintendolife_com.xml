<figure><a title="Splatoon 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7bae9f7be2982/splatoon-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has gone to the extent of providing a series of free upgrades for select Switch titles on the Switch 2, and it's even rolled out updates for other first-party games, but it seems one other title might need a look.</p>
<p>According to reports, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> community has discovered a new bug in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> on Switch 2 – allowing squid kids to "squid roll" on "any surface, regardless of if it is inked in your colour". This was originally shared by a user known as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/diolass.bsky.social/post/3lqyctc7ylk2e">'Diolass' on Bluesky</a>, who described it as "game-breaking" on the competitive front.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12erthsij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>While it's not clear why exactly this is happening, dataminer 'OatmealDome' speculates it "might be an issue with Switch 1 GPU emulation/translation since Splatoon games have had issues with ink detection in unofficial emulators due to bugs in their GPU emulation".</p>
<p>Switch 2 backward compatibility obviously still has some issues, with Nintendo officially releasing a list of games with issues and titles in the process of being fixed. Even some apps like YouTube aren't available at launch.</p>
<p>If we hear about any updates or patches for Splatoon 3 on the Switch 2, we'll let you know. How are you finding this series on Nintendo's new system so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>A new project from G-Mode and Red Art Games</p>

<figure><a title="Joe &amp; Mac Retro Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33f3aa4d05205/joe-and-mac-retro-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Red Art Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Retro game collections are all the rage nowadays and following in the footsteps of classic mascots like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy</a> are now Joe and Mac.</p>
<p>This new package, officially titled <strong>Joe &amp; Mac Retro Collection</strong>, is slightly different as it's a Kickstarter project scheduled to go live on <strong>10th June</strong> (aka next week) and is expected to release later this year digitally on multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Play as three cavemen fighting dinosaurs in this retro collection of three SNES/Super Famicom titles, coming to Steam/PS5/Xbox/Switch!"</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="1cjcr-XtVQw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cjcr-XtVQw"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cjcr-XtVQw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It will contain the following three 16-bit Super Nintendo releases from Data East:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> (<em>ジョーとマック 戦え原始人</em>) is a Run &amp; Gun platformer that follows the titular Joe &amp; Mac as they fight through 12 hellish levels using prehistoric (but not just) tools and weapons. While the game was censored when it came out in the West, the Retro Collection also includes the original Japanese version!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/congos_caper">Congo's Caper</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Congo's Caper</em> (<em>戦え原始人2 ルーキーの冒険</em>) is a side-scrolling Action platformer centered around Congo, a half-human, half-monkey boy looking to rescue his girlfriend from a demon through 35 varied levels."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac_2_lost_in_the_tropics">Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Joe &amp; Mac: Lost in the Tropics</em> (<em>ジョーアンドマック戦え原始人3主役はやっぱり</em>) adds a light roleplaying aspect to the series. While the goal is still to defeat cavemen and dinosaurs, players can court and wed their Stone Age girlfriend, and even have a child with her!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, this collection is comprised of games released here in the West in the early 90s (1991 - 1995) as well as the "uncensored" Japanese versions.</p>
<p>There'll also be "multiple new features" including quality-of-life improvements like the ability to rewind gameplay, save states, customisable aspect ratios, a CRT filter, local co-op for Joe &amp; Mac 1 and 2, and "cool new visuals and merchandise" to go with this Kickstarter.</p>
<p>This campaign is led by G-Mode, Red Art Games and their "award-winning internal studio" Red Art Studios. If you're curious to revisit this prehistoric franchise there are also multiple options on the Switch, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/snes/joe_and_mac">Nintendo's Switch Online Classics</a> game library.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering if it will make a return, Nintendo has already flagged this in its backward compatibility tests, noting how the issue with YouTube is "being investigated".

<p>YouTube asks Switch 2 users to "stay tuned" for updates, so for now, you're going to have to go without this popular video app on your Switch 2.

<figure><a title="Princess Peach: Showtime!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f4e42c306f2f9/princess-peach-showtime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2023 marked a new era for the character, with the legendary voice actor Charles Martinet officially replaced by Kevin Afghani as Mario. It led to questions at the time about what other voices might be swapped out in the future.</p>
<p>While Peach's voice actor Samatha Kelly returned in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> the following year, it seems she's now been replaced after 18 years. This also includes her role as Toad. According to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/">post on her Instagram</a> account, the voice actor found out yesterday after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had been released.</p><p><figure data-videoid="MZ5pbSbsoJA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed41ed20syjgpm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ5pbSbsoJA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Samantha Kelly:</strong> "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I’m sad that it’s over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever. Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles. I’m grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love #princesspeach #toad"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Kelly was in the role for nearly two decades (and voiced various other Mario characters during this time) her departure has obviously been far less public than Charles Martinet, who was given an official send-off by Nintendo and crowed the title of "Mario Ambassador" – going on to promote the character at events.</p>
<p>In some other news, it appears Takashi Nagasako is also reportedly no longer voicing Donkey Kong after 20 years. You can see the latest Mario voice actor update in <a href="https://youtu.be/KCdOTw6qbhs">Mario Kart World's credits</a>.</p>

<p>"Mario Kart World is going to move a lot of Switch 2"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has the most graphical horsepower we've ever seen in the history of the Mario Kart series, and if you're eager to know the exact details about how this game is performing on the Switch 2, Digital Foundry has now delivered its tech review.</p>
<p>In the Switch 2's portable and tabletop mode, racers can expect a resolution of 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"TV image quality is generally fine...holding up well on a 4K television set from a typical viewing distance. Docked mode also gets a touch of post-process image treatment to adjust the 1440p resolution...handheld mode fairs a bit better though, despite its lower pixel count. There's no anti-aliasing of any kind here, so the 1080p pixel count maps perfectly onto the 1080p Switch 2 display."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> was 1080p docked and 720p in portable mode. This results in World looking a "lot cleaner" even if it is still imperfect.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance, Digital Foundry found its experience to be "faultless" - with the frame rate locked at 60fps in the content tested, although photo mode drops the experience to 30fps. On the portable front, it's believed to run at the same frame rate as its docked counterpart.</p>
<p>The team also tested out the split screen as well as the GameChat functionality and found there weren't any performance concerns to the player experience. Regarding load times, these were also "fairly speedy" on the system's internal storage and comparable to a lot of current-generation titles.</p>
<p>HDR is also a nice addition and while it looks decent on TVs, don't expect much from the LCD panel in portable mode. All up, though, Digital Foundry sums up this next-generation entry as a "tremendous accomplishment" and is seriously impressed by the scope of what's been achieved here in terms of the massive open-world scale with very few compromises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visually speaking, World offers some beautiful sights with key rendering advances over prior Mario Kart games, though a lot of rendering power has gone into making the open world work. It's really the incredible quality of Nintendo's artistry that stands out the most here...plus it packs good resolution and frame rate metrics in portable and docked play without the low internal resolutions that typify a lot of early Switch 2 software."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156593/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to put your Switch 2 through its paces, there’s no shortage of options in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">its generous launch lineup</a>. Whether it’s the candy-colored charm of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or the neon-drenched cityscape of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, you’re spoiled for choice when it comes to visual powerhouses.</p>
<p>With such major titles on offer, it would be easy to overlook <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>. Released on other platforms in July 2024, it’s a game that, at first glance, might seem like just another Japanese action game, complete with unwieldy title and familiar feudal-era setting. Jumping into the adventure of the goddess Yoshiro and her faithful protector Soh, I was surprised to find that Capcom’s Shinto-inspired epic is a truly compelling blend of action and tower defence.</p>
<p>The land has been overrun by a demonic force known as the Seethe. Villages surrounding the sacred Mount Kafuku have fallen to corruption. Yoshiro, a divine being, must perform a ritual dance to cleanse each area. Cleansing leaves her vulnerable to attack, which is where her bodyguard Soh comes in. He is tasked with defending the goddess as they move through each settlement, dancing away the evil. Thankfully, Soh won't be alone in this task.</p>

<p>In each area, you cleanse corrupted villagers and assign them combat roles, allowing them to join your fight. You’ll place these villagers in strategic positions around Yoshiro. As night falls, your group must hold their ground against waves of Seethe. The day-night cycle creates a natural ebb and flow of action. During the day, you free villagers, collect crystals, and purge corrupted fauna while a timer counts down to nightfall. Roles are assigned to your fighters using crystals, but this currency is primarily used to carve a path for the ritual. As Soh waves his harai gushi to guide Yoshiro, her progress will determine how many cycles it will take to clear the area. Some will take a single day, most take multiple.</p>
<p>Half ARPG, half tower defence, Kunitsu-Gami is a fascinating and addictive mashup. You control Soh directly, and there’s a beautiful fluidity to his combat. His “blade dance” has a slight delay between input and impact, giving the sensation of gliding through swathes of enemies and cutting them to ribbons. He can attach multiple talismans and tsuba to his gear, which add devastating new abilities or boosts to villagers.</p>
<p>After a settlement is cleared, it becomes a base that you can revisit between rituals. Upgrading these bases provides rewards for both Soh and his growing band of fighters.</p>

<p>Between villages, powerful bosses await, and defeating them earns you a mask that unlocks a new role type to assign to villagers. Boss fights themselves play like a gritty, horror-tinged version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>, as you command fighters to swarm an enemy or defend Yoshiro from adds.</p>
<p>Each villager role has unique utility, from the humble woodcutter to the formidable sorcerer. Selecting the right roles for the right type of enemy or environment is key to Yoshiro’s survival.</p>
<p>The settlements of Mount Kafuku are visually stunning, vibrant dioramas that shift from fleshy hellscape to lush paradise as Yoshiro does their thing. The game runs incredibly well too; Soh slices shafts of bright colour through large groups of enemies without any noticeable frame drops. Performance remains impressive undocked, with the Switch 2’s larger display complementing the top-down environments perfectly. There’s also a healthy selection of visual options (being able to disable motion blur and depth of field is appreciated, Capcom) and accessibility tweaks.</p>

<p>Completing the audio-visual feast is an intoxicating soundscape, which is only slightly marred by a woeful English voice track. Luckily the option to swap to Japanese is available.</p>
<p>Mouse control will be a bit divisive for some. Arguably, this kind of title is well suited to the mouse, as a large chunk of gameplay has you assigning units in the command menu. It took some getting used to, but once I found a comfortable hand position, I enjoyed playing this way. Ultimately, though, I found myself retreating to traditional controls during difficult sections like boss fights. Manoeuvring Soh around enemies while shifting the camera with mouse movement just didn't quite work for me.</p>
<p>Still, even without the extra ways to play that Switch 2 offers, this is a great representation of multiple genres in its own right. It’s a generous title, with plenty of reasons to go back to levels, revealing secrets and unlocking more abilities for Soh and his army.</p>

<p>While each villager role introduces a new strategy and each corrupted settlement adds fresh mechanics, the formula does start to feel slightly repetitive after the midpoint. That said, the core loop of upgrade-plan-defend is addictive and makes Kunitsu-Gami one of the most unique launch titles on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kunitsu-Gami was a real surprise. A solid blend of strategy and action that incorporates aspects of Shinto and Japanese folklore to create a visually stunning experience. It's a great showcase for Switch 2, even if mouse controls might not quite work for everyone.</p></section>
