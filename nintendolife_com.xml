<p>A Switch 1 vs Switch 2 showdown</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption</a> has lassoed its way onto Switch 2 today, bringing with it HDR and DLSS support, mouse controls and a smooth 60fps. The big question is, what does all of this look like in practice, and perhaps more importantly, how does it compare to 2023's Switch port?</p>
<p>Here to answer those very questions is the wonderful Felix Sanchez, who has assembled the above side-by-side comparison video to demonstrate how the fresh Switch 2 version fares against its older hybrid counterpart.</p>
<p>The differences are immediately obvious. The improved frame rate is a welcome sight, and textures are greatly improved on the new hardware, too. Of course, there's no hiding the game's 2010 origins, but the Switch 2 version is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>As a reminder, all those who picked up Red Dead on Switch 1 can upgrade to the new Switch 2 version for free. Otherwise, you'll find the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Red-Dead-Redemption-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2977386.html">eShop</a> for £49.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>We'll have our full thoughts on Red Dead's swanky new upgrade with you soon enough, so keep an eye out!</p>

He was the Lead Architect of the PlayStation Vita, PS4, and PS5 — you might remember him from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8&amp;rco=1">PS5 Pro reveal</a> — and he appears on the most recent episode of Simon Parkin's <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console">My Perfect Console</a> podcast where guests pick five games to immortalise on their very own fictional console.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there's plenty of Sony chat in there, but that didn't stop a little slice of unexpected Nintendo discussion slipping in there, too. As it turns out, Cerny is a bit of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> fan at heart, and if that isn't something all of us <em>capital-G</em> <em>Gamers</em> can agree on, then we don't know what is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0lwuoqh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Olimar's escapades cropped up as Cerny described playing the first game as a "transformative" experience. "That first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure," Cerny told Parkin, remembering the game's "emotionally involving story" of Olimar's attempts to return home.</p>
<p>Here's the full quote, so you can read his thoughts for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don't know, Portal or Plants vs Zombies or Flower or Katamari Damacy. Pikmin I just pick out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story. Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands and he's got 30 days to reassemble his ship or he'll run out of oxygen and die and he's sending letters home every day.</p>
<p>"And for me that was just transformative. I mean, I guess I'm a sucker when it comes to story, right? But then for Pikmin 2, it's totally different. So they're on Earth, they're running around picking up trash on Earth. That's the storyline, if you recall. Literally, you're running around somebody's bathroom floor in Pikmin 2. And in one of those, you're running from debt collectors, if I have that right.</p>
<p>"But that first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerny has had strong connections with various studios throughout his career (he designed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/marble_madness">Marble Madness</a> at Atari and worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_sonic_the_hedgehog_2">Sonic 2</a> after helping to establish Sega Technical Institute). The games we associate with this industry figure would likely have more of a PlayStation flavour these days, though, so it's nice to see Pikmin sneaking into his top five. Those delightful little sprouts are the ultimate gaming unifier, eh?</p>
<p>You'll have to listen to the full podcast episode (now on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/sg/podcast/my-perfect-console-with-simon-parkin/id1665581266">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6PzHHkwpOs8YFgzqoKRXAi">Spotify</a>, and all the usual places) to hear Cerny's complete 'Perfect Console' picks, and hey, that's not a bad way to spend an evening.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/switch-2-exclusive-drag-x-drive-scores-its-second-major-update-heres-whats-included</link>
            <guid>1370029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>The Switch 2 and eShop exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has today received a new game update, bumping it up to Version 1.2.0.</p>
<p>This follows an update in September and comes loaded with general updates (such as adding the chasing game Survival Tag to multiple modes) and multiple fixes. It also makes some changes to Drag x Drive: Global Jam. It's been renamed the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-demos-list-every-switch-2-game-with-an-eshop-demo-available">Drag x Drive Demo</a></strong> and certain bot games can be played at any time.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Drag x Drive - Version 1.2.0 (Released 1st December, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the chasing game Survival Tag to friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: To play Survival Tag when in the parks listed above, the player who created the park opens the X Menu, then selects <strong>Start Survival Tag</strong> on the Players tab.</li>
<li>Depending on the wireless environment, there may be times where player positioning does not perfectly match between users. For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression. Therefore, it has been designed such that a tag is considered successful if there was contact from either perspective (the tagging player, or the one who was tagged).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrected the calculation of Iso Wins on the Game Stats tab under Stats. Previously, it counted the total number of Isos, not just wins.</li>
<li>Added Rope Jumps to Other Stats tab under Stats.</li>
<li>Changed the target of the Focus Cam when near the sumo ring to the sumo ring itself.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to bots in friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: We slightly lowered the strength level of the Easy and Standard bots that the player who created the park can add under the Players tab of the X Menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a feature to enable players to delete their own records.
<ul>
<li>On the screen that displays players’ records before starting time trials or shooting contests, simultaneously press and hold the ZL Button, left directional button, and right directional button on the Joy-Con 2 (L) for 10 seconds to delete the record.</li>
<li>Once deleted, records cannot be restored.</li>
<li>Obtained trophies will remain, even if records are deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a very rare issue where, due to unintended behavior, the displays for level or total distance would reach the upper limit.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue in Circuit Sprint where players sometimes passed through terrain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bunny hops made it possible to accelerate to and maintain speed that exceeded top speed.
<ul>
<li>The intended design is that it is only possible to accelerate beyond the normal top speed when driving down a slope or successfully pulling off a halfpipe or ramp trick. However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed. We fixed this because this issue required players to control their character in unintuitive ways in order to achieve good results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Version 1.1.1 for the <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em> (formerly <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em>) was also released.</p>
<p><strong>General Updates (Demo)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed software title from <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em> to <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em>.</li>
<li>Changed the software icon that displays in locations such as the HOME Menu.</li>
<li>Made it possible to play the tutorial and certain bot games any time.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about the existing update in our previous post. And if you want to learn more about this demo, check out our Nintendo Life review. Here's what we had to say in our written review, and you can check out our video version at the top of this page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans. Add in some pals, and you've got a solid bit of fun for the price."</p>

<p>This bundle deal is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy for <strong>$449</strong> instead of the usual $499, so you're saving $50. This is the first time the bundle has been on sale in this location and gives you access to the new entry in the Mario Kart series at no extra cost (instead of having to fork out extra).</p>
<p>A regular Switch 2 bundle is normally priced at $449, so this current offer on the Mario Kart World bundle brings it down to the same price. Nintendo also previously mentioned how the Mario World Bundle would be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-will-be-a-limited-time-offer">"limited time production" through to Fall 2025</a> in the US and is available "while supplies last".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has only recently passed the six-month mark in its life, and Nintendo has not officially discounted or reduced the price of the new unit, so this latest offer might be worth considering if you were hoping to save some coin.</p>
