            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Switch is 'fine'. For a lot of people, that'll be enough. And certainly, even I'm surprised it's as stable as it is after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> had more than their fair share of performance woes — the latter of which is almost a completely different game with the free Switch 2 patch.</p>
<p>But, this should go without saying, If you have the newer console and you want Legends: Z-A, get it on there. You can read my general thoughts on the entire game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">in my review</a>, but performance-wise, 60fps, sharper image quality, and better stability means it's a stronger experience overall by a wide margin on the Switch 2.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:192371 @ 1760723730 -->
<p>I was honestly expecting this version to be a disaster, but I'm happy to say Legends: Z-A maintains a relatively consistent 30fps both handheld and docked. The drop is certainly noticeable coming off of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>, but if you're playing this fresh, it likely won't bother you.</p>
<p>What <em>might</em> catch you out, however, are some pretty noticeably choppy 'cuts'. There's a lot more camera work in Legends: Z-A, from fast-panning shots to cutaways, and while docked, every single one of these staggered. Zooming into a trainer after defeating them, catching a Pokémon unaware in the Z-A Royale, there's a stutter every single time. I didn't notice it as much while handheld, but it was distracting.</p>
<p>Luckily, things are more consistent in battle, where things can get a little chaotic. Some moves like Brutal Swing and Gust can cause frames to dip slightly, particularly in handheld, but for the most part, things are good enough.</p>
<p>The visuals are one of my bigger issues with the Switch 2 version, and understandably, it's the same story here, despite the fact character models look good. Flat textures are even worse on Switch 1 — blades of grass looks blurry and jagged, bushes and trees are angular, and the cobbles just look fuzzy. Oh, and the shadows are abysmal, pixelated and blurry and sometimes not even there.</p>
<p>Pop-in was an issue on the new console too, but here, it's even worse. Sometimes characters and Mega Crystals will be visible from a fair distance, while other times, they won't appear until you're about 10 steps away from them. It's incredibly inconsistent and distracting. Some building textures will take around 6-7 seconds to load in, despite the fact you're staring right at them.</p>
<p>Longer load times and softer image quality are a couple more (expected) nicks in the older hardware version's armour, but overall, despite my complaints, Legends: Z-A on Switch is.... okay! It's a step up from the last two mainline games, but still far from Pokémon's best-looking titles.</p>
<p>And I think it's the Switch 1 version's fault. I absolutely get why Z-A is on the older console; The Pokémon Company isn't going to give up that huge player base with a mainline game yet. But its limitations hold Lumiose City back from its full potential. What could've been a vibrant, varied city instead comes with caveats, restrictions, and a fair few visual compromises.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="c24948fdaa810"><a title="Taunie Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c24948fdaa810/taunie-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Pokémon</strong> games have never, at least to our knowledge, had voice-over work. At least not the mainline games or direct spin-offs.</p>
<p>For many, especially those who have been with the series since the very beginning, this hasn't really been much of an issue. After all, it was only when Pokémon had properly transitioned into the 3D realm with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X and Y</a> that characters actually started articulating their joints while talking, and even then it was <em>very</em> limited.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, however, it feels a bit different. Yes, visuals are still somewhat lacklustre across the board with this latest entry, but character animation, particularly during cutscenes, is actually pretty good. They move like real people are supposed to, and their mouths are lip-synced with the dialogue.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59ksrnpg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The problem..? There's no verbal audio to go with the dialogue. It's <em>still</em> completely silent.</p>
<p>It's pretty noticeable in the below clip doing the rounds on social media, with many noting that supporting character Taunie animates well, but the lack of any voice-over makes it come off a bit, well... weird:</p>

<p>Heck, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">final verdict</a> on Legends: Z-A even highlighted the lack of any voice-over work, with reviewer Alana Hagues stating the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know this is controversial, too, but voices would help give this game character. I’m not even asking for full voice acting — though monologues and pre-rendered cutscenes feel utterly bizarre as just text on a screen — but I’d love a voice clip or two, along the lines of modern Zelda games. It’d also help give the story a little more <em>oomph</em>, which it needs when focusing on friendship, recovery, and forgiveness. Even with an explosive climax (which I urge you not to spoil yourself on), I felt... nothing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we'd like to put it to you fine folks. Is Legends: Z-A worse off without any voice-over work? Should Game Freak endeavour to add this into future titles? Let us know by voting in the below polls and sharing a comment in the usual place.</p>
