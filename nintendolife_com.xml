<figure><a title="grounded peer to peer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/29ce1cc0c3a7d/grounded-peer-to-peer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Obsidian</em></figcaption></figure><p>We reviewed Obsidian's excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> back when it released on Switch last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grounded">giving it a 7/10</a> and remarking that it was really only the game's performance on the console that held it back from a much better score.</p>
<p>Indeed, Grounded, when it's running well, is perhaps one of our favourite survival games of the past console generation or two. With this in mind, and given that the game does now perform better if you happen to have a Switch 2 (well, it's much less blurry, that's for sure), Switch players may be wondering if it's going to suddenly disappear, now that the dev has moved onto the final prep phase for Grounded 2 (which sadly is only aiming at xbox and PC, for now).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zvkjyr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Thankfully, during an interview (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Eurogamer</a>) the game's executive producer, Marcus Morgan, has said that, "We actually have this strong passion to ensure our games can stand the test of time and keep updating through history...There's a strong desire on our side to make sure that our games are preserved,"</p>
<p>He continued, "Now, are we going to be doing content and these story expansions to Grounded 1? No, that's the continuation of Grounded 2. But even as recently as April we released 1.4.7 to Grounded 1, so there's a maintenance and a desire that that game will always exist. So we'll keep that up, it's not going anywhere if people still want to play Grounded 1 as well." They did also give us gyro controls in an update last year, so you can't knock the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Recently, of course, there's been a little extra attention on what happens with games when they've had their time in the limelight, with groups such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">Stop Killing Games</a> drawing attention to the issues faced when games are taken offline.</p>
<p>To this end, Morgan gets a little more detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the things that we did in terms of how we structured Grounded is multiplayer is done through peer-to-peer, which in first blush, feels antiquated versus dedicated servers. But we were able to blend that with shared worlds, and what that does is it allows you, effectively, a cloud save that you can share with your friends. So it gives that experience of being able to have a more dedicated server vibe, but it doesn't have that same requirement of actually having servers.</p>
<p>And this is no commentary on the Stop Killing Games stuff or anything like that...More to say it does establish (the game) so it can exist into the future a lot easier than if you're on the other side, where you are more of a server-based game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while we wait and hope that Grounded gets one last switch drop in the form of a gentle Switch 2 upgrade (you know you want to, Obsidian), us Grounded fans can at least rest assured in the knowledge that the game isn't just gonna disappear on us. Probably.</p>

<p>For those pro moments</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Elgato has announced that its latest 4K-capable capture card, the cunningly-named Elgato 4K S, is 100% compatible with the Switch 2 - and it's a<a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/game-capture-4k-s">vailable for purchase right now!</a> (Thanks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elgatos-new-game-capture-4k-s-is-switch-2-compatible-164745527.html">Engadget</a>).</p>
<p>The 4K S, which is also the most budget-friendly card in Elgato's range, coming in at a price of $159.99/£149.99, sits externally to almost any console you can think of, to capture your latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> antics at up to 4K/60fps with zero-latency passthrough.</p>
<p>The card replaces the ever-popular Elgato HD60 X, which was only capable of 4k/30fps (and was more expensive at launch), and you can betcha there's gonna be some clamouring for them right here at Nintendo Life HQ. Oh yes, sir.</p>
<p>Here's some more official details from Elgato:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Capture in True 4K60<br></strong>Capture crystal-clear 4K gameplay at a silky-smooth 60 frames per second. Colors pop, details shine, and your footage looks amazing in every moment. On Windows, you can even capture vibrant 1080p HDR gameplay, perfect for bringing cinematic moments to life.</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay First, Capture Second<br></strong>4K S keeps your games smooth and responsive while you record. You can:<br>
Enjoy full <strong>4K60 passthrough</strong> with <strong>HDR and VRR</strong>, so your gameplay stays crisp and tear-free<br>
Chasing higher frame rates? Play at up to <strong>1080p240</strong> or <strong>1440p144</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next-gen ready by design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2<br></strong>Capture gameplay in 4K60, 1440p120, or 1080p60 HDR while you play titles like <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Capture Audio, Your Way<br></strong>Thanks to 4K S’s ultra-low latency, you don’t need extra gear to monitor or record game audio.<br>
Need real-time audio to your headset? Chat Link Pro delivers zero-latency audio for both game and chat, ideal when timing is everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we're off to grab one of these new cards to record some primo footage of our best run in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/balan_wonderworld">Balan Wonderworld.</a> Beautiful 4K Wonderworld...</p>

<p><em><br>

Firstly, the game will run at "mostly around 30fps", with some supposed dips during more intense moments.</p>
<p>This reportedly follows previous comments from Pitchford about how the <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/borderlands-4-is-targeting-60-fps-gearbox-ceo-addresses-balance-concerns">new entry was aiming for 60fps on consoles</a> – with the final decision about the frame rate in the Switch 2 version apparently based on the developer not wanting to "cut anything", including cross-play support.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-1ksWY9W4EA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed39956flqpmnt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ksWY9W4EA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Randy Pitchford:</strong> "It was important to us to not cut anything and to support cross play with other platforms. So, no. It'll be mostly around 30 fps, with some dips in some intense moments, heavy combat or if hosting a multiplayer game in handheld mode, etc."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to this, it's also been confirmed the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 will require a download "even for physical copies" of the game – so expect a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>And as for the current <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/borderlands_3_ultimate_edition">Borderlands 3</a> performance issues on Switch 2, when asked about this, Pitchford noted how this title was obviously not made to run on the Switch 2. Gearbox will supposedly need "some help" and "some time" to see what it can do with this in the future, but for now, the focus is on Borderlands 4.</p>

<p>Following an update earlier this month, Toby Fox's latest game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> has now been updated to Version 1.03.</p>
<p>This latest update includes improvements to Chapter 2, 3 and 4, along with various other changes. This includes multiple fixes across each chapter, including some softlock fixes, and there are also some fixes tied to minor graphical errors.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/deltarune-1-02-update-out-now-patch-notes/" rel="noopener">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<h3>Deltarune Version 1.03</h3>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<ul>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a softlock in the part where you catch mice in a basket on your head.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Swords used in a certain boss’s “Sword Tunnel” attack now have a reduced hit box relative to the graphic, making the attack easier to dodge.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock on the Board 1 that could occur after using only three keys.</li>
<li>Fixed a soft lock if a party member fails to reach the Power Croissant.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash if you pushed a pyramid the wrong way.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where on certain platforms, the sprites of the game would become blurry after the Tenna scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<ul>
<li>If you lose to Jackenstein 2 times in a row, the amount of damage that the chasing pumpkin deals will be halved. If you lose 3 times in a row, TP gain will be increased by 50%. These changes will allow players who find this battle difficult to progress past it more easily.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock which could occur if the tutu was not returned to you.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where normal battle music would not play if you fought Mike at the beginning of the game. (This issue becomes resolved after fighting Jackenstein.)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with a hitbox not working when a boss dives at you from many different directions. (The hitbox will be adjusted more later)</li>
<li>Fixed an impossible note on the song “Knock you Down!!” in the rhythm game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Kris would still appear to be wearing their church clothes even though they’d been removed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where asking Ralsei advice for a puzzle would simply result in him saying a single button.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing octaves on the giant piano organ thing could freeze the game.</li>
<li>Susie and Ralsei no longer erroneously appear in the rhythm game at Castle Town at the end of the Chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various Chapters</p>
<ul>
<li>[Console-only] Fixed an issue where changing the language setting would also change the border setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the intro prophecy would always be skipped after selecting a chapter using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed a few minor textual errors.</li>
<li>Fixed various minor graphical errors.</li>
<li>Various other minor fixes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Following Mario Kart World's launch in June</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Toadette - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/873c1c5d48a98/toadette-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, it's clear the restrictions on the voice actor reveals for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> have officially lifted at this point, and more of the talent is now revealing who they played in the Switch 2 launch title.</p>
<p>Following the update on Peach yesterday (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/princess-peachs-new-voice-actor-has-been-confirmed">and also who voiced the NPC Toads in the game</a>), we've now got the confirmation of the <em>main</em> Toad's voice actor. This character is played by Laila Berzins and was formerly voiced by Samantha Kelly. Berzins has been credited on projects like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/genshin_impact">Genshin Impact</a></strong> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> series.</p>
<p>The voice actor officially confirmed this in an announcement on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am overjoyed to be able to finally announce that I voice Toad in Mario Kart World. Being a part of such an iconic franchise, let alone one of my favorite characters is a dream come true.</p>
<p>I am so inspired by the magnificient Toads before me; Jen Taylor and Samantha Kelley. The gaming community owes them a huge debt of gratitude for the years they've spent bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>I hope to do this little mushroom proud! He’s a fun guy! Get it? Fungi? Anyway…Immensely grateful to Nintendo America and cupofteastudios. Here we go!</p>

<p>Additionally, Laura Stahl has confirmed she's playing Toadette in Mario Kart World. She's previously played roles in series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_engage">Fire Emblem</a> (Alear) and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> series. Here's what she had to say about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peeking out of a social media hiatus to share that I am the voice of Toadette in Mario Kart World! grateful to @Cupofteaprod and @NintendoAmerica for the opportunity! I'm still in disbelief, and so, so grateful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see the names of all these voice actors in the Mario Kart World credits, although their specific character roles are not listed. This follows on from the confirmation of DK and Pauline's voice actors in the latest Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
