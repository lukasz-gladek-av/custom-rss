<p>Bulk Up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Okay, this might be one of the most genius marketing collaborations ever: the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (better known as CMLL) has teamed up with <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/tune-in-to-the-pokemon-legends-z-a-cmll-lucha-libre-wrestling-event-on-youtube">The Pokémon Company</a> to promote Pokémon Legends: Z-A in the best way possible — a Mexican wrestling event (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-crashes-cmll-wrestling-event-with-wrestlers-dressed-as-machamp-and-hawlucha/">VGC</a>!).</p>
<p>The <strong>Noche de Leyendas</strong> (literally Night of Legends) was a match to the "death" between Team Hawlucha — consisting of Místico, Máscara Dorada and Titán — and Team Machamp — made up of Volador Jr., Hechicero and Bárbaro Cavernario.</p>
<p>Wrestlers donned a variety of Pokémon-inspired costumes. A few of the ones we've spotted are Togepi, Arcanine, and Sylveon, but the headline act of course were Hawlucha and Machamp. And all the action takes place in a Pokémon stadium-style ring.</p>
<p>The entire 2 hours 30 minutes are worth watching whether you're a fan of wrestling or not; it's such a fantastic display of showmanship and drama. Plus, it's just good Mexican Wrestling, all wrapped in a Pokémon package.</p>

<p>This event was announced way back when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-mega-evolution-looks-particularly-snazzy">Mega Hawlucha was unveiled</a> about a month ago. Honestly, it's the perfect way to promote both the new Mega, the CMLL, and the upcoming Switch and Switch 2 game.</p>
<p>Don't forget, we've recently spent even more time checking out Legends Z-A, so make sure to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pokemon-legends-z-as-combat-shines-brightly-but-its-visuals-are-still-dull">our hands-on preview</a>.</p>
