<p>This update officially kicks off the Switch 2's life with a stability update, but nothing else is revealed in these patch notes. This follows on from Version 20.1.1 which was released earlier this month, and contained some minor fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown of the latest system update, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>

<p>If you're not prompted to update your system, you can manually enter the system's settings from the home menu on both the Switch and Switch 2, scroll down to the "system" option and performance a "system update" from here.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also been updating many of its games over the past week, including its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d56a77abbe84c/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has now aired its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct and sure enough, it had quite a few surprises to share.</p>
<p>This included the official reveal of Pauline, the return of many of Donkey Kong's old friends and additional features such as amiibo support and Game Share. Along with this, it looks like the gameplay will offer plenty of variety beyond destruction – with transformations, big boss battles, and much more.</p>
<p>So, now that we've had some time to take it all in, we're wondering if the community is sold on this new Donkey Kong game yet, or still needs some more time to decide. Vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:180580 @ 1750296880 -->

<p>Once again, Donkey Kong Bananza will launch exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 next month on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. The Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo figure is also due out on the same date.</p>

<figure><a title="The House of the Dead 2: Remake 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829dbc3fb109d/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>An arcade light gun classic is coming out on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> as Forever Entertainment's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a> brings zombies, bullets, and gore to Switch. The game was originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/house-of-the-dead-2-remake-blasts-onto-switch-this-spring">aiming for Spring</a>, but we're a little past that at this point!</p>
<p>Taking on the role as either James Taylor or Gary Stewart, you'll be blasting your way through a city that's been overrun by, well, the dead, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>The remake brings updated graphics and remastered music (and the ability to swap to the old music), but remains pretty faithful to the 1998 original. You can blast through the Classic Campaign, Boss Mode, or a Training Mode either on your own or with a buddy — the Gary to your James, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">first remake</a>, this one's being developed by MegaPixel Studio; unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-remake">we didn't love our time with the first game</a> back when it launched in 2022, as it was plagued with control and performance issues. Let's hope things are fixed for the sequel, which we have fond memories with on the Dreamcast.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/422efc4616565/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Oof</em>, well this has been <em>quite</em> the day for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> content, eh? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">spotlight Direct</a> was absolutely jam-packed with DK goodness, revealing some familiar faces, highlighting a bunch of gameplay mechanics and announcing enough collectibles to make even the most tentative completionist break out in a sweat. On top of all that, we've also got a new batch of screenshots — like we said, what a day!</p>
<p>The freshly-baked screens cover a lot of the same ground that you will have seen in the Direct, but it's a nice chance to stop for a minute and <em>really</em> soak up some of the details. Scrolling through them got us feeling sufficiently pumped for the game's <strong>17th July</strong> release date, and we thought it would be only fair to share them all with you lovely lot too.</p>
<p>So, let's check out some of these sweet snaps, shall we? Starting with the surprise reveal that started it all: Pauline!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184093 @ 1750296500 -->
<p>And how about those vistas? Just imagine the punching potential...</p>



<p>Next, let's have a look at the three Bananza Transformations, which will see DK morph into a giant gorilla, a speedy zebra and a flying ostrich, each with its own special abilities:</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184091 @ 1750297944 -->
<p>We've got a handful of gameplay screenshots too, so you can see what exploration and Challenge Courses will look like when treated to some HUD magic:</p>


<p>And we haven't forgotten about you menu fans, either. We'll round things out with a closer look at the in-game map, the DK Art mode, and a handful of shop and Skill Point menus:</p>

<hr>
<p>We're imagine we'll hear a little more from Donkey Kong Bananza before it swings its way to Switch 2 on 17th July, but for now, at least, you can consider us sufficiently hyped!</p>
