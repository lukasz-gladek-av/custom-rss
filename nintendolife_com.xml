<p>One launch game for the Switch 2 that didn't get a rosy reception was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>. This interactive exhibit allowed users to get up close with the new hybrid system and learn all about its fancy features and tech.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many fans were upset about Nintendo releasing this game as a paid title instead of a free bonus alongside the system. With this in mind, GameStop has now officially awarded this "interactive instruction booklet" with its "Worst Game of the Year" award. It managed to beat <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mindseye">MindsEye</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> and the all-time classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/superman_the_new_adventures">Superman 64</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bZE9oIFPXWw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbZE9oIFPXWw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5bdf6fwgtvys&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>If you couldn't already tell, this whole awards show is actually a joke. GameStop also gave itself "The Game Store of the Year" award, and it awarded Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter epic <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_3">Halo 3</a> the 2025 "Game of the Year" - beating out <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> and a bunch of other titles (<em>you can't argue with this one</em>).</p>

<p>On a <em>slightly</em> more serious note, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> won GameStop's "Best Nintendo Game of the Year". Oh, and Charizard won the "best Pokémon Card of the Year" award.</p>

<p>If you can look past the price, in all seriousness, Welcome Tour is still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">a delightful and informative piece of software</a>. You can see our full review for this and Donkey Kong's latest outing here on Nintendo Life.

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> got an update which added a "Year in Review" feature to the application. Nintendo has now officially made this available to Switch Online members.</p>
<p>To access it, all you need to do is open Nintendo Music and there should be a big "2025 Year in Review" banner at the top of the home page. From here, you'll be able to see your total play time for the year, your most-played tracks, along with your most-played playlist and soundtrack of the year.</p>
<p>This Year in Review is available to view until <strong>5th January 2026</strong>, so check it out while it's available.</p>


<p>Apart from this, Nintendo has also added two new playlists including songs added to Nintendo Music in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, earlier this week Nintendo added the Switch soundtrack <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yoshis_crafted_world">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> to its music app.</p>

<p>An absolute Treasure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a> for the N64 'Nintendo Classics' library, Nintendo has today released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wario_world">Wario World</a> for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack GameCube service.</p>
<p>This game was developed by the talented Japanese team Treasure (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/gunstar_heroes">Gunstar Heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/sin_and_punishment">Sin and Punishment</a>), and was locally released on the GameCube in 2003. It's also Wario's first and only 3D platformer. Here's the official description about this "garlic-fueled rampage", courtesy of Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Go on a garlic-fueled rampage in this action title released for the Nintendo GameCube™ system in 2003! Wario's journey begins with a promise of vengeance against a powerful and cursed black jewel that's warped his castle and nabbed his treasure. Defeat enemies, collect coins and treasures, and rescue Spritelings trapped in boxes as you progress through four stages. Wario's got some mighty powerful moves, like Wild Swing-Ding and Piledriver, that aren't just good for attacking—they're also slick at clearing path-blocking traps."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan has received the same title this week. Here are some screenshots of the title from Nintendo's Japanese website:</p>

<p>Since the launch of the GameCube 'Nintendo Classics' service in June, Nintendo has added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>. These games joined <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also teased a bunch of upcoming titles for this library such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.</p>
