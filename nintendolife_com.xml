There's nothing quite as soul-crushing as when a new piece of tech gets a nasty dent on the casing or a horrible scratch on the screen. It feels like the end of the world.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, reports are starting to emerge that the screen is proving to be particularly susceptible to scratches, with a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spintherism/">Spintherism</a> gathering plenty of comments from users stating that their own consoles are becoming all scratched up.</p>
<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTrueBrawler2001/">TheTrueBrawler2001</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yep, my Switch 2 got scratched from the dock. I've confirmed with my retailer that I can trade it in for a new one once they receive more inventory, but I'm out of luck until then. Already purchased a screen protector in anticipation. If I get a new Switch 2 before it arrives, then I'm not even opening the Switch 2 box until then so I can put it on immediately and protect the new screen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even our own lovely video producer Felix has confirmed that his Switch 2 has received a fair few light scratches since launch. The general consensus seems to be that, like the Switch OLED before it, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2s-screen-comes-with-a-pre-applied-film-layer-dont-peel-it-off">actually the protective plastic film getting all scratched up</a>, not the screen itself.</p>
<p>That would be fine – reassuring, even – but Nintendo has explicitly stated that users should not remove the protective film in order to prevent shards of glass flying about in the event of a severe breakage. So with that in mind, yes, the screen is effectively getting all scratched up, even though it <em>technically</em> isn't.</p>
<p>Touch wood, this writer hasn't experienced anything of the sort yet (<em>though I do also have an extra screen protector applied, just in case</em>), but we'd now like to hand it over to you. Has your Switch 2's screen gathered any nasty scratches yet?</p>
