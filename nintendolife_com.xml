<p>Motion sickness doing the rounds</p>

<figure><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71ebb8791d54c/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is out now, and it seems that the <em>vast</em> majority of people have been thoroughly enjoying DK's latest adventure on Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to some reports, however, it seems a small minority have been experiencing some pretty severe motion sickness with the game. This came to our attention via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1m1p5vm/playing_dk_bananza_atm_and_got_extremely_nauseous/">Reddit</a> thread in which user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vruchtenhagel/">vruchtenhagel</a> said that they "got extremely nauseous in the first 45 minutes".</p>
<p>The thread has since garnered over 250 comments, some from folks experiencing similar issues, and others kindly offering potential fixes to alleviate the effects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4torsuq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bgrandis7/">bgrandis7</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was looking for someone who had a similar experience to mine! I felt really, really sick in the first area as well, never had something like that happen to me before.</p>
<p>"I think the zooming in and out from 1st and 3rd person on Ingot Isle might be the culprits. I really hope the next areas are less cramped and the camera can be a bit further away."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-motion-sickness-settings/">Nintendo Everything</a>, you can try disabling the motion controls and screen shake via Bananza's options menu to potentially help with the problem. Some commenters in the Reddit thread have stated that such actions have unfortunately not helped, while others have said that it does indeed reduce the motion sickness.</p>
<p>So, we thought we'd put it to you fine folks and see if this really is a potential issue. Have you been feeling any motion sickness from Donkey Kong Bananza? Why not let us know by voting in the below poll and expounding with a comment while you're at it.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uk-charts-donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-hit-but-sells-less-then-half-of-super-mario-odyssey</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6f9923c11682/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts data is in, and as expected, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a hit, climbing all the way to the top to beat the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p>
<p>How well it <em>actually</em> sold, however, is a little bit more difficult to gauge. According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a>' Chris Dring, Bananza sold three times that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> on the Switch, but less than half of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the obvious conclusion that we could come to is that digital sales far outweigh physical in 2025, but while the balance has certainly tipped <em>ever-so-slightly</em> in favour of digital, Switch owners still really value their physical games. In response to a post stating that more people buy digital over physical, Dring stated "Not so much on Switch. A little more".</p>
<p>It's a weird situation, then. One other potential explanation is that by the time Super Mario Odyssey launched in October 2017, Nintendo had sold a lot more Switch consoles since its release in March the same year. We're looking at between 14-15 million Switch consoles sold by the time Odyssey launched.</p>
<p>Bananza releasing less than two months after the Switch 2 dropped means that there are simply fewer consoles in consumers' hands – thus fewer sales. We also have to consider that, despite Nintendo's efforts to boost DK's appeal in recent years, Mario as an IP likely still commands a lot more attention.</p>
<p>Still, we're pleased to see Bananza top the charts – may its success continue in the weeks, months, and years to come!</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

<p>This follows compatibility fixes for multiple titles in June for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros.

<p>The games have vastly expanded since those nostalgic '90s days, going from only eight characters and 20 tracks, to the vast roster and open world of the latest entry.</p>
<p>There have been some constants over the years, though. The notorious blue shell, for instance (which debuted in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">Mario Kart 64</a>), and being flagged to 'Go!" or fished out of the water by Lakitu on his little cloud.

<p>Mario Kart is all about having fun with friends, and what better way to continue that fun than by bringing everyone’s favourite video game characters to life in a cosplay <em>group</em>. Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and Toad are four mains that Nintendo fans have loved since the start. As well as being some of Nintendo’s oldest avatars, they appeared as four of the eight original playable characters in the SNES original (although Donkey Kong was represented by his father, Donkey Kong Jr., in the first game).</p>
<p>Australian cosplayers Marvellous_cosplay and liormora_cosplay have crafted many costumes of their favourite characters over the years. They love to play the Mario Kart games together, and so decided to put together their own versions of Luigi and Toad.</p>
<p>As well as putting together the costumes, they also assembled the karts using cardboard, paint, and plenty of hot glue. Cosplay couple astrocyte_cosplay joined the group as Mario and Donkey Kong with their own outfits and handmade karts for the group to race around their local convention.</p>

The pink pigtailed 'ette has appeared in multiple games from the series since her debut, finally making it as a default, dont-need-to-unlock character in Mario Kart World. As well as the kart racing games, Toadette has shown up in many <strong>Mario Party</strong> and <strong>Mario Sports</strong> games, not to mention several Mario platformers, but she got her start in a kart!</p>
<p>US cosplayer CandiceBCosplay captures Toadette’s playful side perfectly in her cosplay made to pair up with a friend’s Nintendo cosplay at a convention. Attending conventions since 2018, Candice wanted to make a character that is rare to see on the con floor. Toadette’s signature style includes her pink spotted head, which CandiceB said was her favourite part of the costume to make.</p>

<p>Daisy is one of the three main princesses in the Mario franchise, each being a ruler of a different kingdom. Reigning over Sarasaland since 1989, Daisy has arguably been seen to have more of a tomboy and adventurous nature than Peach or Rosalina.</p>
<p>It is that difference in Daisy that has given German cosplayer Anthea a love of the character since childhood. The lack of pink resonated with Anthea, and Princess Daisy helped her to feel secure in herself and about not liking stereotypically feminine things as a child. Daisy was always Anthea’s main pick, so her racing suit had been on her list to make for a long time.</p>
<p>This cosplay was Anthea’s first attempt to make a bodysuit, and the extra touch of the racing flag really adds to it.</p>

<p>Waluigi is the mysterious bad-boy counterpart to Luigi that originally appeared as Wario’s double partner in the Mario Tennis games. He is quite often seen as the sidekick to Wario, with his first kart-driving appearance in Mario Kart: Double Dash.</p>
<p>Waluigi appealed to Quinnjob because of that mystery behind the slender villain. Not knowing much about him and his adventures, he recognised that Waluigi has a sizeable fan base. Quinnjob added prosthetics and makeup to the cosplay that really emphasised the character’s troublemaker side.</p>
<p>Quinnjob also does vinyl wraps professionally, so as part of the cosplay he did a custom Waluigi kart vinyl wrap to take it one step further. The next stage for Quinnjob is to get a full group of Mario Kart cosplayers together.</p>

<figure><a title="Lakitu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc4c11015e576/lakitu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosplays_from_trash/?hl=en">Cosplays_from_trash</a></em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Lakitu is a classic Mario Kart character who appears throughout the series. Being the <em>real</em> MVP of the games, Lakitu not only tells everyone when they can go, but also plops you back on track when you've gone off course. This cloud-riding Koopa has appeared in every Mario Kart game since the start, and even gets behind the wheel himself in the more recent entries.</p>
<p>Cosplay_from_Trash hates waste and uses his platform to champion creativity, sustainability, and community in-person and online. He has had an appreciation of Lakitu since MK64 and thought it would be an easy cosplay, but found making a cloud that stays around your waist and a backpack in the shape of a shell more difficult than expected.</p>
<p>He made the backpack base from a bucket, and the cloud base from elastic and a tightly bunched comforter. His favourite part of the cosplay is the cloud batting from the inside of the comforter.</p>
