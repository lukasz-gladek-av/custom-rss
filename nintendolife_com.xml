<figure><a title="game-key card survey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/57a37548ce9af/game-key-card-survey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has already been doing a little surveying and gathering of feedback, as we reported a few weeks back, with regards to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-is-seeking-player-feedback-on-game-key-cards-in-japan">physical and digital games, including how game-key cards are going down.</a> Spoiler alert: they aren't really going down very well at all.</p>
<p>Now, and as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">Eurogamer</a>, the Big N is back at it, with a fresh survey for those interested to get busy filling in. Indeed, you can <a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM?key=f2ff4cc19b9b3818&amp;cid=BAPSurveys&amp;eid=BAPSurvey0730_0127&amp;crmid=095575FC-0293-4888-8F7A-DD6D22045DA4">click right here</a> to go do just that.</p>
<p>This latest survey asks a whole bunch of questions related to how you feel about purchasing digital and physical media in various ways.</p>
<p>As you can see from our screens, they mostly want to know how strongly you feel about the physical game card actually having the game, whether or not you care about that, and how whether being in a store or buying online affects your thinking. Stuff like that, mate.</p>
<p>It all points to the fact that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/furukawas-defence-of-game-key-cards-aint-all-that-convincing">Nintendo know people don't really care for the game-key card situation.</a></p>

<p>Anyhow. This survey is a good chance, whatever your thoughts, to get stuck into letting them be known loud and clear. So, make sure to get clicking on those multiple choice answers (it took us about four minutes to complete, for what it's worth).</p>
<p>Of course, despite multiple complaints from Switch 2 owners, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">developers have been praising Game-Key Cards</a>, so it seems unlikely they'll be going anywhere for a while now...</p>
<p>If you want some more thoughts about the physical, digital, and Gam-Key Card discussion, our lovely Zion made a video all about it following last week's Partner Showcase, so have a watch:</p>

<p><em>Have any strong opinions left about game-key cards at this point? Let us kn</em>ow in the comments!</p>

<p>I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced that its new retro-inspired metroidvania <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> will launch on the Switch next month on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Loosely based on the 2600 title <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from creator Warren Robinett, Adventure of Samsara looks pretty awesome and we're really digging the whole retro vibe. But to be honest, we're still struggling somewhat to see the connection to the 1980 original beyond a couple of dragons and whatnot.</p>
<p>Though to be fair, Adventure's visuals were so basic at the time, you could interpret the presentation in a number of different ways, so we're going to hold off on our final judgement until next month. To reiterate, it does look really cool; lots of neat little abilities to discover and boss characters to vanquish.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.<br>
<strong>- Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.<br>
<strong>- Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.<br>
<strong>- Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.<br>
<strong>- Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atari is also cooking up a revival of <strong>Fatal Run</strong> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_run_2089">Fatal Run 2089</a>, a combat-focused racer due to launch on the Switch later this year. Digital Eclipse, a subsidiary of Atari, is working on the final touches to the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> on Switch and Switch 2, which looks absolutely awesome.</p>
