<p>The multiplayer component wasn't in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/company_of_heroes_collection">Company of Heroes Collection</a> when it arrived on the Switch in 2023, but it's now here.</p>
<p>After promising to add this in as a post-launch update, Feral Interactive has now patched in online "cross-platform multiplayer" in the latest game update. This will allow you to fight online in "up to four player online skirmishes". Here's the <a href="https://x.com/feralgames/status/1943249112641548782">announcement in full via social media</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Atten-shun! Online, cross-platform multiplayer has arrived for the Company of Heroes Collection on Nintendo Switch! Update today and take the fight online in up to four player online skirmishes. Battle your buddies across the world be they on Switch or mobile!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When Company of Heroes Collection originally launched on Switch, we mentioned how "incomplete" the game felt without multiplayer, so it's great to see the team has finally delivered it.</p>
<p>Feral Interactive also recently confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> is now playable on Switch 2 thanks to a recent system firmware update.</p>

<p>Hatsune Miku's puzzle and Picross-inspired title is getting a sequel officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hatsune_miku_logic_paint_splus">Hatsune Miku Logic Paint S+</a></strong>.

<p>"Rest in peace dear sweet man. I will miss you. The community will miss you. The world will miss you. One of the most joyful, exuberant, kind-hearted and talented souls no longer walks with us. James Carter Cathcart you were one of a kind, a gentle, beautiful, playful genius and I was happy to call you my friend.<br>
Master of the pen, piano and microphone. Friend to many. Loving father and husband. Thank you for your gifts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pokémon community has taken to social media to pay its respects with messages like the following one being shared to honour Cathcart's life and career:</p>

<p>Cathcart called time on his voice acting career in 2023 after he was diagnosed with throat cancer, but was still able to lend his voice to the original Pokémon series’ finale, which aired in the same year.</p>
<p>On behalf of the community here at Nintendo Life, we extend our deepest sympathies to James' family and friends.</p>
