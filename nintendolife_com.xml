It's the weekend once again, but before we dive into what we're playing, let's just do a quick recap of the last week.</p>
<p>First up, it seems only right that we go over some of the reviews we posted this week, because these include some pretty big games:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><br>

<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/agatha_christie_-_death_on_the_nile">Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile</a> - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile">8/10</a></p>
<p>Onto the news, and the bigg'un this week is the confirmation that Nintendo of America's President, Doug Bowser, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement">will be retiring at the end of the year</a>. Devon Pritchard will be taking over the role, while Satoru Shibata will join NoA as its CEO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> was announced for the Switch 2 and will include a brand new tale, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> confirmed an awesome <strong>Mega Man</strong> collaboration for its upcoming DLC.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, which was originally due to launch in early October, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">has been delayed to an unspecified date</a>. Not hugely surprising, and to be honest, there's so much coming out in the coming weeks, we'll be happy to wait for this one.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This week I finally finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, by which I mean I rolled credits after almost 30 hours with a 74% completion rate. I've since gone back, collected some more masks and grubs, and killed a couple of optional bosses bringing me up to 81%. I should really step away now - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> isn't going to play itself, and I've run out of things to spend Geo on. BUT! Beating the final trial in the Colosseum of Fools will get me another Pale Ore (I think?), and then I can upgrade my nail one more time, which would be neat. Can I resist seeing that percentage counter go up to 100 112?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I did start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which feels very Ubisoft, but not bad - I'm looking forward to playing more. However, payday arrived and I immediately ticked off one of my wishlist; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a> is now on my Switch 2. Despite lacking official S2 compatibility, I'm going to try it there and switch back to my OLED if I hit problems. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> this weekend and see if that resolution update has actually made a substantial difference. It really is a remarkable game, but man, does it look rough on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is also on the cards, and I'd also like to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst: Deluxe</a> if I can find the time. Oh, and I've also picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> on the PS5, so that'll be a pretty high priority for me.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I think I’m closing in on the first end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> and that’s good news. Not that I want it to end, I should stress, but my backlog from September alone is already looking at me with a hard stare, and I don’t want to picture what it’ll look like after <em>all the games</em> come out in October.</p>
<p>Between Silksong sessions, I’ve been plugging away at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> (also very, very good), and I recently picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> which, I hate to admit, I’ve never actually played. Oh yes, and I have Hades 2 locked and loaded for when I find a minute in-between all that.</p>
<p>So, a nice quiet one then!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Home stretch on Shinobi: Art of Vengeance with every level beckoning an endurance battle of skill, patience and some degree of sheer luck... a regular day for a ninja then. Being a complete sucker for mechs and SRPGS, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> and so far its a blast. It certainly was a long wait but Hades 2 is finally out of early access and a timed exclusive on Switch hardware. I’m a bit rusty but Melinoë certainly stands tall to Zagreus. I was not disciplined enough to have waited till November to pick up the physical edition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 19 of 50 games played. Golfaria is quite something!</p>
<p>Game of the week is (still) Star Wars Outlaws. With Kijimi complete, time to head for Akiva on the prowl for a droidsmith. I’m leaving Tatooine for last, looking forward to that.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm sticking with Hades 2 for the foreseeable future, mostly because I want to see <em>everything</em> this game has for me post-credits, but I also want to start afresh and run through the game proper. What a game. Supergiant is far too good to us.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm still fighting the urge to start a fresh save in Silksong. Thankfully we're away this weekend, so I don't think I'll be caving into my vices yet. Enjoy the weekend! Spooky season approaches!</p>

<p>There's a lot of new game footage on display at Tokyo Game Show this week, and on top of all the Square Enix game trailers, the company has now shared another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a>.</p>
<p>This game was announced earlier this month and will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 on 5th February 2026.</p>
<p>Now, at Japan's big gaming event, Square Enix has premiered roughly 17 minutes of live gameplay footage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@squareenix/streams">during its stage event</a>. The gameplay is featured between 27:43 - 44:39 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-17-minutes-of-tgs-2025-gameplay">thanks, Gematsu</a>), and while it's all in Japanese, there's still enough footage on display to get an idea of what you can expect.</p>

<p>If you didn't catch the news earlier this month, Square Enix has also confirmed there's no upgrade path available or planned for the Switch version. So you'll need to buy the title on Switch 2 if you want to play it on this system. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> (due out next month) also got a trailer yesterday showing off the new underwater region.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Square Enix has also shared roughly 18 minutes of gameplay footage of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> during the same stage event. This title is arriving for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025. You can see the gameplay on display between the 40:00 - 58:10 mark in the video below:</p>
