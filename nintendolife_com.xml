<p>Perhaps, most notably, the Switch 2 update will add "image quality and performance settings". Additionally, there is also a first-person perspective mode. Here's the translation from the official Falcom website (via Gematsu):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added “Image Quality / Performance Settings” to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</em></li>
<li><em>Added options to adjust text speed and text auto-advance speed.</em></li>
<li><em>Added one-key shortcuts for actions that normally require two key presses on keyboard.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a first-person mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Added the option to hide in-game user interface.</em></li>
<li><em>Corrected various text errors.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed other miscellaneous bugs.</em></li>
</ul><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gmxlvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p><em>*Updates for Nintendo Switch™ 2/Switch will be released at a later date.</em></p>
<p>To activate this first-person mode on the Switch 2 and Switch, you'll need to press R + ZL. And to hide the user interface, you'll need to press R + ZR.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it, here are the updates for Version 1.04:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added camera distance setting to options</em></li>
<li><em>Adjusted the Brave Attack input acceptance time in High Speed ​​Mode</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where some battles could become unprogressible.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could occur when jumping between maps.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could occur when operating the Orbment menu.</em></li>
<li><em>Corrected typos and omissions</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed other bugs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In our review here on Nintendo Life, we mentioned how there were some "slight performance issues" in the Switch 2 version. Here's part of what we had to say about this particular version of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The journey of our sibling Bracers is most impressive on Switch 2, which targets 60fps...Undocked is notably the best mode and runs with what feels like flawless stability in combat and wandering the open world. Docked is also strong, but there is the odd frame hiccup in population centres and during visually busy battles. The game isn’t a visual powerhouse by any means, but it’s nice to see the characters adventure through lovingly designed environments without any compromises on the newer console."</p>

<p>The playtest was extended to Switch 2 in July</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="54d885022693f"><a title="Switch Online Playtest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54d885022693f/switch-online-playtest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Another patent has been published for the Switch Online Playtest Program, which was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-switch-online-playtest-program-returns-includes-switch-2-support">extended to Switch 2 users</a> in July.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3m2rzkc4lx22b">Nintendo Patents Watch on Bluesky</a>, the patent was originally filed in Japan in April last year and in the US in April 2025. The latest one was published in the US this week and reportedly describes a system in which the player can "intuitively select multiple objects in a virtual space by walking around them".</p>
<p>Here's the official abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A player character is caused to move in a three-dimensional virtual space according to a first operation input. In the three-dimensional virtual space, a first object that connects a reference point set at a position according to a second operation input, and the player character is generated. A shape of the first object is changed based on movement of the player character. Whena second object is surrounded by the first object in the three-dimensional virtual space, the second object is designated for further game processing."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gmxlvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>As highlighted by the same source, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205e.pdf">mentioned earlier this year</a> how the playtest was "related to a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service", but did not elaborate on this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We plan to leverage results and other learnings gained from this intiative in future Nintendo Switch Online services, but we have not announced any details".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although details and footage about the first playtest were leaked online, Nintendo kept the same requests in place for the second playtest - asking participants to not "discuss or disclose content" about the program with others.</p>

<p>If you saw the post-credits scene in the original movie, this probably shouldn't come as a surprise. The first movie starred Jack Black as Steve, who was joined by Jason Momoa and a crew of misfits, tasked with saving the Overworld from the Piglin invasion.</p>
<p>A promotional shot has also been shared alongside this announcement, which shows two pickaxe with a purple glow. This has already led to speculation about <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_End_(biome)">The End biome</a>, and everything related to it.

<p>When the first film made its debut in cinemas earlier this year, it was positively received and ended up becoming a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-box-office-success-1236362729/">major box office success</a>. While it's admittedly no cinematic masterpiece, this comedic live-action fantasy adventure does a great job <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/video-minecraft-movie-exclusive-insight-shows-off-the-live-action-crafting-table">recreating the world of Minecraft</a> with all sorts of lore and references to the hugely popular crafting and survival video game.</p>
<p>Mojang even released some free DLC and as well as an in-game event inspired by various "iconic scenes" from the movie.</p>
