<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9013bbde981f0/hyrule-warriors.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Koei Tecmo unveiled its new Musou game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> earlier this year for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how development is tracking, the latest update is the Switch 2 title has just been rated by the classification board in Brazil.</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-now-been-rated-in-brazil/">Universo Nintendo (via My Nintendo News)</a>, with the outlet suggesting an update about this game could be coming very soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game here was rated "over 12 years old", despite Nintendo's request that it be classified as "over 10"."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> was rated 'T' for 'Teen' and contained fantasy violence along with in-game purchases.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, this follow-up is scheduled to arrive "this winter" although some official online pages currently list 'TBD'.</p>
<p>As previously revealed, this game will take place <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and is set to feature the classic 'Warriors' gameplay. Here's a bit extra about it from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></strong> is the newest title in the Hyrule Warriors series and is developed by Koei-Tecmo Games with support from Nintendo. The game features epic battles against hordes of enemies as it tells the untold story from Hyrule's distant past of the Imprisoning War that ultimately led to the events of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em><em>. Fans of the Legend of Zelda series and players of both</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda:</em> <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> can experience the thrill of battle and this canonical tale featuring Princess Zelda, King Rauru, and other familiar characters. Fight for Hyrule’s future when <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> comes to Nintendo Switch 2 this winter."</p>

<p>The reviews are now rolling in, and so we've put together this round up. If you're still not sure whether or not to upgrade your existing copy, or if it's worth finally taking a look at the latest entry, this might help you decide. So, first up, our review – we gave this upgraded package an "excellent" <strong>9/10</strong> stars:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mnslwt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV gives an already fantastic party game a huge shot in the arm, with a bunch of brilliant Mouse Mode and mic-based games that also allow you to see your big silly face as you play. It's all very knockabout, very easy to use, and very easy to enjoy."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184958 @ 1753349798 -->
<p>What did other outlets have to say then? Starting the party with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">IGN</a>, this outlet awarded the Switch 2 package <strong>7/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still fantastic, but the mixed new content of the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV re-release adds frustrating limitations and strange design decisions to what was otherwise a polished, customizable experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-party-jamboree-switch-2/">VGC</a> gave it <strong>4/5</strong> stars, noting how this upgrade elevates what's already one of the best series entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By itself, then, Jamboree TV is a bit of an uneven expansion. However, Switch 2 does power some genuinely great new mini-games and, when it works (and if you own one), camera support does elevate the general experience, making this almost by default the definitive version of one of the best Mario Party games. Whether that’s worth the $20 / £17 upgrade, however, is very much dependent on your personal affection for the series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition">Polygon</a> labelled it the Switch 2's best tech demo yet, even though it labelled the upgrade as "falling on the inessential side":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The upgrade winds up falling on the inessential side – especially since it misses a chance to add some new maps or characters – but the full package is one of the Switch 2’s smartest value propositions at present. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> now stands as a robust party game that makes up for its shortcomings in sheer variety."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Vooks</a> scored it <strong>3/5</strong> stars, describing it as one for "superfans":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mario Party superfans will enjoy the new modes for the main board games, but the Jamboree TV additions—aside from the mouse games—are a bit average. <em>Jamboree</em> was a solid and complete package, and this just splits it all up and breaks the flow."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-is-perfectly-fine/">Siliconera</a> said this update was "perfectly fine", awarding it <strong>8/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Super</em> <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> remains a solid game... <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em> is a natural pick-up for families. If someone is in a home with multiple players who own both Switch or Switch 2 systems, it could be great for game nights. However, if you’re going to go with one Switch or Switch 2 system for a group session or plan to play only online... you might be fine sticking with the original game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV launches this week on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>
