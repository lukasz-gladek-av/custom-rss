<figure data-uuid="d921e7ed47594"><a title="Requiem / Hamilton 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d921e7ed47594/requiem-hamilton-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom / Hamilton</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're really, really excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> next month, then you might want to keep an eye out for two limited edition watches from manufacturer Hamilton.</p>
<p>Launching alongside the game on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, the two models are featured in the game itself and are (conveniently) worn by both protagonists: Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. They also cost enough to make RE4's merchant break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The models in question are:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Classic Pan Europ - £1,170</li>
<li>Khaki Field Auto Chrono - £1,800</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for more information over on the official <a href="https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-gb/resident-evil-requiem">Hamilton website</a> right now. Regardless of price, these things will likely disappear pretty quickly, so if you're genuinely interested, then definitely head on over there ASAP.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zombies-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-but-now-theyre-more-terrifying-than-ever">Resident Evil Showcase</a> revealed a bunch more information about Requiem, including key gameplay mechanics for both Leon and Grace. It'll launch day one on Switch 2 alongside both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard Gold Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</a>.</p>

Not only that, but we've also received official confirmation that zombies are back. But they're slightly different this time...</p>
<p>The zombies here are not completely mindless, but rather retain some of the attributes of their personalities when they were alive. This means you'll see zombies attempting to complete tasks like cleaning the environment, albeit in a completely deranged manner.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The showcase explains that careful observation of your enemies will allow you to either sneak around them or get the drop on them. If you're playing as Leon, you'll be able to parry attacks with a hatchet and execute brutal finishing moves while also picking up weapons dropped by the zombies. And yes, this includes a chainsaw. Grace's gameplay, meanwhile, is more akin to classic survival horror, placing emphasis on limited ammo.</p>
<p>Crafting also makes a return, and you'll actually need to extract blood from your fallen enemies to create specialised injectors. The description for one of these says "Prevents corpses from mutating", so it seems reasonable to assume that we might see some enemies similar to the Crimson Heads from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> remake.</p>
<p>The showcase also revealed three default difficulty levels for Requiem. Casual will add in auto-aiming to allow newcomers to ease into the experience, while Standard comes in both Modern and Classic forms. The latter brings back the Ink Ribbon items during Grace's gameplay, meaning your ability to save is finite. It's likely that a more difficult 'Hardcore' option will be available upon completion of the main game, but this wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p>It was also reiterated that you can change between first and third-person perspectives at any time during gameplay. Meanwhile, a Requiem Pro Controller will launch for the Switch 2 alongside the game next month, while amiibo will also arrive later in the year.</p>

<p>"Forever fast"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Believe it or not, <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> is celebrating his 35th anniversary in 2026, and Sega is clearly planning something as it dropped a nostalgia blast of a trailer celebrating the blue blur's life and times.</p>
<p>The trailer highlights the range of Sonic over the franchise's storied history, from his pixel perfect start on the Mega Drive with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, to blockbuster movies in Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy.</p>
<p>He's done everything you can think of — LEGO Sonic, the animated series <strong>Sonic X</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, and obviously tons and tons of his own video games. So 2026 should be a big year for Sega and Sonic.</p>
<p>"For over three decades, Sonic has raced through generations and inspired fans with his unmatched speed, unstoppable energy and fearless spirit" Sega says on the <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog?tab=35th-anniversary">newly-opened 35th anniversary website</a>. "Now, it’s time to honor his incredible journey and celebrate the blue blur’s countless adventures."</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega / Atlus' brand marketing vice president Marcella Churchill shared in a press release that “This milestone is not just a reflection of our past, but also a look toward the future as we continue to innovate and grow."</p>
<p>Sega will be revealing partnerships, collectibles, fan experiences, and more throughout the year. We hope there might be a game announcement in there, too.</p>
<p>21st June 2026 will be the official day of Sonic's 35th anniversary, but we're sure we'll hear a lot about Sega's iconic character over the coming months.</p>
