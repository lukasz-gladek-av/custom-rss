<p>A climactic battle awaits</p>

<figure data-uuid="cf9fa91b7c2eb"><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf9fa91b7c2eb/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, LEGO</em></figcaption></figure><p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-new-zelda-lego-set-rumour-links-it-to-fan-favourite-entry">after some rumours</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-teases-a-new-lego-legend-of-zelda-set-possibly-including-ganon">teased a new Legend of Zelda-themed Lego set</a> coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Now that we're in the new year, it seems this set might have actually leaked ahead of the official reveal. As previous rumours suggested, it appears to be a diorama based on the final battle between Link, Zelda and Ganondorf in the N64 hit, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>According to this latest scoop (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/">via r/Legoleak</a>), it's officially titled '77093 The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time' and will contain 1003 pieces and the three Minifigs. Additionally, Zelda fans will also apparently get Navi the Fairy, a "brick-built" version of Ganon, the Megaton Hammer and some recovery hearts.</p>
<p>It's supposedly priced at $129.99 and will be launching on 1st March 2026. Here's the "first" proper look:</p>

<p>This set would follow on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-2-in-1-a-superb-debut-with-one-minor-irritation">Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set</a>, which arrived in 2024 for $299.99 and contained 2500 pieces. 2026 also happens to be the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> series, so plenty of announcements are expected.</p>

<p>Including updates to resolution and load times</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo officially launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on the Switch 2 this week, and since then, some video comparisons have now popped up online.</p>
<p>One of these has been shared by the <a href="https://youtu.be/MUO1BRWZ8wQ">YouTube channel 'ElAnalistaDeBits'</a>, which not only presents a side-by-side visual comparison of the Switch 2 Edition next to the existing Switch release, but also shows other improvements such as game's loading times.</p>
<p>As Nintendo has previously noted, the Switch 2 Edition is "4K" in docked mode. As for handheld, it's 1080p (so everything looks sharper), and both versions of the game run at a consistent 30fps. There's also a demonstration of the improved load times. Similar to the resolution bump, you may or may not notice the difference when you're actually playing the game.</p>
<p>In this particular video demo, you can see in one example on Switch 2 how it takes eight seconds to get from the title screen to the game, while the Switch version takes around 17 seconds. And in another test, loading from the system HOME Menu to actual gameplay takes 16 seconds on the Switch 2 and about 30 seconds on the original system.</p>
<p>We've also shared our thoughts about the Switch 2 version's resolution, frame rate and loading times, so if you haven't already read our review, be sure to check it out. Nintendo previously highlighted the Switch 2 Edition's "enhanced resolution" in the announcement trailer. You can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update#animal-crossing-new-horizons-all-switch-2-features">see this side-by-side comparison</a> in our full guide.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/raising-my-daddy-rank-at-a-london-gyoza-bar</link>
            <guid>1407856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="504b9ee386419"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/504b9ee386419/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>My gaming life can now be cleanly split into two sections: the period before I had heard the phrase "Daddy Rank", and the period after it.</p>
<p>It's one of the key features of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> that Sega was kind enough to show me at a fancy gyoza-joint-turned-preview space in London this week, and in the days since, I haven't stopped muttering it to myself whenever I do a small piece of housework.</p>
<p>Kiryu's Daddy Rank is the bread and butter of Kiwami 3's new 'Life at Morning Glory' side content — an expansion on the 2009 original's opening locale, where the ex-Tojo Clan tough guy swaps his knuckledusters for a pair of marigolds and cracks on with some chores around his self-made orphanage.</p>
<p>Yakuza is a series renowned for its constant flip-flopping between serious and silly, dark and delightful, and it always plays best to me when it leans into the latter of the two camps and embraces the brooding protagonist's softer side. Life at Morning Glory is about exactly that.</p>
<h2>What's the story, Morning Glory?</h2>
<p>The children need help with a series of tasks, and it's up to the Daddy of Dojima (as I will now <em>insist</em> on calling him) to come to the rescue.</p>
<p>In my preview, I sped through a multiple-choice questionnaire to assist young Ayako with her science homework, followed the lines of a sewing minigame to knock up a new dustcloth for Taichi, farmed and planted crops in the garden, then chopped, mixed, and scum-skimmed them into a curry for Koji's dinner.</p>

<p>At the end of each task, Kiryu holds up his handiwork (a test paper/piece of fabric/steaming plate) and smiles directly into the camera in much the same way that your avatar might in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> after catching a fish. In the game world, this is all a process of improving Kiryu's bond with each child and working out where he stands as a father figure; in the real world, it's a chance to play some super sweet minigames, then smile as a big green Daddy Rank bar ticks up the screen with each success.</p>
<p>The preview was hosted entirely on PS5, but I can't wait to take this silly little side mission on the go with me on Switch 2. It's just a taxi ride away from the open streets of Ryukyu and Kamurocho, too, so you just know that I'm going to be putting off all the brutal murders, clan wars, and shady deals to beat my stitching record back on the beaches of Okinawa.</p>
<h2>From Daddy to Baddy</h2>
<p>While I'm on the open streets, let's touch on some Baddie Battles. No, much like Daddy Rank, I'm not making this up. In another of Kiwami 3's fresh storylines, Kiryu becomes the surprise chairman of the Haisai Girls, an all-female biker gang that's engaged in a turf war with the larger-than-life Tokyo Night Terrors.</p>
<p>A lot of this 'Bad Boy Dragon' gameplay circulates around massive squad battles between the two teams, where you can put either Kiryu's classic Dragon of Dojima fighting style or the snappy new weapon-focused Ryukyu style to the test. It's also about team management. You can save people in peril on the streets of Okinawa and recruit them to your biker squad, each bringing their own skills to the baddie lineup — be that powerful attacks, rallying cries or healing abilities. Then, before diving into a head-to-head against another clan, you choose which characters will make up your squad, balancing their quirks to suit the situation.</p>

<p>In short, it's the crew recruitment system from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_pirate_yakuza_in_hawaii">Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> transposed onto a biker gang, but that's no bad thing! I was informed that you can also customise Kiryu and his crew with snazzy uniforms, bike designs and banners, but I never got to see these tools in the preview — which is probably for the best, because I can guarantee that it would have gobbled up <em>all my time</em>.</p>
<p>When I wasn't recruiting baddies, the streets of Downtown Ryukyu were expectedly packed with distractions — karaoke, arcades, golf, bowling, you know the drill. There's also side missions galore, bounties to be hunted, and the chance to head back over to Morning Glory and stay on top of that aforementioned Daddy Rank. I'm not obsessed, I promise.</p>
<p>It all looks and plays wonderfully on PS5, and given how impressed I've been by the three Yakuza titles available on Switch 2 already (gosh, Sega really has been churning them out, huh?), I'd be surprised if this entry is any different. Yakuza 3 is often viewed as one of the lesser titles in the series, so seeing the whole affair brought to RGG's slick Dragon Engine with some nips, tucks, and new fighting styles, pushes this one excitingly close to the territory of being an entirely new game rather than a standard remake.</p>
<h2>Tying things up</h2>
<p>Oh yes, speaking of an "entirely new game", I should probably touch on Dark Ties, too. This came right at the end of my preview, and I've left it to the end here, too, because it felt like the addition I already knew the most about. Sega has been showcasing this prologue story starring the base game's antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, for a good few months now (our sister site, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/its-mines-time-to-shine-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Push Square</a>, went hands-on with it back in September), and, shockingly, it feels like more Yakuza.</p>
<p>Mine's athletic moveset is a lot of fun — a special attack that lets you jump kick off one opponent's chest, flinging yourself into an aerial attack on another, is a particular highlight — and the underground Hell's Arena fight club gave me a good chance to see it in action.</p>

<p>Other than that, it was business as usual on the streets of Kamurocho. The Kanda Damage Control side content peppered the open world with tasks for me to complete and up my 'Kanda Rank' in the process (it's all 'Ranks' in this game) by improving Tsuyoshi Kanda's street cred, but it all felt very Yakuza-y otherwise. This is no criticism, mind you; it's always great to have more hot content to dive into.</p>
<p>I left the preview with a belly full of gyoza and the words 'Daddy Rank' still playing on my mind. From what I've seen, this feels like the biggest step up for a 'Kiwami' remake so far, packed with new content, combat styles, and with an entirely new story bolted onto the side.</p>
<p>Does it all still feel a little overwhelming? Of course it does! But come on, we wouldn't have Yakuza any other way.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d921e7ed47594"><a title="Requiem / Hamilton 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d921e7ed47594/requiem-hamilton-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom / Hamilton</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're really, really excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> next month, then you might want to keep an eye out for two limited edition watches from manufacturer Hamilton.</p>
<p>Launching alongside the game on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, the two models are featured in the game itself and are (conveniently) worn by both protagonists: Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. They also cost enough to make RE4's merchant break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The models in question are:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Classic Pan Europ - £1,170</li>
<li>Khaki Field Auto Chrono - £1,800</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for more information over on the official <a href="https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-gb/resident-evil-requiem">Hamilton website</a> right now. Regardless of price, these things will likely disappear pretty quickly, so if you're genuinely interested, then definitely head on over there ASAP.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zombies-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-but-now-theyre-more-terrifying-than-ever">Resident Evil Showcase</a> revealed a bunch more information about Requiem, including key gameplay mechanics for both Leon and Grace. It'll launch day one on Switch 2 alongside both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard Gold Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</a>.</p>

<p>Ink Ribbons are also back</p>

<figure data-uuid="802f6efa1a1c4"><a title="RE Zombie 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/802f6efa1a1c4/re-zombie-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9HIc7GZLa0&amp;rco=1">The Resident Evil Showcase</a> has revealed extensive gameplay for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, launching on <strong>27th February, 2026</strong>. Not only that, but we've also received official confirmation that zombies are back. But they're slightly different this time...</p>
<p>The zombies here are not completely mindless, but rather retain some of the attributes of their personalities when they were alive. This means you'll see zombies attempting to complete tasks like cleaning the environment, albeit in a completely deranged manner.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The showcase explains that careful observation of your enemies will allow you to either sneak around them or get the drop on them. If you're playing as Leon, you'll be able to parry attacks with a hatchet and execute brutal finishing moves while also picking up weapons dropped by the zombies. And yes, this includes a chainsaw. Grace's gameplay, meanwhile, is more akin to classic survival horror, placing emphasis on limited ammo.</p>
<p>Crafting also makes a return, and you'll actually need to extract blood from your fallen enemies to create specialised injectors. The description for one of these says "Prevents corpses from mutating", so it seems reasonable to assume that we might see some enemies similar to the Crimson Heads from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> remake.</p>
<p>The showcase also revealed three default difficulty levels for Requiem. Casual will add in auto-aiming to allow newcomers to ease into the experience, while Standard comes in both Modern and Classic forms. The latter brings back the Ink Ribbon items during Grace's gameplay, meaning your ability to save is finite. It's likely that a more difficult 'Hardcore' option will be available upon completion of the main game, but this wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p>It was also reiterated that you can change between first and third-person perspectives at any time during gameplay. Meanwhile, a Requiem Pro Controller will launch for the Switch 2 alongside the game next month, while amiibo will also arrive later in the year.</p>
