<p>Things that make you go Vroom</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We reported a little while back on Switch 2 timed-exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gear-club-unlimited-3">Gear.Club Unlimited 3</a>, and how it was delayed from an initial release date in 2025 to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gear-club-unlimited-3-speeds-onto-switch-2-later-this-year">sometime in 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Nacon and Eden Games have announced pre-orders for the delayed racer for Switch 2, with a release date of <strong>19th February</strong> next year. Hooray and/or VROOOOOM!</p>
<p>According to Nacon, "this new instalment promises a more immersive experience than ever before, powered by the new console and enhanced with two completely new regions."</p>
<div><p>It's also the first Japan-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gear_club_unlimited">Gear.Club</a>, with players invited to recruit the best local drivers, assemble teams and immerse themselves in the country's unique automotive culture. The Story mode, "will be punctuated by trips back and forth between France and Japan, highlighting the shared passion that unites car enthusiasts on both continents."</p><p>

This third entry also introduces a new Highway Mode, which promises "unprecedented thrills", like that one time this writer got on his bicycle and rode at speed with no trousers. Speaking of trousers, you'll need some, as Highway mode sees you challenged with perfecting furiously fast sections of urban raceway at speeds "over 300 km/h through the dense traffic of Japanese highways." (That's 186mph+, imperial folks.)</p><p>

The game is available in two flavours, standard and deluxe, with the latter giving three days early access, a “Performance Cars Pack” DLC, and there's also a “Career Starter Pack” and “Customization Pack” thrown in for this version. Pre-orders of either version will come with the Honda and BMW in the pic below:</p></div>

<p>Here's a little more detail and some pics from the press kit for all you motorheads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>True to its DNA, Gear.Club Unlimited 3 retains the elements that made the series so successful:</strong></p>
<p>Prestige: a selection of legendary vehicles under official licenses;</p>
<p>Customization: players can customize and upgrade their vehicles to their liking to impose their style on the roads;</p>
<p>Adrenaline: more than 50 tracks in France and Japan, with a local split-screen multiplayer mode for 2 players. Players can compete in races, sprints, or duels, but also cooperate in highway mode for an even more intense shared experience!</p>
</blockquote>


<p>All that said, try as we might, we can't find pre-orders live beyond the Standard Edition pages retailers have had for some time. It's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gear-Club-Unlimited-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0G162MLJD?tag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">£44.99 on Amazon</a> at the moment, but there's no sign of the fancy-pants Deluxe version at the time of writing, nor word on the price, and nothing on the eShop. We'll update this when we find out more.</p>

<p>With physical versions and everything!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>ININ Games has just announced that a new entry in the iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_r-type">R-Type</a> series is on its way to Switch consoles in May 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a> sees players return to the franchise's signature side-scrolling bullet hell warfare against, well, a whole bunch of weird s**t, sir. It's coming right at us!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. Flashbacks, innit. Working closely with Tozai and Irem (so that's the original creators and licence holders onboard), ININ describes this one as "one of the most ambitious and significant undertakings in ININ’s history." So stick that in your pulsating xenomorph skull and smoke it.</p>
<p>Building on the legacy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/r-type_dimensions_ex">R-Type Dimensions EX</a>, this new game apparently completely re-envisions the core action with cutting-edge visuals, sounds and more in the way of gameplay modes.</p>
<p>Here's some more details from ININ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> brings the intensity, precision, and creative enemy design of the arcade originals to a new generation. Every stage, boss, and projectile pattern has been rebuilt with high-end 3D graphics, enhanced animations, and richly detailed environments, whilst preserving the instantly recognizable atmosphere that defined R-Type’s identity.</p>
<p>The same applies to the original music and sound effects. With an enormous effort, everything has been rebuilt so that Players can switch seamlessly between the original and the new R-Type III at any time, offering both nostalgic authenticity and a striking modern reinterpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Key features include:</strong></p>
<p>A fully remastered experience with completely reconstructed assets</p>
<p>Local co-op, enhanced with new scoring and survival mechanics</p>
<p>Advanced mode is accessible from the start</p>
<p>Customizable controls and quality-of-life features in the settings</p>
<p>3D Camera settings (normal and crazy)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we mentioned, there are also physical editions to get hold of here, with a special and collector's version as detailed below!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Special Edition<br></strong>The Special Edition includes the full game, a beautifully crafted artbook showcasing concept art and visual development, as well as the complete new original soundtrack, perfect for players who want to dive deeper into the creative universe of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>. This edition will be sold for € 59,99.</p>
<p><strong>Collector’s Edition<br></strong>For devoted R-Type enthusiasts, the ultra-limited Collector’s Edition offers everything from the Special Edition plus a selection of exclusive bonus items. The centerpiece is a highly collectible figurine based on the new cover interpretation. This exclusive edition is priced at € 199,99.</p>
