<p>It's also on the way to the Switch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/azure-striker-gunvolt-trilogy-enhanced-announced-for-switch">Azure Gunvolt Trilogy Enhanced</a></strong> getting confirmed for a worldwide release yesterday, Inti Creates has now lifted the lid on its 30th anniversary project <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/majogami">Majogami</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>30th October 2025</strong> and is described as a new paper craft "2D action experience". You can see the official premiere in the video above, and below this is some PR to go with it.</p>
<p>The game stars a young woman named Shiroha who must cut through the horrors of a bizarre world after her father is turned into paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paper craft character action. Majogami stars Shiroha, a young woman who has lost her memory, who travels alongside Shiori, her father who has been turned to paper. With her katana, "Kamikiri", in hand, she travels through a bizarre world and cuts through the horrors she finds there in this 2D character action platformer.</p>
<p>Players take control of Shiroha who can move and attack instantly with her "Setsuna" ability, taking out enemies without missing a beat.</p>
<p>Along her journey, Shiroha will collect cards imbued with her memories called Recarte, and face off against the diverse Majogami, divine "Craft Witches" who control the world. These Majogami, with twisted hearts and powerful magic, stand in Shiroha's way as she tries to escape their domain. In addition to her Setsuna attack, she can rely on Shiori's defense sigils and the power of the guardians she meets, the Astrals, to transform herself into new fighting forms.<br>
By defeating these Majogami, Shiroha can slowly regain her memories of both her and Shiori's life, deepening their bonds and revealing her story.</p>
<p>Experience the touching family story and see Shiroha's determination to make it through this twisted world to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title will be available digitally on the Switch 2 for <strong>$39.99 USD</strong> (or the regional equivalent), or you can grab it on the Switch for <strong>$34.99</strong>. A physical release has also been confirmed for Japan. Here's a look at the box art design:</p>

<p>The multiplayer component wasn't in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/company_of_heroes_collection">Company of Heroes Collection</a> when it arrived on the Switch in 2023, but it's now here.</p>
<p>After promising to add this in as a post-launch update, Feral Interactive has now patched in online "cross-platform multiplayer" in the latest game update. This will allow you to fight online in "up to four player online skirmishes". Here's the <a href="https://x.com/feralgames/status/1943249112641548782">announcement in full via social media</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Atten-shun! Online, cross-platform multiplayer has arrived for the Company of Heroes Collection on Nintendo Switch! Update today and take the fight online in up to four player online skirmishes. Battle your buddies across the world be they on Switch or mobile!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When Company of Heroes Collection originally launched on Switch, we mentioned how "incomplete" the game felt without multiplayer, so it's great to see the team has finally delivered it.</p>
<p>Feral Interactive also recently confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> is now playable on Switch 2 thanks to a recent system firmware update.</p>

<p>He voiced multiple iconic characters</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="PokÃ©mon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/85dda83b216f8/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The PokÃ©mon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>PokÃ©mon fans and the voice acting community are this week mourning the loss of James Carter Cathcart, who has passed away at the age of 71.</p>
<p>Cathcart was known for not only voicing characters like Gary Oak, but also Professor Oak and Team Rocket's James and Meowth later in his career. He also worked on other series like Yu-Gi-Oh! (Weevil Underwood) and Sonic the Hedgehog (Vector).</p>
<p>Voice actor Erica Schroeder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7dvZ8OAmN/?igsh=MWR6MHU0c2c4eXAxNQ%3D%3D">confirmed his passing on social media</a>, noting how he was "one of the most joyful, exuberant, kind-hearted and talented souls" and a master of the "pen, piano and microphone".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rest in peace dear sweet man. I will miss you. The community will miss you. The world will miss you. One of the most joyful, exuberant, kind-hearted and talented souls no longer walks with us. James Carter Cathcart you were one of a kind, a gentle, beautiful, playful genius and I was happy to call you my friend.<br>
Master of the pen, piano and microphone. Friend to many. Loving father and husband. Thank you for your gifts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PokÃ©mon community has taken to social media to pay its respects with messages like the following being shared to honour Cathcart's life and career:</p>


<p>Cathcart called time on his voice acting career in 2023 after he was diagnosed with throat cancer, but was still able to lend his voice to the original PokÃ©mon seriesâ€™ finale, which aired in the same year.</p>
<p>On behalf of the community here at Nintendo Life, we extend our deepest sympathies to James' family and friends.</p>
