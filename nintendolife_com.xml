The publisher and distributor announced the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2673080/view/491590284956666227?l=english">Steam</a> (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mema6bshls25">Wario64</a>) earlier today.</p>
<p>From <strong>31st March 2026</strong>, you'll no longer be able to purchase the game digitally. However, if you already own it (physically or digitally) or buy it before 31st March, you'll be able to redownload and play it at any point.</p>
<p>No reason for the delisting was given, but it's likely due to licensing rights expiring, similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bill_and_teds_excellent_retro_collection">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/bill-and-teds-excellent-retro-collection-is-about-to-be-delisted-on-the-switch-eshop">a few years back</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067onhvlt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's Limited Run Games' statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to give you an early heads-up that the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection will no longer be available for purchase on digital storefronts after March 31, 2026.</p>
<p>If you already purchased the game, don’t worry — you’ll still be able to redownload and play it anytime.</p>
<p>In the past, we learned how important it is to provide plenty of notice for changes like this, so we’re committed to being as open and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>Our goal is to give fans every opportunity to grab the game before it’s too late. Thanks for understanding!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jurassic Park: Classic Games Collection came to Switch on 22nd November 2023, so by the time it gets removed from the eShop, it'll have only been out for around two years and four months. The games included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurassic Park (NES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the Collection perhaps <em>isn't</em> the best showing for the iconic dinosaur franchise, but it's a time capsule of 8 - and 16-bit games made in the wake of the 1993 movie's huge success. We acknowledged this as much in our review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/jurassic-park-classic-games-collection">scoring the selection a 6/10</a>.</p>

And, according to Takuto Edagawa, the game's director, it sounds like we'll be spending a <em>lot</em> of time rebuilding this abandoned island with our Pokémon.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">IGN</a>, Edagawa — who works at Koei Tecmo and previously worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> and directed the <strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts</a> — said that the main aim of the game "is typically not to go to the end roll", meaning the credits.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fprtkiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it'll be about <strong>20 to 40 hours</strong>, but it would really depend on how the players play the game", he told the outlet.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like a pretty chunky game, even if you just focus on the main stuff. And for reference, the Dragon Quest Builders games, which Pokopia seems to be closely-aligned with, are a little longer at 40-50+ hours.</p>
<p>And, as you probably expect from a game like Pokopia, there's a <em>lot</em> more to do than just "roll credits", which Edagawa confirms: "There's more things to experience after the end roll... I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game."</p>

<p>Unsurprising stuff, but that confirms we'll be booking out our March to sit down and thoroughly dedicate ourselves to island rebuilding and repopulating.</p>
<p>When our very own Ollie Reynolds got to play Pokopia, he came away extremely surprised and impressed, and for cosy gamers, he had this to say: "I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p>
