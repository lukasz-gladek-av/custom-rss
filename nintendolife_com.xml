<p>The "superhero comedy" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> got announced for the Switch and Switch 2 this week, and following the initial reveal, <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Dispatch-Comes-to-Nintendo-Switch-1-and-2-on-January-28#:~:text=A%20free%20update%20will%20be,720p%20on%20the%20original%20console.">we've now got some details</a> about the game's performance.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version (which is a free upgrade for anyone who has the game on Switch) will offer "enhanced performance" of up to 60fps with 1440p resolution. And on the original Switch, players can expect 30fps and 720p resolution.</p>
<p>Exact frame rate and resolution differences between the portable and docked modes haven't been revealed.</p>
<p>Once again, when Dispatch launches on both of these platforms on <strong>28th January 2026</strong>, it will set you back <strong>$29.99</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>). Between now and the release date, you can also get a 10% discount on this price, bringing the total cost down to $26.99.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this upcoming release in our previous post here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>The good news is the fifth chapter is "really moving along" now. In saying this, the official release date could still be "several months" out. Fox also expects the team to be focused Chapter 6 in just "a few months":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> "If I had to give a realistic estimate, I believe that it will take several months to release the game from where we are now.</p>
<p>"It feels crazy to say this even though only 6 months ago you guys only had Chapters 1 and 2, but in a few months, much of the team will probably already be focusing their attention on Chapter 6..."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="htp-VfCtJow" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythtp-VfCtJow" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c7531yquxkr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As for the current progress, work on localisation has just begun. And around January, the plan is to start investigating how the fifth chapter will operate on consoles.</p>
<p>Fox has also shared a few more details – noting how all the rooms in this chapter "are more or less done". Along with this, almost all the scenes in the chapter are complete, and most of the battles are also done. Players can look forward to "hours of fun" when it eventually arrives.</p>
<p>One last thing is Deltarune will be getting a sale this holiday season. It'll be 20% off on Steam, and this deal will apparently follow on console platforms "in the coming days".</p>
