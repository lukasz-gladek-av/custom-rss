<p>"A brand new, original story-led adventure"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bluey, the popular Australian animation for children, is <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/blog/blueys-quest-for-the-gold-pen-video-game-arrives-december/">getting a new video game</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p>It's officially titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/blueys-quest-for-the-gold-pen">Bluey's Quest for the Gold Pen</a> and is an "original story-led adventure game" by the show's creator Joe Brumm. Halfbrick – the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/fruit_ninja">Fruit Ninja</a> studio based in Bluey's hometown of Brisbane – will be bringing this title to Nintendo platforms and other systems in partnership with PM Studios.</p>
<p>This new game, "inspired by the hand-drawn worlds of the Dragon and Escape episodes" invites players to unlock Bluey's drawings, which are brought to real life by the Heeler family. It blends "heartfelt storytelling with discovery-driven gameplay".</p>
<p>All up, there'll be nine adventure-filled levels to work through - from snowy mountains, golden beaches, to lush green forests and even the Aussie outback. Along the way, players can uncover treasures, solve puzzles, and embark on magical mini quests as they "glide, fly, and skate" through the world.</p>
<p>The initial launch for Apple devices is taking place this December, with the console and PC release to follow next year.</p>

<p>If you haven't already checked out our review of Hades 2, here's a quick sample. On Switch 2, we gave the game an excellent nine out of ten. We also shared our impressions of the title on the original Switch version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Supergiant Games is five-for-five with Hades II, a huge, triumphant sequel that manages to diverge mechanically and offer more challenges and variety than its predecessor. It helps that it’s nearly faultless on Switch 2 in particular."</p>

<p>So many games nowadays come loaded with DLC, or at least plans for some other paid content drop in the future, but when it comes to the upcoming Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, you'll be getting the full package on release.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the latest Nintendo Direct broadcast, the game's director Masahiro Sakurai mentioned how the Kirby Air Riders team isn't currently planning on any DLC, and "everything is here". Additionally, he's not planning to turn this into an "ongoing series".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just so you know: We're not planning any DLC. Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start.

<p>So, no DLC is in the pipeline, and don't expect this racing entry to necessarily transform into an ongoing series or anything similar. Of course, there will be some additional physical content in the form of a new amiibo line, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/three-more-kirby-air-riders-amiibo-have-been-announced">multiple figures already announced</a>.</p>
<p>You can find out more about these amiibo and the latest Kirby Air Riders Direct in our full guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>
