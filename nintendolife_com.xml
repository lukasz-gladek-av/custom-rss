<figure data-uuid="3c6d69b342a2a"><a title="Mario Galaxy Star" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c6d69b342a2a/mario-galaxy-star.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are mere days away from the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on Switch (at least, the second one has been long-awaited). The new bundle arrives on <strong>2nd October</strong>, and the reviews have started rolling in.</p>
<p>Our very own Ollie Reynolds put virtual pen to virtual paper for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2">our review</a> and, surprise surprise, he still had a wonderful time with this pair of classics. Mr Reynolds awarded the galactic return an excellent 9/10 and enjoyed just about everything they threw at him. Here's a snippet of the review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188104 @ 1759245303 -->
<p>But we're not the only ones with thoughts on Nintendo's latest, oh no! Below, we've put together a round-up of the critical consensus as it stands, and it'll come as no surprise to hear that it's really rather positive.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/super-mario-galaxy-12-review-despite-pointer-issues-this-is-still-3d-platforming-at-its-very-best/">VGC</a>, where Galaxy 1 + 2 got a full 5/5. The outlet had some issues with the new gyro aiming, but ultimately felt that "Both games remain the high point of creativity in the platform game genre":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odyssey may have since topped the Galaxy games with its sheer craftsmanship, but, in my eyes, this is still 3D Mario platforming at its very best, which also makes Galaxy and Galaxy 2 some of Nintendo’s very best games.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-1-2-review-nintendo-switch-2-492056-20250930">GAMINGbible</a> awarded a similar 10/10 in its review and found very little to be negative about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</em> are effectively the perfect package: two of the greatest video games of all time, just as you remember them, with only a few minor touchups here and there. This is, for my money, the best way to play two of the greatest video games ever made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things dropped ever so slightly in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-1-and-2-switch-review/">Destructoid</a>'s 9/10 review, where the only real sticking point is the bundle's much-discussed price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it's hard not to talk about the price, it's hard not to deny that these games are still masterpieces nearly 20 years after their release on Wii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/super-mario-galaxy-and-super-mario-galaxy-2-are-as-magical-as-ever-on-nintendo-switch-2">TechRadar</a> gave Galaxy 1 + 2 a 4.5/5, agreeing that it's the "definitive way to play two of the best Mario adventures of all time", though half-wishing there was a little more new content thrown in too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The combination of rock-solid performance, upgraded visuals, and new story content makes these experiences worth revisiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/super-mario-galaxy-1-and-2-nintendo-switch-review-price/">TheGamer</a> opted for the marginally lower 4/5, enjoying almost everything the package had to offer, but struggling to get past the price or occasionally outdated mechanics and controls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is now the definitive means to experience two of the best platformers ever made, it’s just unfortunate that the package is prohibitively expensive and borderline insulting to those who want to enjoy it most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if the <strong>Zelda</strong> series starred the Grim Reaper? What if it starred a pig? These are questions we all ask on a daily basis, right? Well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spindle">Spindle</a> is here to answer them.</p>
<p>This upcoming pixel art action adventure is set to arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>13th October</strong>, and it looks really rather sweet. It boasts all the hallmarks of the Nintendo series that has so clearly served as a touchstone — puzzley dungeons, elemental bosses, a beach filled with nasty crabs — but with some added swine-based sweetness. What's not to like?</p>
<p>It's not all fun and games, mind you. Spindle dev Wobble Ghost doesn't use the ol' Grim Reaper lightly, and the story promises to navigate big themes like death, grief, and healing in your own way.</p>
<p>Here's a little more information on the game itself and a handful of screenshots from publisher Deck13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Spindle</strong></em> invites you to go on a lovingly hand-crafted journey that’s inspired by the games of our childhood, packed with <strong>charming characters and beautiful environments</strong>. With your scythe sharp and your wits even sharper, explore <strong>twisting dungeons filled with cunning foes and clever riddles</strong> as you unravel the mystery bit by bit. The deeper you go, the more the shadows seem to watch… ready to find out what’s <em>really</em> waiting in the dark?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>October is a particularly busy month for game releases, but this looks like it could fit the bill if you're after something sweet and sincere.</p>
