<figure data-uuid="bd12a019bd879"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd12a019bd879/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is out this week, and in case you missed it, it comes with all sorts of enhancements. Apart from the resolution boost on the Switch 2, the game also supports the system's Joy-Con 2 mouse mode feature, which is a welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Before you jump in and try this out, there's one thing you might want to know. This mode can only be accessed in the 'Co-Star Mode' with a second player. Here's the full rundown about this from our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Co-Star Mode’ makes a welcome return for those who wish to bring a friend on board to help gather Star Bits or defeat enemies. Player Two waggles their Joy-Con about to move the onscreen cursor, but if you’re on Switch 2, you can also use the console’s mouse functionality, and it works wonderfully. Chances are you’ll play both games solo, but it’s a nice little extra regardless."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890ruvnqo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>So, if you were hoping to experience mouse mode on a single-player run, it seems you're out of luck. You'll need to call on a friend, family member, or someone else if you want to properly test it out. Once again, this control mode in these new versions is only accessible to Switch 2 users.</p>
<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be made available on 2nd October, with fans also able to purchase each game separately from the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> this week, Nintendo has released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> on the Switch.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo's official support page, Version 1.2.2 addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience. It doesn't go into any details beyond this, but if we find out what is going on behind the scenes here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Compatibility with existing versions is also noted, so be mindful of that. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Ver. 1.2.2 (Released September 30, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Note: Does have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.2.1-1.1.0. Does not have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.0.0. Please be careful of the update version on each player’s system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major update for this same title in June</a>, which optimised the game's visuals and frame rate for the Switch 2. It also added HDR support in Bowser's Fury and a GameShare option.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the original release on Switch in our review here on Nintendo Life. Bowser's Fury is also well worth a look, if you haven't already given it a go.</p>

<p>Expect improved FPS, load times and more</p>

<figure data-uuid="d04ea720d106d"><a title="Warframe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d04ea720d106d/warframe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Extremes (via Steam)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, the team at Digital Extremes provided a development update on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a> - confirming a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the free-to-play title was officially in the works.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent developer livestream, the team has shared the first gameplay footage from this particular build of the game, now that they've finally got their hands on some dev kits. It highlights faster load times, higher shading quality, improved frame rate, and more.</p>

<p>You can see a little <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2575538613">more gameplay footage</a> in the official stream around the 28-minute mark. Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair reiterates how the load times are much shorter than the Switch counterpart, and also notes how this new version of the title will apparently target 60fps in docked mode.</p>
<p>There's no information just yet about when exactly the Switch 2 version of Warframe will be released, but when we hear more, we'll be sure to let you know. Warframe was made available for the original Switch in 2018. The port specialists at Panic Button helped out with this version of the game at the time, and we labelled it a "remarkable technical feat" for Nintendo's hybrid system.</p>

<p>When this paid "online-only" experience was released on the eShop, we gave it five out of ten stars and raised concerns at the time about how long it would remain active. It followed the original release of <strong>Pac-Man: Mega Tunnel Battle</strong> on Google Stadia in 2020.</p>
<p>This latest Pac-Man game shutdown follows the end of the Nintendo Switch Online title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pac-man_99">PAC-MAN 99</a> in October 2023.</p>
