<p>Patch notes haven't been shared just yet</p>

<figure data-uuid="735044a1074d8"><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/735044a1074d8/tomb-raider-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Aspyr, Crystal Dynamics</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the surprise release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch and Switch 2 last November, Aspyr said it would continue to update the Nintendo versions with patches over time to provide the "best possible experience for all players".</p>
<p>With this in mind, it seems an update has been recently released, bumping the game from Version 1.0.1 up to <strong>Version 1.0.2</strong> (thanks for the heads up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/canaryfarmer" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Life user canaryfarmer</a>). The official patch notes don't appear to be available just yet, but this hasn't stopped fans from investigating what's changed.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q8cbzf/update_released_for_switch_2_v102/">early impressions</a> (<em>and as you might expect</em>), there are at least some tweaks and adjustments to improve the overall experience on Nintendo's platforms. Players have also apparently uncovered a few other details, claiming there are adjustments to "shadows" and "foilage", <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-has-shadow-dropped-both-on-switch-and-switch-2.15663/page-4#post-2128335">but other fan reports</a> suggest gyroscope controls and certain other control methods still aren't working with the game.</p>


<figure data-uuid="3dbe0ad375bc1"><a title="Famiboards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3dbe0ad375bc1/famiboards.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-has-shadow-dropped-both-on-switch-and-switch-2.15663/page-4#post-2128335">Famiboards</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, when we get the official patch notes from Aspyr, we'll provide an update about what exactly has changed, but for now you can at least update your game and hopefully experience an improved version.</p>
<p>When this title shadow dropped on the Switch 2 last year, we thought the overall experience on the Switch 2 was "great" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">awarding it 8 out of 10 stars</a>), even if it's not quite as 'Definitive' as the name suggests. Thankfully, the core gameplay experience is still a thrilling action romp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Crystal Dynamics’ 2013 reinvention of Lara Croft just might be the best entry in this decades-old franchise, and for the asking price, you’re getting a thrilling action romp that’ll keep you hooked until the credits."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Including multiple fixes for Switch and Switch 2</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="bcf0132bff80c"><a title="Fantasy Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bcf0132bff80c/fantasy-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 has continued to roll out updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, and the latest one is now officially available.</p>
<p>It bumps the game up to Version 2.0.4 on the Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms. This includes some fixes specific to the Switch and Switch 2 (which had already been fixed on other platforms). Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Level-5's support page:</p>
<h3>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Version 2.0.4 (13th Jan 2026)</h3>
<p>Feature Additions/ Adjustments</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted Remake Settings for Armor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted Version 2.0.0 armor items exchangeable at Don's Dreamy Deals to allow Remake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in Snoozaland where controls could become unresponsive if the player touched a gatherable item at the moment the effect ended during the "Bam Headbang Dream," which is triggered by interacting with a Drowsy Mimic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Only for Switch 2 | Switch (These issues has already been fixed in the PS5® / PS4® / Xbox / Steam versions):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where items would sometimes not appear in multiplayer on Snoozaland when flying with Skelegon to an Alchemy Robot after alchemy was completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in multiplayer on Snoozaland where guest players could not move to the boss area during the mission "Trimming the Divine Beard" when the party attempted to enter it together, if the host had acquired the Woodcutter Life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in the Snoozaland tutorial where, if the time of day changed before the Tropic Toads in the first area was defeated, players were unable to proceed to the next area afterward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in the Snoozaland tutorial where, if a field enemy's attack hit the player immediately after opening the supply box, event progression could become blocked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where crafting could sometimes start without switching Lives upon returning to Base Camp after collecting gatherable items in the "Bam Headbang Dream" triggered by touching a Drowsy Mimic in Snoozaland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where the Snoozaland unlock tutorial could be started during multiplayer through a specific sequence of actions. Ending multiplayer in that state could save progress and prevent further progression in Snoozaland.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This follows on from the announcement Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will be receiving another major update in February. This will follow The Sinister Broker Bazario's Schemes update in December 2025.</p>

<p>Nintendo released a new system firmware update for the Switch 2 yesterday and it's resolved some compatibility issues.</p>
<p>There's been an issue with the 2021 releases <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a></strong>, with both Switch titles reportedly crashing from time to time on the new hybrid system. Fortunately, Nintendo appears to have finally resolved these problems after the rollout of the 21.2.0 system firmware.</p>
<p>This is now officially reflected on Nintendo's <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">software compatibility search page</a>:</p><div><figure data-videoid="UhXw8bSC6A0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytUhXw8bSC6A0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38ea9bhqvwrn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 01/13/2026</strong> - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One other game fixed is the "RTS, tower defense, and match-3" title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cats_on_duty">Cats on Duty</a> (<em>yes, you read that correctly</em>), which is <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/01006b401d426000">now fully supported</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also identified an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe</a> on the Switch 2 tied to audio issues in certain areas of the game, so we'll hopefully see a fix for this soon. Once again, you can find out more about the compatibility of Switch titles on the Switch 2 via Nintendo's software compatibility search page.</p>
