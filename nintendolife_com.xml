<figure data-uuid="9c0289c7c8b27"><a title="GUN Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c0289c7c8b27/gun-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever feel like getting your video game cowboy on, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> and its kinda bloated sequel, as good as they are, just take way too long to bed into?</p>
<p>You know what I mean. Rockstar's epics are the obvious go-to choices in this scenario. However, sometimes I just want to shoot stuff in the cowboy style, almost immediately if possible, and I don't want to waste time with hugely intricate plots and overwhelming world aspects that drag a playthrough out to a triple-digit hour count. Who has time for that in this economy? (Me, but that's probably best kept for another article on a different website.)</p>
<p>There are a few options for a faster six-shooter fix. Indeed, Rockstar's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/red_dead_revolver">Red Dead Revolver</a> is much more in line with what I'm thinking. But you've more than likely played that, either at launch or once you'd made your way through Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/gun">GUN</a> <em>*kicks swinging saloon doors open*</em>, Neversoft's 2005 Western action effort, which is 20 years old today! Here's an oft-overlooked gem of a game that still has the capacity to serve you up exactly what you're after. Heck, it even still looks real purdy.</p>
<p>Now, we didn't review GUN back in the day, which is a shame <em>[<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/site-news-nintendo-life-turns-20-today">The website <strong>was</strong> only a day old!</a> - Ed.]</em>, but it reviewed well across the board, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. With the passing of time, you could actually consider one of the biggest criticisms at release — a very empty and smallish open world — as one of its stronger points nowadays. Especially if, like me, you never want to see another sprawling, icon-laden world map in your life. Well, not for a few weeks anyway.</p>

<p>Let's start with my favourite bit of this one: the cast.</p>
<p>We've got Thomas Jane, Lance Henriksen, Ron Perlman, Brad Dourif, and none other than Kris "sort of a god" Kristofferson showing up in this Western tale, and they've not <em>just</em> shown up, either. They're not phoning it in and hightailing it out of there with their bag of swag. No. There's some solid acting going on, and as a result, the whole thing is given a completely unnecessary level of gravitas. The story here, written by Randall Jahnsen (of <strong>The Doors</strong> movie fame), is no match for Red Dead's hugely serious tale, make no mistake, but it isn't aiming for that. It's going for old-school tension, shocks, and twists that are more immediate in nature.</p>
<p>Jahnsen opted for a tale of revenge that plays it cold and ruthless in the classic <strong>Unforgiven</strong> vein. It revolves around Colton White (Jane) and his dad (Kristofferson) as they head off in search of Colton's dear Jenny (<strong>Rugrats</strong> alumni, Kath Souchie) who's been kidnapped by the murderous Reverend Reed (Dourif). Across the campaign, we're treated to violent shootouts, horseback action sequences and sweet on-rails sections that still play great today. I'm not just saying that either, I'm playing it right now, and it looks and feels very nice, thanks.</p>
<p>In fact, it plays much better than I remember, and the GameCube version is no slouch, running at a super smooth clip and looking every bit as nice as other ports. As I mentioned, the open world here is slight in its size and activities, a criticism in 2005, but now it means it's a much more straightforward and time-respectful sort of thing. There's no need to spend 100 hours picking flowers here, and you get to shoot stuff in the first couple of minutes. A win for common sense!</p>

<p>The shooting, which incorporates a de rigueur slo-mo six-shooter mechanic (here called QuickDraw), also comes off much better these days, I reckon. It was criticised — outside of those focused slo-mo parts — for being a little too tough to aim. However, I'm of the opinion that it's more authentic than tightly auto-aimed nonsense. You need to concentrate a bit and place your shots, and that works for me.</p>
<p>There's also a cracking lineup of era-authentic guns to collect from dead bosses and such along the way. Winchesters, Colts, Schofield rifles that blow heads into bloody pulp when aimed just so. You even get to do a little bit of archery, firing great big cannons. Have I mentioned that it's very bloody? Good.</p>
<p>So, the third-person pew-pew action, and the flow of the world, come off pretty great to this day, and it's a world that, despite its small scale, provides plenty of suitably epic vistas, alongside some impressive urban areas, whilst still managing to look fine in 2025. This is one of those 'early-noughties beige' numbers. You know, dusty and rusted in an attempt to seem adult, and as a result, it's got it where it counts in terms of atmosphere. It's very jaggy round the edges, for sure, but there's a level of detail and some proper cinematography going on, so it gets away with it.</p>

<p>Once the story kicks into gear, once Colton is on his way to Empire City to meet the likes of Mayor Hoodoo Brown (Perlman), and once all hell subsequently breaks loose, we're then treated to a lovely mix of shootouts, proper no-messing hard cowboy dialogue, and levels, such as a fantastic stagecoach one, that don't outstay their welcome. You also gotta turn up just to hear some classic gruff cowboy lines delivered with the swagger of this all-star cast, too.</p>
<p>GUN also benefits from a very edgy and 'of its time' attitude in some respects. It's a little subversive here and there (I won't spoil), and it even draws in some story influences from places you might not expect. It gets a bit...supernatural. So it's got a whole off-kilter thing going on, backed up by the weird awesomeness of that cast.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> an attempt to make the world feel bigger through the ability to track down a few wanted criminals, hunting animals, or doing a spot of ranching, but these are the parts where GUN falls down. No, it's in the crazy assembly of amazingly talented actors, in that uniquely rust-tinged noughties atmosphere, and in some incredibly violent and pleasing shootouts that GUN excels.</p>

<p>At 20 years of age, plenty of video game cowboys have long since hung up their holsters. GUN, though, if you're willing to give it a shot, still has it all where it counts. If you're hankerin' for some straightforward cowboy roleplaying, with no need for 100 hours to spare, or a therapist to get you through Arthur Morgan's trauma, you'll have a fairly tough time finding many games that fill the role better than Neversoft's crack at America's Wild West.</p>
<p>Who'd have thought that the Tony Hawks dev team would serve so hard in this particular genre?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a> has received multiple updates since it launched earlier this year and alongside Update 1.3.0, Firaxis Games has now released the <strong>Tides of Power Collection</strong>.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-tides-of-power-collection-70070000031661-switch/">"free to claim" on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop</a> until <strong>5th January 2026</strong> and is "yours to keep permanently at no cost". After this date, you'll be required to purchase it.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown about what you can expect, along with an official graphic, and below this are the full details about the DLC (via the game's website patch notes):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Tides of Power Update:</strong> This is now fully claimable on Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch...Starting today, add Edward Teach, Republic of Pirates, and Tonga content packs to your game, and then receive the Sayyida al Hurra, Ottomans, and Iceland content packs in-game when they're released in December 2025.

<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>

<h2 id="civilization-vii-tides-of-power-collection-4th-november-2025">Civilization VII: Tides of Power Collection (4th November 2025)</h2>
<h2 id="leaders">Leaders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added new leader Edward Teach.</strong></p>
<p>Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate whose name sparked dread in the captains of the Caribbean. In 1716, he joined the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, a leader of the Flying Gang, and quickly gained his own ships. With his impressive height, his long beard (decorated with, at times, lit fuses), and reputation for violence, he stalked the sea-lanes of the Caribbean and the nightmares of sailors. He outlived the Flying Gang and moved his operation to the Outer Banks of present-day North Carolina, where a pirate hunter, Robert Maynard, finally caught up with him.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Militaristic, Economic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Blackbeard</strong>: All Naval Units gain the Pirate Ability, allowing them to cross borders of other civilizations, Plunder Trade Routes from non-Allied civilizations, and attack Naval Units of non-Allied civilizations without declaring war. Defeating any Naval Units with your own Naval Units provides Gold equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength and captures that Unit. Increased Gold maintenance costs for all Naval Units.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda – Queen Anne’s Revenge</strong>: Increase Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that build Naval Units. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that neglect to build Naval Units.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="civilizations">Civilizations</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Exploration Age civilization Republic of Pirates.</strong></p>
<p>Where there is wealth, there is greed. The scramble for new world riches in the early 18th century brought English, Spanish, French, and Dutch fleets – but the prospect of quick riches also brought pirates. These were rarely organized, but in 1706, one band, the Flying Gang, took over the island of New Providence in the Bahamas and set up a short-lived republic for all who sought fortune... and came with few scruples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Economic, Militaristic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Flying Gang</strong>: Increased Yields from Pillaging and Coastal Raiding with Naval Units. Settler Units cannot be trained or purchased, but you can capture other civilizations' Settlers. Naval Units, Treasure Convoys, and Buccaneer Units can move into other civilizations' borders without being at war or having Open Borders.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Buccaneer</strong>: Unique Commander Unit. Gains a set number of charges to use the 'Raiding Party' Action every set number of Promotions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Action - Raiding Party</strong>: Targets an adjacent Treasure Resource. This Settlement instantly spawns a Treasure Convoy under your control equal to the number of Treasure Resources; this does not reset until another Treasure Convoy is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Sloop</strong>: Unique Naval Unit (replaces Privateer). Can cross other civilizations' borders, Pillage Trade Routes between non-Allied civilizations, and attack Units of non-Allied civilizations without going to war. Can move after attacking and has a set amount of Movement.</li>
<li><strong>Associated Wonder – Havana Harbor</strong>: Gold Base. This Settlement generates Treasure Convoys worth a set amount of Treasure Fleet points in the Exploration Age (effect scales based on game speed). Increased Economic Attribute. Must be built in Distant Lands on Coastal Tiles adjacent to non-Lake tiles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Antiquity Age civilization Tonga.</strong></p>
<p>Into the endless blue, in search of new lands on scattered islands, the Polynesians sailed, settling the island of Tonga nearly three thousand years ago. Around 1000 CE, though, came another expansion, the Tu’i Tonga Empire – a struggle for dominance, tribute, and fealty over the Pacific. The Tongan kings maintained this system of hierarchical lordship over the islands until it, too, splintered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Expansionist, Diplomatic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Lords of the South</strong>: Increased Influence on City Halls and the Palace if adjacent to Coast tiles. Cannot incorporate City-States.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Tehina</strong>: Unique Scout Unit. Can enter Ocean tiles (without taking damage) and embark at the start of the Age. Cannot disembark in Distant Lands, but can use Coastal Raid on adjacent Discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Kalia</strong>: Increased Combat Strength against Districts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wonders">Wonders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added four new Wonders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great Lighthouse – Antiquity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold Base. Grants a free Merchant when built. +15 Water Trade Route Range in all Settlements. +1 Sight to all Naval Units. Must be built on a Coast tile adjacent to Land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nan Madol – Exploration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provides +3 Culture, +3 Production, and +3 Happiness on the Palace and City Hall on Islands (a landmass with a maximum of 15 tiles). Must be built in an Island City on Coast adjacent to Land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Great Blue Hole – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Science and +4 Happiness. Adjacent sea rural tiles receive +2 Culture. Placed on the Coast adjacent to 6 coast tiles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mapu'a Vaea Blowholes – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Production and +4 Happiness. +2 Culture to all Coastal land tiles in this Settlement. Impassable.</li>
<li>Placed on the Coast adjacent to Cliffs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<p>Firaxis has also included some platform-specific updates tied to the Switch and Switch 2 in Update 1.3.0. This includes the following:</p>
<p><strong>Switch / Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR options now appear when undocking Switch.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where the last character entered with the virtual keyboard would appear incorrectly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the absence of a major Animal Crossing announcement, this week felt a little quieter than last, but there was still plenty to get excited about. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC scored a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-legends-z-as-mega-dimension-dlc-scores-december-release-date">December release date</a>, and we got a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-mystery-gift-code-event-has-been-announced">Mystery Gift event</a> in the process.

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> at the moment, so I’ve gone back to the old favourites: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, and yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>. Considering the appearance of Alyssa Ashcroft in the upcoming title, I’d love for Capcom to provide a legitimate way to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a> on modern consoles, but alas, I don’t think it’s happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>We’ve also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami 2</a> on the horizon, so I’ve gone back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> for a little bit. Truth be told, alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, this might actually be my favourite launch game for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm in the fun little position of being <em>between games</em> after wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> earlier this week, and not wanting to splash out on anything else 'AAA' until Metroid comes a-calling. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> is still eating up my every free moment (obviously), but maybe now it my chance to sneak in something smaller before the year's up. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> has been looking at me from my wishlist for a while now, so perhaps it's finally time to dive in.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I just remembered that I've had <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> on pause while I put Pokémon in the rear-view mirror. <em>That's</em> the weekend's plan sorted, then.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm hoping to polish off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> this weekend. I've found myself playing/watching a little bit every morning over breakfast, as if I were channel-hopping before school as a kid. It's a cracking little piece of software - look out for a review sometime soon-ish.</p>
<p>Beyond that (and keeping with the early '90s theme), I found myself redownloading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> just to get a look at the Simpsons stuff. After dying twice in a row extremely early doors, I enabled gyro and made it to #2 on the third jump from the bus. First loser! It's a weird thing, Fortnite these days, but I did enjoy most of those 20 minutes. Maybe I'll dip back into that.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> proves that every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow, just like in real life. While there has been zero progress since last weekend (except, of course, making Melinöe stronger with each demise), I hope to turn the tables this weekend. Lots of high adrenaline arcade action as well, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-tokyo-wars">Arcade Archives 2: Tokyo Wars</a>' bare-bones single player experience quickly turns into a frenetic split-screen multiplayer extravaganza (I miss Wii U’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tank_tank_tank">Tank! Tank! Tank!</a> …) and both Toaplan’s Arcade Collection volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 50 of 50 games played! The final five titles are all absolute stunners! 'Combatants' (clever pun!) is all bout real-time tactics with fighting ants, 'Quibble Race' finally made me understand Japanese obsession with horse racing simulations, 'Seaside Drive' is purest shmup bliss, 'Campanella 3' is the final game in the series and goes full <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> and to wrap up this package the multi-genre, 'Cyber Owls', which I hope to complete this weekend. What an incredible package, part of me wants 'Super UFO 50' to happen, with SNES-style graphics and music… one can dream!</p>
<p>My game of the week is Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Being a huge fan of this spin-off series and the added hardware strength of the Switch 2, I see nothing but a very good time ahead. Are you a person who finds the whole Musou gameplay strangely soothing and great stress relief? Just me?</p>

<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>I’ve got to admit, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has hooked me far more than I expected it would. The criticism about the sameness of the environments and the rather wooden NPCs is completely fair, but I still find it hard to put down. I particularly enjoy hunting for Alpha Pokémon and having an oversized critter following me around. The battle system feels fresh and fluid — and occasionally challenging, which makes for a nice change. I was genuinely taken aback by how good the Mega Dimensions DLC looks. It really seems to cater to high-level play, though I’m not exactly thrilled about the price point.</p>
<p>I’m also completely addicted to BALL x PIT. It gets me into that flow state I love, scratches the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> itch, and does something new and mechanically interesting that you don’t often see in other Survivors-likes. It’s such a fresh and satisfying gameplay loop.</p>
<p>I’ve also been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi’s Mansion</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. I missed it back in the day, but I can definitely see what people mean about the spooky atmosphere of this first entry compared with the next two in the series. The original just nails that haunted house vibe a bit better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, which is objectively a better game in almost every respect.</p>

Following the 1.2 patch towards the end of last month, the team has now released a few more update.</p>
<p>Below are both sets of patch notes, with PopCap noting how Patch V.1.4.0 is also "close to being done".</p>
<p>The latest updates include Nintendo-specific fixes and improvements. In v1.3.0 this includes some fixes tied to GameShare and GameChat, and the previous update v.1.2.1 includes adjustments and updates to mouse mode, and more.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wzhjkv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Audio:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Minigame, Puzzle, Survival and Almanac menus now play the correct music instead of the previous menu's music</li>
<li>Sound effects no longer overlap menu music at higher game speeds</li>
<li>Added missing menu open SFX for Pause Menu</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Disabling Vsync no longer impacts Mouse cursor speed</li>
<li>Fixed plants showing incorrectly when collecting sun while dragging them to be placed with Touch inputs</li>
<li>Dr. Zomboss no longer signs his notes with a comma after his name (We wonder if Tugboat was forging those notes for him)</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed GameShare via GameChat not detecting the current profile properly if it was not in the 1st profile position</li>
<li>We are aware that Switch patches have been lagging behind other platforms and taking longer than expected to release. This is due to certification timelines and we intend to release them as soon as possible.
<ul>
<li>To check your game version select the game icon in the main menu and press the plus button. The game version will be visible at the top of the screen, right under the game name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"And just like every garden, there’s still some more work to be done. Patch V1.4.0 is close to being done which will add the ability to collect sun with the squeeze of a trigger on controllers and aim to get rid of some more pesky bugs among other things!</p>
<p>"Expect this patch to go live within the next two weeks with more details of the next patch being shared closer to its release. So stay tuned and once again, thanks for your support, feedback, and patience! Now let’s get back on the lawn and listen to those sweet tunes!"</p>
