<p>Emulate seventy years of premier motorsport</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's been another solid year for arcade racing fans on Nintendo platforms so far, and there's even more to come...</p>
<p>The independent studio 3DCloud has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/formula_legends">Formula Legends</a> will be racing onto the original Switch later this year on <strong>18th September 2025</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $19.99 / €19.99</strong>.</p>
<p>This new title, offering a "mixture of arcade and sim-focused racing gameplay" which "emulates the last seventy years" of the world's premier motorsport - including the tracks, drivers, teams, and cars, which are all "playfully inspired by racing's past and present".</p>
<p>There's also a Switch eShop demo "coming later this month", so be on the lookout for that. This demo includes two game modes (custom and time attack), two tracks (Belgium and Hungary), three iconic racing eras, new extreme weather, fully customisable gameplay and new camera modes.</p>
<p>Apart from a Switch release, this title is also coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. If we hear anything about a Switch 2 version, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Here are the full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo launched the Switch 2 earlier this year in June, it also released multiple free game updates for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these updates was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> - adding visual optimisations, Joy-Con 2 mouse support and more. Now in a new update, it's rolled out Version 1.1.1. This particular patch tackles some issues when playing this title on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's support page. If there is anything else going on with this latest patch, we'll let you know.</p>
<h2>Game Builder Garage: Ver. 1.1.1 (Released August 5, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General Fixes</strong></p>
<p>Fixed issues with system functionality when playing using a Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Note: An update addressing the issue above is now available for <em>Game Builder Garage: Demo Version</em> as well (Ver. 1.1.1).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In the previous update, Nintendo also released a patch for the demo version of Game Builder Garage.</p>
<p>These latest updates for Game Builder Garage also happen to tie in with the four year anniversary. In June, the game's community even held an unofficial 'Direct' presentation, showcasing the many games and demos made within the software. You can see more in the video above and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/game-builder-garage-fan-made-direct-reveals-multiple-amazing-new-creations-alongside-switch-2-update">our previous story</a>.</p>

<p>This patch for Game Builder Garage follows an update to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>Following Nintendo identifying a bug in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> last week, an update has now been officially rolled out.</p>
<p>This issue was tied to the game's upload records of rankings, and it's apparently operating as it should once again. Apart from the Switch 2 version, this same update is also available for the original Switch release.</p>
<p>Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page. If we find out about anything else going on behind the scene, we'll let you know.</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 2.1.1 (Released August 5, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bug Fix</strong></p>
<p>Fixed a bug where, when playing on Nintendo Switch 2 and following certain steps, in online rankings for certain minigames, records are uploaded that haven’t actually been achieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Mario Party Jamboree was originally released towards the end of last month. As previously detailed, it adds mouse mode games, camera games and microphone party games. You can also get an upgrade if you own the original Switch release and have access to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>You learn more about this latest game update for Super Mario Party Jamboree in our review. We had a fun time with it, awarding it an "excellent" nine out of ten stars. Nintendo has also updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> today.</p>

<p>Defeat Eggman, again</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> has announced a new update for its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> collaboration DLC, and it's out today.</p>
<p>The 'Super Update' is a new add-on where you'll need to gather the Chaos Emeralds, defeat Dr. Eggman and transform into Super Sonic and Super Shadow.</p>

<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog DLC for Minecraft has previously added iconic zones, awesome characters, thrilling abilities, and various familiar-looking enemies.</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering, Minecraft hasn't received an upgrade or anything similar for the Switch 2 (at least yet), but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>In some other Sonic news, it was recently revealed the blue blur will be <a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/sonic-racing-cross-worlds-announces-beyblade-x-collaboration/">teaming up with Beyblades</a> in his new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.

<p>A release date is coming "Soon"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6823f9ff7d40/yooka-replaylee.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Playtonic Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, a remaster of the 2017 3D collectathon platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, is "content complete" and a release date announcement is "coming...SoonTM".</p>
<p>This comes from PM Studios, the physical game publisher who is handling Yooka-Replaylee's release. The company shared a video on Bluesky giving us a very short explanation on what to expect.</p>
<p>The video confirms that the game is "content complete" and Playtonic are currently in the playtesting phase, looking for bugs to iron out.</p>

<p>We don't know when that "soon" is, of course. It could be the Indie World showcase on Thursday, but it also could be at gamescom Opening Night Live, which is on 19th August.</p>
<p>Basically, there are many places we could find out, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to this remaster in the comments</em>.</p>
