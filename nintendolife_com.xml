<p>You may have already played Bad Viking's first game in the 'Strange' series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, a gothically-tinged tale of running a plant shop, but with more than a touch of Lovecraftian business lurking in the shadows. As someone who's a little bored of the more toothless cosy games on the market, I'm always delighted to find something with sinister undercurrents and supernatural goings-on. Also, ritual murder! Not enough cosy games feature ritual murder.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxmwiv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Strange Antiquities might be more of the same after Horticulture, but it's a great formula. People come in, they tell you their woes, and you use your logical and deductive skills to locate the object on your shelves that will solve their problems.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6842ca14e81eb"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6842ca14e81eb/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The clever thing is that your shelves are filled with a ton of objects that could, potentially, fit the vague description in the book, and it takes careful reading and attention to clues to pick the right one. If you're looking for something made of gold, should you pick the necklace, or the totem? If you need something that represents a lunar goddess, should you pick an item made in her image, or in the shape of the moon? For detective game sickos like me (and you, I bet) who love having to decipher cryptic clues like you're trying to ask Rumpelstiltskin for directions, this is basically catnip.</p>
<p>Strange Antiques also has that rare quality of making the player feel masterful, which is hard to achieve, because the player usually has absolutely <em>zero</em> experience doing whatever it is the game's about. I love <strong>Ace Attorney</strong>, but I know diddly squat about the law, and although I technically have grown vegetables in my real-life garden, my harvest has never been as bountiful or marketable as those I grow in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've never been a semi-magical purveyor of arcane goods who occasionally explores graveyards and ruins to find more (although if you see a job posting for that, please send it to me), but Strange Antiquities – with all its reference tomes and maps – makes me feel incredibly competent at the task. A customer comes in, says something unhelpfully ambiguous about their ailment, and waits patiently as I comb through my books, cross-reference them with items, and finally settle on an object to give them.</p>
<figure data-uuid="43c04ae1d9981"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43c04ae1d9981/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're not giving out curios and knicknacks, you're exploring, through Strange Antiquities' concise and clever daily riddles. Some of these riddles are presented as text – "An escaped prisoner ran north-west. He hid me in the first building he came to" – which require you to find a location on a map that corresponds to its clues. In that example, you have to find a prison, trace a line northwest, and find the first building on that line. That one's easy, because it's the first one, but it still has that fulfilling sense of reading between the lines that all good detective games cultivate.</p>
<p>Other riddles are more opaque, providing you with nothing but a shape, and hoping that you'll have studied your maps enough to recognise that it's the outline of a house, or a tombstone, or a room. These puzzles need you to notice subtle details, read between the lines, and cultivate an internal spatial understanding of each area, in order to solve the riddle. Asking players to engage with the world on such an intimate level is genius – it creates a sense of player-directed immersion that adds to that feeling of mastery and ownership.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that, in a year dominated by detective-y puzzle-y games, most of which are not on the Switch (boo), I feel like Strange Antiquities has flown a little under the radar. The much-lauded clique of <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong>The Roottrees are Dead</strong>, <strong>The Drifter</strong>, <strong>The Seance of Blake Manor</strong>, <strong>Type Help</strong>, and the various <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rise_of_the_golden_idol">Golden Idol</a> add-ons deserve their praise, but Strange Antiquities deserves to be up there on the puzzle podium with them. It's tough when the competition is so stiff!</p>
<p>So, if you're reading this and you enjoy clues and riddles and all that business, give Strange Antiquities a go (plus Strange Horticulture, if you haven't already played it). And then add it to your Game of The Year list, because it's certainly earned a place on mine. And it's not just because a strange shopkeeper gave me a <em>Purified Amulet Of GOTY</em>. I don't think, anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Hopefully, many of you are enjoying an end-of-year break over the holidays, but even if you're back at the coalface before the new year arrives, we recommend making time to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJvpRGibFhg">this fascinating new overview documentary</a> of the NES' US launch from Frank Cifaldi and the folks over at the Video Game History Foundation.</p>
<p>Building on his years of research, and following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA">the excellent panel</a> at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo back in October (featuring NOA veterans Gail Tilden, Lance Barr, and Bruce Lowry - we'll embed the archived video at the bottom of the page), this new 45-minute video went live on Christmas Day and explores the ins and outs of the Famicom's journey to the US, its transformation into the Nintendo Entertainment System, and how its New York test market launch set the system up for monster success in the second half of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Cifaldi presents a condensed timeline of events, bringing together materials from the VGHF's archive with other sources for a brilliant, fresh look at a story you may think you know well. Starting when an initial deal with Atari fell through, which led to Minoru Arakawa and his Nintendo of America team wondering if they themselves had the means and wherewithal to bring the system to the US, Cifaldi highlights discouraging feedback from various rounds of focus group testing and advice, which NOA thankfully ignored.</p>
<p>Nintendo fans may believe there's nothing new to say about this much-told story, but the VGHF team does a great job of working in new tidbits and putting the record straight on points you <em>think</em> you know.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d2cf678c1256a"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2cf678c1256a/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, yes, Lance Barr headed the industrial design for the Westernised Famicom hardware (using Bang &amp; Olufsen's sleek hi-fi gear as inspiration for the shell), but did you know that the thick 'brick' we all know and love — well, we all know it, at least — was actually the work of NCL's engineers riffing on Barr's efforts?</p>
<p>The team at Nintendo's Japanese parent company, worried about dust getting into the slot of a top-loading console, took Barr's sexier, B&amp;O-inspired design (known as the AVS before it became the NES) and bulked it out massively to include the front-loading cart mechanism. Barr himself was disappointed with the resulting 'lunchbox' when it appeared.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>did</em> know that already, you're guaranteed to find new info in the essay. The 45 minutes fly by, it ties up the opening Atari thread beautifully at the end, and we highly recommend settling down with it between now and the new year.</p>
<p>And if you're so inclined, head over to <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">gamehistory.org/donate</a> to find the VGHF's Winter Fundraiser and support Frank and the team's excellent work.</p>

<p>It's time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Well, not really. The massively popular Switch will live on in a way few other Nintendo consoles have done thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility</a>, a host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free upgrades to existing games</a>, and a Switch 2 form factor that keeps everything about the previous console.

<p>However, assuming the games play as advertised and the upscaling doesn't bork 720p games on Switch 2's 1080p screen, then a great many of us will be retiring our trusty console - or donating it to someone else.</p>
<p>After eight long years, it's an emotional time, so we thought we'd take a look back at the system — or <em>systems</em> (the replacements, the Lites, the OLEDs we've added to the family) — that kept us going since 2017, though good and bad, sickness and health, 'til Switch 2 us part.</p>
<p>Let's take one last look at the Switches Nintendo Lifers will be packing away very soon...</p>
<h2>A life Switch-up (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4c77861eeb56e"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c77861eeb56e/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My floor isn't always this messy... — <em><span></span> Image: Alana Hagues / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's weird to think that I almost didn't get a Switch straight away. I felt burned by the Wii U's launch, so I was tentative about picking up another launch-day console. Then I got home from work on 3rd March 2017 and there was my mum, with a shiny new boxed Nintendo Switch and a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. The Switch was my very first 'adult' console — as in, it was the first new console I owned as an adult. And in the eight years since, I've had two OG models, a Lite, and three different OLEDs.</p>
<p>Those Switches have been my rock. I took my OG to two separate E3s. It was my companion for many plane and train rides. The Switch was there through a break-up, buying my first apartment, through the-year-we-don't-talk-about, waiting for me post-therapy. Importantly, my OLED was there for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_party_superstars">Mario Party</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> sessions during my long-distance relationship, and it's here now after my move to America to live with my partner.</p>
<p>We have two OLEDs between us, so while one will probably be tucked away, the other will stay out for now. I can't quite say goodbye to the console just yet. I may reserve a lot of love for older systems, but the Switch is one of my favourites. I'm not sure I would be doing what I do now at Nintendo Life without the Switch. So, thank you, you lovely little tablet, you.</p>
<h2>Man's second-best friend (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6354d090c70ca"><a title="TEDDY" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6354d090c70ca/teddy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"What you doing, Dad?" — <em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think I've gone through quite as many milestones in life as I have during the Switch's lifespan. Okay, granted, not many console generations have lasted as long as the Switch, but whatever.</p>
<p>Soon after March 2017, I moved into my first house with my then-girlfriend, who became my wife a few years later. We got a dog (Teddy, who some of you will have met in a few Nintendo Direct liveblogs), created a brand-new human, moved into a bigger home, and I started working my dream job here at Nintendo Life. Honestly, I owe the Switch a great deal.</p>
<figure data-uuid="036c05beb3449"><a title="Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/036c05beb3449/switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the 3DS, which wooed me with its excellent custom designs, I've stuck to owning just one of each Switch variant: the OG, the Lite, and the OLED. The original has, until now, festered in the garage after I haphazardly threw it in a box whilst moving house, and unfortunately it no longer charges. A regrettable action on my part.</p>
<p>My Lite has pretty much already gone to my daughter, and while she's still not quite old enough to understand how it all works, it'll be there for her in the coming months and years. As for the OLED, I dunno... I suspect I'll keep it as a kind of backup; something to potentially test out GameShare features in the future, or something. I'm hesitant to let it go.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is... thank you, Switch. Nostalgia keeps the GameCube pretty high up on my list of favourite consoles, but there's no denying that the Switch is probably Nintendo's greatest achievement.</p>
<h2>So long, partner (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9880cdf03ad8f"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9880cdf03ad8f/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yes, that's how shocked I am that it's almost over — <em><span></span> Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It comes as a shock to almost everyone that I tell, but I didn't get my first Switch until Christmas 2017. I was in my first year of uni at the time and, unsurprisingly, I didn't have a lot of spare money lying around to be splashing on the latest Zelda machine. And so, I patiently waited until ol' Saint Nick came a-calling, while the lineup grew and grew.</p>
<p>Over the next three years of studying, the console brought some of my happiest memories: Wrapping up Breath of the Wild in my gross student bedroom rather than dwelling on homesickness; pulling an all-nighter with my housemates to finish a collaborative runthrough of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shaq-fu_a_legend_reborn">Shaq-Fu</a> (of all the games); sweating buckets with pals after a post-exams <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2021">Just Dance</a> party. The Wii was all about giving <em>everyone</em> the chance to play, and the Switch felt like it did it all over again.</p>
<p>That OG model, with its drifting Joy-Con and mysterious scratch on the back, got cashed in shortly after I started here at Nintendo Life and thought it only right to pick up a shiny new OLED to mark the occasion. I've kept this replacement in tip-top condition since, naturally, and will continue to do so long after my Switch 2 arrives.</p>
<p>It's only the threat of recency bias that keeps this wonderful hybrid from the top of my all-time favourite console list (where the DS currently sits), but I can see it sitting in pole position a few years down the line. So long, partner. You've been fantastic.</p>
<h2>An on, off, then fully-back-on-for-the-long-haul relationship (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f73b9ff24354c"><a title="OG Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f73b9ff24354c/og-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, my old mucker, which I haven't cleaned the dust off here for maximum effect. An ancient relic, this piece of early human history is actually my first Nintendo Switch (flanked by its siblings) and it still works. Probably. I'm not going to try it, just in case I release a curse and we have to get Brendan Fraser in (he's expensive since the Oscar).</p>
<p>Back in 2017, my mate got himself a Nintendo Switch and, for one of the first times ever, I decided to hold off a little on a new console launch, playing Breath of the Wild on my trusty Wii U, before finally realising I couldn't deal with the FOMO and capitulating. I then got very bored, very quickly. I'm not quite sure why — hard to remember anything that happened before COVID, innit — but I felt like the Switch wasn't going to be able to pull me away from shinier games on more powerful hardware. What a fool.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bunch of years and Switch, besides having given me a route — through freelance reviews — into my current full-time job at this lovely place, has easily become my favourite console of all time. So many great games, so many cherished family memories (my sons have grown up on Mario Kart 8 and Zelda, which I think we can all agree is the best start in life), it's been the final proof needed for me, as a (pro) gamer, that graphics, raw horsepower, and all that fancy stuff isn't what makes this medium really tick.</p>
<p>So, having said all of those very nice things, you'd think I'd <em>at least</em> be nice enough to dust it, after everything it's done for me. Why am I such a pig? A question for another time, perhaps.</p>
<h2>Gone with the drift (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c5b492959b006"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5b492959b006/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not sure where the biro across the Capture button on that blue Joy-Con came from — <em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've gone through three Switches in eight years. The first, a launch-day department store pickup, was donated to another family member when the better-battery version came out and I couldn't resist the tiniest of upgrades.</p>
<p>Then, when the OLED launched, I ended up swapping the better-battery one for my <em>original</em> launch-day Switch — the one I'd broken in with BOTW across four glorious weekend coach journeys throughout March '17 — which I've still got in the drawer. It's seen better days, and the rails don't hold the Joy-Con very well anymore (the same goes for my OLED), but it's still going.</p>
<p>I can't say what the future holds for them. It would be a shame for that OLED screen to go unused, but until my kids are older, these will probably stay in the drawer. One thing I <em>won't</em> be sad to see the back of is my drifting Joy-Con. I love the multicoloured lineup, but only two of the six pictured above function properly. Hmph.</p>
<p>But let's not let dodgy Joy-Con colour the memory of a little console that's become a part of the family. As with all family members, there's some crunchy with the smooth, but you wouldn't be without them. Goodnight, sweet Switch.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And there we are. We salute these Switches as we commit their tablets to the cupboard.</em></p>
<p><em>Will you be hanging up your S1 Joy-Con completely in a few days? Are you getting a little emotional about bidding this console farewell and getting involved with the new, shiny model? We'd love to hear your journeys with your personal Switches below.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026</a> slipped out of the top 10 (the latter out of the top 40 completely) to make room for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grand_theft_auto_v">GTA5</a>, both of which were hovering just outside last week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> moves down from #17 to #32, with over three-quarters of sales being for the Switch 2 Edition. And the Zeldas <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> are hanging in there at #37 and #40, respectively.</p>
<p>Here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1e704260b7671"><a title="2026 Predictions 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e704260b7671/2026-predictions-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, it seems like only yesterday we were looking ahead at Nintendo's 2025 with a sense of unwavering optimism, and now here we are – it's certainly been a year. The Switch 2 finally arrived, bringing with it a plethora of goodwill and controversy alike, ushering in a new generation that, if initial sales are anything to go by, might be one of Nintendo's most successful yet.</p>
<p>It's still early days, mind you, but we've no doubt that 2026 is going to be an equally busy year for Nintendo (and for us, too), so it's time we look ahead at the upcoming 12 months and see what might be in store.</p>
<p>Naturally, now that the big hardware release is out of the way, we're going to be focusing mainly on the <em>games</em> here, but we'll also throw a bone to Nintendo's non-gaming business, which seems to be ramping up more and more with each passing year.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:181925 @ 1767029536 -->
<p>So without further ado, let's live right in with a look at first-party Nintendo games...</p>
<h2>Switch 2 First-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e203fb172b109"><a title="2026 Predictions 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e203fb172b109/2026-predictions-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> I think it's about time we see <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-where-should-luigis-mansion-4-take-place">Luigi's Mansion 4</a></strong>, wouldn't you agree? It's been over six years since the third game, and given that it's sold nearly 15 million copies at this point, I think a new entry would be an easy win for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Then again, if Luigi's gets the spotlight, does that mean we go <em>another</em> year without a new 3D Mario? I'm not sure how I'd feel about that. I'm confident that Nintendo will reveal at least one of these in the coming months. I'd be equally thrilled with either, to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Gosh, despite a new console launching just six months ago, my expectations are relatively low. It'll be busy for third parties, but I think Nintendo will be skipping over its big anniversaries this year (Metroid, Zelda) with little more than a trailer or a remaster.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> think we might see something <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> related in 2026, whether that's a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">3</a>, or heck, even that patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">X</a>! And a teaser for a new game would be lovely, too. <strong>Pokémon Gen X</strong> <em>may</em> be on the cards, but with its usual release window hogged by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA VI</a>... I mean, the kids can play the 'mon while the parents have a new Rockstar game to get through</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong><strong>:</strong> Okay, let's get this one out right from the jump: we're not getting a Zelda in 2026, 40th anniversary be damned! Hmm, perhaps more accurately, I don't think we're getting a <em>new</em> Zelda in 2026. The next big 2D or 3D joint feels a couple of years away, <em>minimum</em>, so it's remake season, baby! I've given up holding out for that fabled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker_hd">Wind Waker</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess HD</a> port, so let's go for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games instead. Just don't touch my beloved Minish Cap.</p>
<p>Otherwise: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> DLC, a new <strong>Pikmin</strong>, and '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> 2'.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm gonna go ahead and suggest we could (or should) be looking at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> action in 2026. And I mean the full smorgasboard of paint-flinging multiplayer mayhem, not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders'</a> solo spin-off. It's been long enough since the superb third entry, and I'd love to see what the new graphical and CPU grunt of S2 could add to the equation.</p>
<p>I also wouldn't be surprised to see something from the vaults, like a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus</a> (one that people universally enjoy controlling) - yeah, that would have me foaming at the mouth, not gonna lie, but there's also plenty of scope for dream level stuff, too. Like a super-charged and graphically glorious return to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, now that Nintendo can go big on the graphics and maybe even deliver slick online options. <em>[Ha! - Ed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I imagine we'll see whatever the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_program">Playtest</a> turns out to be, but I'm hoping for that new 3D Mario to properly get the pulse racing. And for Zelda's 40th, it's the one we've all been waiting for:, the most ludicrous of NS2 Ed. titles, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Tingle's Toetown Hoedown</strong>.</p>
<p>Followed by <strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Fighters Pass Vol 3+4 <strong>+ Subspace Warpdash</strong> for the holidays. Yes, expanding titulature is a pillar of the Switch 2 generation.</strong></p>
<h2>Switch 2 Third-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f21258eeb1218"><a title="2026 Predictions 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f21258eeb1218/2026-predictions-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm sure <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is on everyone's card here, as it should be, and I would also love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> make the jump. Otherwise, I'm gonna go ahead and predict that we'll see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> arrive in a solid port that gets grief for being 30fps in handheld. I'd also suggest third-party racing games and sports games will make a much bigger impact now that a Switch console is capable of running them, so I wouldn't be surprised to see something like <strong>Forza</strong> (the next one <em>is</em> set in Japan).</p>
<p>Heck, maybe we might even have a sniff of something like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_galactic_racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wreckfest_2">Wreckfest 2</a> (or a bundle of some sort), or even the next entry in the <strong>F1</strong> series. Much to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I want ports-galore! Clair Obscur feels like the most open of open goals right now, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some smaller 2025 hits like Blue Prince and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">PEAK</a> make the jump — the latter with Mouse Mode climbing <em>and</em> GameChat? <em>Oof</em>. Let's throw <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> in there, too.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Starting off safe, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will release around six months after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Remake</a>, <em>and</em> we'll also see the third part of the trilogy. Maybe not day one Switch 2, but we'll see. Sticking with Square Enix, 2026 marks Dragon Quest's 40th anniversary. Can we really go <em>another</em> year without seeing <strong>Dragon Quest XII</strong>? I'm not sure, but I think this is the year to reintroduce it to the world.</p>
<p>Going a little leftfield, I really want to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/denshattack">Denshattack!</a> on Switch 2, and when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/"><strong>Fields of Mistria</strong></a> leaves Early Access, I <em>need</em> a port asap. And with the Yakuza train just continuing to roll, can we please have <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Like a Dragon</a>? I think it'll happen.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I love a good port as much as the next sailor, but I'd really like something I <em>haven't</em> already seen at a higher resolution and frame rate elsewhere. But that isn't very useful for a predictions piece, is it?...</p>
<p>Oh, let's say <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/immortality">Immortality</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/rez_infinite">Rez</a>. That's the stuff. And <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/phone/super_hexagon">Super Hexagon</a> at 4K, and with Switch 2's snazzy handheld audio, pulsing, pulsing..., yeah, that's it. C-mon, Tel, don't make me beg. Again.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> represent a clear indication that the Switch 2 is a viable console for so-called 'AAA' third-party games, so as much as I want to see a few ports (yes, Baldur's Gate 3), I'm keen to see completely new games. Neither <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> nor <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/bloodstained_the_scarlet_engagement">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</a> are confirmed for Switch 2 yet, but I'd be very surprised if they skipped Nintendo's console altogether.</p>
<p>Similarly, Capcom seems to be all-in with Nintendo, so it's possible that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/onimusha_way_of_the_sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> also gets a surprise confirmation at some point. Speaking of Capcom, the new <strong>Okami</strong> won't make 2026, but we'll see the first proper trailer and it'll be confirmed for Switch 2.</p>
<h2>Switch Online Additions</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7f3fe5ef02e44"><a title="2026 Predictions 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f3fe5ef02e44/2026-predictions-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> I've been very happy with the GameCube additions to Switch Online so far — a mix of big hitters a weirdo releases. But the biggest one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>, is weirdly absent. It <em>has</em> to happen in 2025, surely? With online functionality, 25 years after its release? What a way to push the Expansion Pack. Otherwise, I'll continue to beg for Pokémon games as long as my life depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I can see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_four_swords_adventures">Zelda: Four Swords Adventure</a> coming to a Switch 2 near you, and Mouse Mode feels like a great fit for DS games.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I've got a fancy new GameCube controller for my fancy almost-new Switch 2, and I'd bloody well like to use it, Nintendo. Specifically, I think we'd all have a great time if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/baten_kaitos_eternal_wings_and_the_lost_ocean">Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</a> showed up for NSO. Failing that, I'll take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/billy_hatcher_and_the_giant_egg">Billy Hatcher.</a></p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> Honestly, I'd be happy to just see <em>more</em> GameCube titles in 2026. Not just first-party games; let's get a few surprises in there. I'm thinking a Silicon Knights double-whammy with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metal_gear_solid_the_twin_snakes">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</a>, but I think it's also notable that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a> has yet to see a release on the Switch or Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> would be delightful, too.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> There's a part of me that's convinced Nintendo is working on a second-screen peripheral for that top USB-C port so we can get DS, 3DS and Wii U libraries on Switch 2. It feels like a long shot for 2026 — especially since the Virtual Boy is right around the corner — so I'll throw out my yearly wish for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Rogue Squadron</a> games on N64 and GameCube, too.</p>
<h2>What about Switch 1?</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d6fe313ad14a3"><a title="2026 Predictions 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6fe313ad14a3/2026-predictions-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> The original Switch will get a couple of new announcements beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a>. I'll keep bringing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">3</a> until it actually happens, and I think Nintendo would put them on Switch 1, too.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I agree with Ollie here, in that Metroid Prime 2 and 3 could work out really well on S1, and what a send-off that would be, especially if they could pad it out with a few new drops. I'll go ahead and suggest a new Pikmin could hit <em>both</em> Switches, alongside any new Mario.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> There's still life in the Switch 1, what with over 150 million units out there, and I think we'll continue to get games on the console over the next year. Largely, it'll be in the form of updates and patches that cater to both consoles, but we'll see.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I think we'll see more uses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-guide-how-to-share-games-locally-and-online">GameShare</a> from Nintendo. They may go back and add that functionality to a couple of games that are missing it, so families that have both consoles can play together. I think that'd be lovely!</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Honestly? The upcoming titles that we already know about might be the last of the <em>new</em> S1 releases. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven</a> feel like a particularly cosy note to end on, and I can't see any mega-busters heading to the old hardware now that Switch 2's in full swing.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The new Rhythm Heaven is legitimately the most exciting thing Nintendo has announced so far for 2026. Is there any point in releasing anything else first-party when you've got GOTY 2026 wrapped and bagged?</p>
<p>I <em>would</em> predict that I'll be picking up a bargain-priced Switch Lite for my collection when stores start selling off inventory cheap. But it seems that prices have skipped the end-of-gen dive and just keep going up. Therefore, the pile of unused hardware in the Billy bookcase won't be getting bigger anytime soon. Probably for the best.</p>

<p><strong>Jim:</strong> The <strong>Mario Galaxy</strong> movie will follow in its predecessor's steps and cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office, Nintendo Pictures has at least one more <strong>Pikmin</strong> short up its sleeve, and we'll get confirmation of a <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> TV series. We'll also see at least three new Nintendo mobile apps with near-identical red and white logos.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> A <strong>Zelda</strong> movie trailer is a given, right? As we've mentioned above, it's the 40th anniversary. That would be a big enough deal for Nintendo, and it's what the company did for Mario's big bash.</p>
<p>One thing I <em>think</em> is weird, given Ninty's big expansion into multimedia, is that we have no big TV show yet. So I think we're going to get one next year. Kirby? Animal Crossing? <em>A Kid Icarus show?</em> I don't know. But have your remotes ready.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> At this point, I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo announces another theme park, or maybe a smattering of new retail stores. The company appears to be really ramping up its visibility to the point of becoming the new Disney, and I'm all for it.</p>
<p>We'll also get <strong>New Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo XL</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I really didn't like the recent Mario movie, but I accept that it's probably not really aimed squarely at me. So, yeah, I guess that's gonna be the big obvious thing next year for Nintendo, another Jack Black video game movie (groan).</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Animal Crossing expansion for one of the theme parks, and an increase in quality merch like the stuff currently hitting My Nintendo Stores. I do like the look of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-reveals-new-line-of-metroid-merch-and-we-want-it-all">those Metroid ice trays</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/hardware_classics_pokemon_mini">Pokémon Mini</a> comes to NSO.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> As images and scientific data related to the interstellar object 3i/Atlas are studied in early 2026, it's discovered that the anomaly, only the third of its kind ever to pass through our galactic neighbourhood, is actually Starship Mario. It's all real.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> So, let's go back to my slight Metroid 40th anniversary dismissal and propose a remake — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>. I don't know if I want it, but by goodness, what a way to get people scrambling for joy. And shock. And maybe disappointment?</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> <strong>Star Fox</strong>. Yeah, I said it. The dream is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_fox_64">64</a> remake, natch, but if Nintendo wants to grace us with an all-new entry on a system where people will actually play it, you'll hear no complaints from me. 2026 is the year, I'm telling you!</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> It'll be <strong>Zelda</strong>'s 40th Anniversary in 2026, so Nintendo might surprise us with something special. How about a remake of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">original NES game</a>? Nothing groundbreaking, but maybe something akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_zero_mission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a> on the GBA. Keep it top-down with pixel art visuals, streamline it appropriately, and I'd buy it in an instant.</p>
