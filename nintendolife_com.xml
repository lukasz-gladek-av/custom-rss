<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> is coming out very soon — as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-arrives-on-switch-2-in-march">just announced</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> — but that's not the only upgrade coming to the 2023 GOTY-nominated platformer.</p>
<p>Three brand new amiibo will be released on the same day as the Switch 2 upgrade, <strong>26th March 2026</strong>. The line-up features Elephant Mario, Poplin &amp; Prince Florian, and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower. Yes! Captain Toad <em>finally</em> has an amiibo!</p>
<p>Prices haven't been announced yet, but given the increase as of the Switch 2 generation, they'll likely be on the more expensive side. Here's a little look at them:</p>

<p>What do they do in-game? They'll give you free power-up items if you scan them in while you're in any course.</p>

<p><em>Let us know what you think of the amiibo in the comments below</em>.</p>

<p>Rosalina Returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-has-been-rated">rating</a> earlier this month, Nintendo has today given us another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a>, accompanied by a release date of <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases a bunch of new features that will be arriving in the 2023 platformer. First up is the Game Room Plaza, a location for some multiplayer mayhem which will offer six different 'attraction' minigames to be played either locally or online with up to 12 people.</p>
<p>The Toad Brigade occupy a new area called 'Camp Central', where you can participate in training challenges to hone your skills, earn patches, and raise your Brigade ranking.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us another look at the Koopalings! These notorious baddies have stolen the Bellabel Flowers and scattered them across the map, so add that to the list of collectables as you make your way across the levels.</p>
<p>And speaking of familiar faces, Rosalina is available as a playable character in this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition! You can even control a Luma as a 'co-star' in co-op, where Mouse Mode is an option.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the trailer wraps up with the big reveal that three (yes, <em>three</em>) Wonder amiibo will be launching alongside the Switch 2 Edition on 26th March — Prince Florian fans, rise up!</p>
