<p>We're covering a generation a day until we've ticked off all nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1259245e69a92"><a title="Zelda NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1259245e69a92/zelda-nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all pulled a 'Wait, Mario is <em>how old??</em>' last year as the prized plumber and the NES celebrated their 40th anniversaries, and what do you know, we're about to do it all over again for little old Link.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> is 40 years old today (in Japan, at least). On <strong>21st February 1986</strong>, Nintendo introduced the world to the fantasy land of Hyrule, complete with legendary princesses, magical triangles, evil pig men, and a little boy in a green nightcap. It was the first time anyone had heard Koji Kondo's iconic title theme — apparently substituted in at the eleventh hour after Nintendo discovered Maurice Ravel's 'Boléro' wasn't up for grabs — or read the words "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this". Without it, many of our favourite games of all time simply would not exist. So yes, we think this is a birthday worth acknowledging.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>We've all heard the stories about Shigeru Miyamoto's inspirations for the game, as he set out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619152426/https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/06/19/415568892/q-a-shigeru-miyamoto-on-the-origins-of-nintendos-famous-characters">replicate the feeling of exploring the woods and caves outside of his childhood home</a> as a boy. And that's exactly what he did.</p>
<p>Nintendo's big player from the year before, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, was all about moving from left to right, something that vaguely resembled the 'quick fix' arcade experience for a new home console generation, the culmination of everything Nintendo had learned to that point.</p>
<p>Zelda was different. Launching with the Famicom Disk System (also 40 today), there was an open world at your disposal, items waiting in every dungeon, and rarely any set instruction to 'go here next". It's easy to overlook just how revolutionary and fresh the format was.</p>
<p>The story, by comparison, was something a little more familiar. Drawing inspiration from classic fairytales and high fantasy worlds established by the likes of Tolkien, Takashi Tezuka's story of good overcoming evil is a timeless one. An elf-like boy embarks on a quest to collect some magic rocks, overthrows a power-hungry prince, rescues the princess and restores peace to the land. We've all heard it before, but you can't knock its simplicity. And hey, did Tolkien ever write anything with a follow-up 'Second Quest' for those who have finished the first one? <em>Oh wait</em>...</p>
<figure data-uuid="1a7a7fd341391"><a title="Zelda NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a7a7fd341391/zelda-nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Remarkably, it still feels good today. We're not going to sit here and say that the original TLoZ packs quite the same open-world magic as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead</a> in 2026, but play any of them after experiencing this first slice of Hyrule, and you'll spot Nintendo's fingerprints everywhere.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's always been pretty easy to get your hands on the original game in the four decades since its launch. Be it through re-released GBA or GameCube packages, Virtual Consoles, Nintendo Switch Online, special edition Game &amp; Watches or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> retro systems, we've never been too far away from a way to dive into The Legend of Zelda, and every format will be someone's first.</p>
<p>And so, as we inflate our big '4' and '0' balloons, hang a banner, and let out a celebratory "HYYYYAAA", we thought we'd throw the reminiscing to you lovely lot. The Legend of Zelda has been playable in so many different forms, but which was your first experience with it?</p>
<p>We've listed each and every platform variant in the poll below, from the Famicom Disk System all the way up to NSO. Let's see where it started for everyone!</p>

<p>Hey everyone.<br>
This week I'm playing <strong>Gigasword</strong> on my S2 after my physical copy arrived.<br>
What an excellent game, the 8 bit art and sound is brilliant.<br>
A great Metroidvania that is a lot bigger and better than I expected, highly recommended.</p>
<p>Also playing <strong>Shadows of Mordor</strong> on my PS4 as well.</p>
<p>My <strong>Extreme Green Analogue 3D</strong> arrived this week so I'm going through my complete in box N64 games collection, all 243+ of them and adding each games individual settings that best suits each one.<br>
A huge undertaking but I'm loving it, I'm like a kid opening their N64 on launch day all over again.<br>
I've started alphabetically and just done A.<br>
<strong>Armorines</strong> is so much fun and it looks beautiful and plays so smoothly in overclocked mode.<br>
The Analogue tis a great machine and I've fallen back in love with my 64 collection.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend everyone.</p>

<p>Although I am continuing with Dragon Quest III 2D-HD, all of my gaming time has been consumed by Sword Of Fargoal on the C64 (via Evercade). It's a really fantastic RPG rogue-like, one of the first (1983). I have found the sword on several occasions, but escaping with it feels almost impossible! Caves Of Qud, Under The Island, and Calamity Angels also have my interest, so let's see how disciplined I can be this weekend! 😆 And then, of course... LeafGreen and FireRed next week! Oh my days. Have a great weekend, guys, and take great care of yourselves out there.</p></section>

<p>Greetings fellow video game enthusiasts. I have a cold but thankfully I've got my trusty new Switch 2 to keep me company. I've been playing Mario Kart World, it's really fun. I'd say Sonic Crossworlds is a better racing game but MKW is a better all round experience. Let's weekend.</p></section>

Going for 100%.<br>Besides that I’m playing through all 7 games in the <strong>Capcom Belt Action Collection</strong> with an American friend. The online is infinitely better than the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.</p><p>Beyond that I’m excited for <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> on Friday.</p></section>

<p>I'm some 45 hours in on Final Fantasy VII Remake for Switch 2. Amazing game! I'm also playing Virtual Boy with my new replica. Mostly Wario. Beyond playing a few demo units back in the day, it's the only Nintendo console I missed out on. I'm happy to get a chance to experience it now. It really was a wacky Nintendo system. I love it!</p><p>I'm planning to play some Metal Gear Solid 2 once I finish up with Final Fantasy. I'm in no hurry though.</p><p>Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend! 😊</p></section>

<p>Splitting my time between Donkey Kong Country 2 and Death Match Love Comedy mostly. Since Nintendo seems to be screwing around with the release of the latter (even though it's rated T) ended up grabbing the PS5 version.</p></section>

<p>I’m still neck deep into <strong>NiOh 3</strong>, working my way to the platinum trophy. It’s been such a tantalizing experience, and scratches that Elden Ring itch. By that, I mean its open world design. I prefer this approach to the genre because the difficulty of formidable bosses can be overwhelming. Being able to go somewhere else, explore, and level up gives you the feeling of always making strides to improvement.</p><p>That said, the final boss for the first region, <span title="Warning: Spoiler!">Takeda Shingen</span> was the bane of my existence. There were moments I contemplated whether or not victory was even fractionally possible. My death count was approximately 25 times, and my head hanged low before I had to go to work for the day. Prior to him, the (boss) fights had been challenging, but my confidence grew with each attempt. Nine hours later, I arrive home from work, and tell myself that I can beat him. Once again numerous deaths. And then I learned a pattern. Though I still died I was consistently getting him to the halfway mark. And then I learned another pattern. And another. Two attempts later, I beat him.</p><p>Sometimes, you just need to take a step back for a while. You have to realize that this is just a video game, and it can be beaten. Once I didn’t let the enemy frustrate me, toy with my emotions, and make me play defense, reacting for sheer survival rather than be offensive minded and focus on positioning, I knew I could do it. There is no other feeling like adrenaline. Subsequently, the next main boss I encountered I was victorious on the first attempt.</p><p>Meanwhile, during my lunch break at work, I read the news that <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X</strong> got a Switch 2 upgrade; I downloaded it as soon as I could. It’s nearly been a year since I’ve last played — I have forgotten the controls and sole core mechanics. I’m debating whether I want to start a fresh playthrough, or boot up my save file that has 120-hours logged, and get accustomed to the systems again. I will probably choose the latter, knowing I more than likely won’t finish it if I start anew.</p></section>

<p><strong>Dragon Quest 2 HD-2D Remake</strong>: Completed DQ1 in about 15.5 hours and have spent that same amount of time really just completing the first third of the sequel. It's cool how spells and abilities are divvied up between the party, of whom my favorite is definitely Matilda for her feisty passion and witticisms. The already gorgeous visuals are improved even further and the scope is quite impressive (seeing the entire first game's map fit into roughly one-quarter of this one gives you an idea how much bigger of a game this is). Looking forward to closing out the Erdrick trilogy in style.</p>

<p><strong><u>Assassin's Creed Shadows</u></strong><br>Rolled credits at Level 55. Feel a bit burnt out to go for the platinum so I'll put this down for a bit and come back sometime later. Not as good as Origins, Odyssey, or Valhalla IMO. B-Tier.</p><p><strong><u>Euro Truck Simulator 2</u></strong><br>Delivered an excavator to Jönköping. After 102 days my Ziggurat Spedition trucking empire has 43 trucks.</p><p><strong><u>Everything</u></strong><br>Have reached the point where I'm just letting the game autoplay to mop up trophies so I guess I should move on. Interesting concept, average game. Could be more interesting in VR. B-Tier.</p><p><strong><u>Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster</u></strong><br>Have acquired the airship and am doing some side quests to level up prior to progressing the story.</p><p><strong><u>Hollow Knight</u></strong><br>Haven't picked this up in a few months so wandering around the Forgotten Crossroads to refamiliarise myself with the controls while grinding for geo to buy some more charms, mask shards, and vessel fragments. Bought the Gathering Swarm charm.</p><p><strong><u>PowerWash Simulator VR</u></strong><br>Doing the second job in the back yard. Only playing for 30 mins at a stretch so its going to take some time to work through this.</p><p><strong><u>The Outer Worlds</u></strong><br>Completed the main quests and all side quests in Emerald Vale.</p></section>

<p>I'm at my boyfriends playing nurse joy for the weekend. So I'll probably play the Skyward sword I picked up cheap with a Loftwing two weeks ago.</p><p>I've been hating on this game because I hate fire and desert worlds...and that's 2/3 of the game. But let's play again and find some things to love about it!</p></section>

<p>Having acquired the replica Virtual Boy I'm hoping to play some more Galactic Pinball and 3D Tetris - took some getting used to the peculiar setup with lots of red and 3D effects (plus I already have a bad back before playing the thing) but these were both fun to play. Will try to dig into some of the other titles too, although I really want them to hurry up and release Zero Racers soon. Happy gaming all!</p></section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Raccoonius" data-username="Raccoonius" rel="nofollow">@Raccoonius</a> Ha ha indeed and I can't help it, so many games I'm interested in playing and/or replaying (the latter especially if I've never finished or completed them before) - that said, playing a single or few games at a time is also perfectly fine and has the advantage of letting you play them faster!<br>
<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/PinderSchloss" data-username="PinderSchloss" rel="nofollow">@PinderSchloss</a> It's worth mentioning that I have specific slots each day, in the morning when I wake up dedicated to the games I use to exercise, after dinner and before sleeping for the rest (and of course also the schedule of my YouTube channel, those curious about it can find the link in my profile here on Nintendo Life), and I play them for only around 1 or at most 2 hours each, that certainly helps to avoid it being exhausting - anyway, thank you and it's the perfect way for me as much as I appreciate the benefits of playing one or few games at a time as abovementioned!</p>

<p>This weekend is all about <strong>Hyrule Warriors AoI</strong> for me. Pretty good game! At first I was sure the type of game wasn't for me, and I was about to sell it and get Mario Tennis instead lol. But after the "plot twist" (I already knew about it, but still), the next quest won me over. Now, with more tension and more playable characters, things are getting interesting!</p><p>I hope I can finish the game by the time <strong>Resident Evil 9</strong> comes out. I already have the Generations Pack preordered! And I finally bought <strong>Trails in the Sky remake</strong>, it should be coming over by Wednesday, so I'm going to be busy lol. Good times!</p><p>Happy gaming, everyone!</p></section>

<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong><br>Finished the game about an hour ago. There were some slower moments in the last few chapters but the final set of bosses was fun. I did most of the side content but the logs show that there's still more. I think I'm good. I'll play INTERmission but maybe a bit closer to June when Rebirth comes out.</p><p><strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong><br>At the entrance to Shinra building. I'll play it up to the ending of Remake and leave it there for now.</p><p><strong>Rhythm Paradise/Heaven</strong><br>Finished the game last week. 37 superbs, 14 perfects. I want to at least get all superbs.</p><p><strong>The Messenger</strong><br>Started this morning. First couple of stages done. Movement is smooth. I like the extra jump from hitting stuff. Shopkeeper seems like a nice guy. Has fun stories to tell.</p></section>

<p>With this being Zelda’s 40th anniversary, I’ll try to make meaningful progress in Tears of the Kingdom instead of the aimless wandering I’ve done in areas where enemies can easily one-shot me. It’s about time I get things going!</p><p>I still need to start playing my Virtual Boy accessory. I’m playing Splatoon 3 for Salmon Run as well as a run up Side Order because it’s also the 2nd anniversary of Side Order. I’ve still got more to do in Peach Showtime. I don’t need my sister’s borrowed copy anymore because I recently bought the game for half the price myself thanks to a digital sale on Amazon.</p></section>

<p>Finished Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership (god it was long). Borrowed The Thing Remastered from library and going to check it out. I have pre-ordered Fatal Frame 2 and RE Requiem of course is on my list but it's just too expensive right now. Really want to re-play XCX too with the S2 upgrade.

<p>I'll continue building my new island in <strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong> for the Switch 2. I bought <strong>Under the Island</strong> and love it so far so i'll play that one too.</p><p>I'm eying another purchase on the e-Shop this weekend, i just don't know what game it will be just yet, but i'm sure i'll find something good to buy and play.</p><p>Happy gaming folks. I hope all of you will have a great weekend filled with all the things you wanna do.</p></section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/JohnnyMind" data-username="JohnnyMind" rel="nofollow">@JohnnyMind</a> Thanks. I remember I had Link's Awakening back in 1995, but I never got to finish the game before I lost it. It's neat to be back at it, 31 years later, and I'm enjoying it so far. Reminds me of back then, but not enough to spoil it for myself by my past self (don't really remember much, so it's like a blind playthrough).</p></section>

<p>I'm playing Binky's Trash Service, Rayman Redemption, Gran Turismo 3, Tres-Bashers, Banjo, Mario Bros, Link's Awakening, Airframe Ultra demo (I'm loving the bouncy physics with jet moto futuristic bikes, and it seems locked at 90fps in handheld), Super Battle Golf (easily locks at 90 once I reduced resolution and settings, super fun!), Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh (thanks Time Extension for heads up about English patch!), Megaman in the Mushroon Kingdom, and a bunch of incredible mods for several games. I'm also still blown away by the River Master releases, mostly still listening to Angler's Dream.<br>Enjoying videos of Gamer's Nexus, Macho Nacho Productions (the Zelda game and watch mod is amazing), and Nerrel's new video about art and remakes.</p></section>

<p>More of the same for me! Meaning I’ll keep chipping away at wild zones and quests in Legends ZA, which I’m having fun with but also going slowly through. I’ll also probably do some ranked matches in Fever, and maybe a post game mission or two in Age of Imprisonment. Happy gaming all!</p></section>

<p>More big snow on the way Sunday night (I am so done with this winter) so I'll be distracted somewhat, but I’ll play a little more <strong>Tennis Fever</strong> and no doubt a few more puzzles in <strong>Sega Picross</strong>.</p><p>I should probably add that last weekend I thrifted and found a retro rattan TV stand upon which to put my retro CRT TV and retro top-loader NES to play some retro NES games. Yes, I’ve decided to try and rebuild some of my long-lost 8- and 16-bit collection from the 80s/90s, starting with the ‘ol Nintendo. I’m planning to play some <strong>Jackal</strong> this weekend, that old “desert rat” style, top-down jeep shooter from Konami. It’s a nostalgia trip plugging in that big chunky cartridge and hearing that box TV hum. Just change it to channel 3 and away we go!</p><p>Wishing all NL friends a fun weekend with your favorite pursuits! 🕹️👾🛻</p></section>

<p>I got tired of grinding out to end game monsters in <strong>Final Fantasy X HD</strong> and took it to its conclusion, rolling over the main story bosses with little resistance. I like extras, but I felt like it was really starting to disrespect my time with the minigames...</p><p>I moved on to <strong>Dragon Quest III 2D-HD Remake</strong> for a bit of that comfort food type experience. It's been a stressful month and going back to simpler times (with QoL to smooth over the irritating bits we forgot). It's nice so far, bot heavens to Murgatroyd that text font is <strong>tiny</strong>.</p><p>Also some <strong>Dorfromantik</strong> for a calmer time as needed.</p><p>Happy gaming everyone!</p></section>

<p>I’ll be playing on some Overwatch here and there, still learning the new heroes and still trying to avoid the falling wall climber-like jet pack cat that can swoop down and carry you off to a pit. I’m also thinking of pulling out my nes and playing some festers quest or maybe blaster master with the joystick controller.</p>

<p>Hello again, y'all! This weekend I'm playing:</p><p><strong>Switch</strong>:<br><strong>Dragon Quest XI S Echoes of an Elusive Age Definitive Edition</strong>: since last weekend, I have obtained a few more party members and orbs. My next objective is to <span title="Warning: Spoiler!">craft another Sword of Light</span>.<br><strong>Animal Crossing New Horizons</strong>: I am officially done with hotel stuff now. Also, I should be able to afford the final house storage upgrade sometime very soon.<br><strong>Switch and mobile</strong>:<br><strong>Hello, Mario!</strong>: I've messed around with this a bit on both my Switch and my smartphone. It's incredibly fun to just mess around with. Probably not something I will touch or mention often, but for a free app, it's definitely worth keeping around.</p></section>

<p>Two platform backlogs growing bigger yet this week, but while the Switch library gains (including Newt One, Breathedge, Jack Move and two more Bendy games) are more abundant, they're also going to wait at least until I'm through with the Wreckfest career while Deck should see some actual weekend action in Warriors of the Nile, a tactical roguelite that somehow never followed its sequel Switchward. The OG hybrid, on the other hand, got two regions' worth of Virtual Boy installed (the Japanese version grabbed just in case although the launch lineup is identical); the unequipped experience is predictably squintworthy but not unenjoyable, and the arcade horror of Innsmouth no Yakata is particularly neat to see as yet another retro title getting some belated westside presence courtesy of the Classics apps. That said, what time I may spend with said apps this weekend will likely be focused on a salad of Zelda II, Yoshi's Island, Zero Mission and MK64 instead.</p><p>Retaining their fair session odds are also the other Switch "salads" (the usual franchise-spanning ones - Xenoblade, Tales, Persona, Atelier, Castlevania, My Time...) alongside other stuff from FFXII, RE0, Unsighted and Hero's Hour to Caravan Sandwitch, Swords of Ditto, Knight Witch and Dysmantle. More Zelda across BotW and EoW is also possible, as is the other aforementioned franchise engagements spilling over to other platforms like 3DS and Vita (which also have other content odds ranging from Endless Frontier and Chase Begins to VLR and Neptunia). Even PS4 might just elbow in with some New Order and/or Drake's Fortune.</p></section>

<p>Still making my way through DQ7 and thoroughly enjoying it. Filling time with Mario Tennis Fever in-between.</p>
<p>Im tempted to play something space orientated so Ive been toying with either a new playthrough of Mass Effect or Starfield on PC.</p>
<p>Probably best to hold that thought as I can't wield too many RPGs at once.</p>

<p>For the next backlog game, I decided to really pull something way out of left field. After 27 years I'm going to give <strong>Final Fantasy 8 Remastered</strong> (Switch 2) another go. Back in the 90's, I fully admit I was one of those Final Fantasy 7 tourist/bandwagon players. I tried FF8 when it came out and quickly realized that genre is not for me. Since the remastered release it's always nagged just a little in the back of my mind. Let's see if I can see it all the way through this time.</p></section>

<p>Much like last week, Dragon Quest 7. Too many things keep happening consecutively in the game but I have to make myself stop. 35 hours in plus my characters are levelling up nicely. Great game. Trying to be careful what I say so I don’t spoil it for people who are earlier into the story.</p>

<p>Finished Metroid prime 4. It was a good game overall. I liked it better then first one for the most part but I still didn’t like the NPCs in Metroid prime 4 but it didn’t ruin the game for me much. They were just in there too much is my problem. Hopefully they do a part 5 but I would rather they just make the other Metroid games.</p><p>Trails in the sky FC remake switch 2 - did some quests and am in the town where I am sure a lot takes place in chapter 2.</p><p>Cronos the new dawn(switch 2) - making some progress. Trying to save as much ammo and stuff as I can lol.</p><p>Final fantasy 7 remake(switch 2) - in chapter 9 now. I know this is a big chapter so it will take me a while.</p><p>Happy gaming everyone!</p></section>

<p>Playing:</p><ul><li><strong>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</strong> - Between the <strong>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</strong> announcement, listening to the soundtrack at work, and dying to know more about Fódlan's lore, I've started a second run. This time on Golden Deer/Verdant Wind. I enjoyed my Blue Lions/Azure Moon run last year but felt it left a lot of hanging threads in exchange for its more character focused plot. NG+ is definitely a godsend when it comes to the Monastery sections. I'm not far - only on Chapter 3 - but I know I'm in for another fun run. </li><li><strong>Paper Mario</strong> (Wii U VC) - Still enjoying this charming game on the side. I plan to jump into Chapter 6 as soon as I wrap up some side business I didn't realize was available, namely the Koopa Koot requests and unlocking warp pipes in the Toad Town tunnels. </li></ul><p><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</strong> was the other JRPG under consideration. I settled on <strong>Three Houses</strong> before the Switch 2 edition announcement, but now I think I'll wait to play XCX until I nab a Switch 2.</p><p>Happy gaming!</p></section>

<p>Happy Weekend and gaming everyone. And Happy Zelda's 40th anniversary. And Happy week of Pokemon 30th anniversary. This week I have been playing;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bloodstained_curse_of_the_moon"><strong>Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon</strong></a> - I finished a first run through and now am replaying on the harder difficulty. I love the variety of characters in this game.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/qomp2"><strong>qomp2</strong></a> - I grabbed on a good sale. This is a game about the pong ball escaping and going on an adventure. Some of the puzzles are tricky; I'm still early game but it is quite good so far.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mr_run_and_jump"><strong>Me Run and Jump</strong></a> - Another great sale. Similar vibe to qomp2 even though this one is a traditional precision Platformer. The variety of jumps with just 2 buttons is impressive - long jump, wall jump, high jump, double jump, ball roll, parabolic air dash. It's a simple game but quite well put together.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure"><strong>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</strong></a> - Moppu is max level! Now I'm back to events and waiting for 3 visitors to arrive.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong></a> -Season 7 just started so I'm back to multiplayer. The multiplayer for this game has gotten even more silly over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I will boot up a Zelda game also in honor of the anniversary.</p>

<p>When they said they found a 60 fps code in the game last year I was a little intrigued but I was still going to play through the game to finally see the real ending. But they talked about switch games getting updates on switch 2 that would make them run better. So I kind of stopped playing it. Hoping for an update especially since other 7 and 8 year old games were getting updates. Now waiting has paid off. I was only 4 hours in so I am started fresh. I am loving playing this game again over 10 years later. The 60 fps and better visuals do look nice even if the is pretty much a remaster with added things.</p></section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/the_beaver" data-username="the_beaver" rel="nofollow">@the_beaver</a> I’m loving it. I think it’s better than Aces. There’s more content, bigger roster, and more modes. The gameplay is solid and the fever rackets are a decently fun gimmick.</p></section>

<p>I'm not sure. I finished playing <strong>Naruto: Path of Ninja</strong> on DS and finished reading <strong>My Hero Academia</strong>. <br>People are getting sick in my house. I'm probably next, so I'm hesitant to start a new game. But maybe I'll get lucky and skip it. We'll probably play more <strong>Highguard</strong>. I don't know. I don't like getting sick lol.</p></section>

<p>Tonight, the Spearess and I are going out for dinner, so I'll just continue with my schedule of alternating between:</p>
<p><strong>Civilization VI</strong> (Still on the Trajan/Roman Empire revenge tour. I was gaining momentum toward a culture/tourism victory when the AI civs began banning my rock bands. They're currently headed overseas to resume work on friendlier soil. This may require some military help.;<br>
<strong>Balatro</strong> (Hundreds of hours after completing C++, this game still sinks its claws into me two or three times a week. I won a couple of runs last night.);<br>
<strong>Cast n Chill</strong> (I think I need seven or so fish to finish up. I’ve finished the log book for almost every fish I’ve caught, so I’m very close to completion, save for a few achievements.);<br>
<strong>SteamWorld Dig</strong> (I started this on Wii U many years ago but got sidetracked. Went back last night but hit the dreaded Wii U memory error. I've prepared for this day and will get to work on reviving my Wii U, but I just went ahead and restarted the game on Switch.<br>
<strong>Bejeweled Twist</strong> (I've gotten back into this DS gem. I long ago had a Zen game up to about 75 or 80 million points, only to have the save file glitch and knock the score back to 1 million or so. In the past week or so I've built it back up to 11 million (one higher than 10), and am adding maybe 250K or 500K a day.</p>
<p>Happy gaming, everyone!</p>

<p><strong>Bowser's Fury</strong><br>Bilewater was getting under my skin a bit, so I've elected to take a break from Silksong for 1-2 days and I figure I'll play through Bowser's Fury on Switch 2 to do that.</p><p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <br>If I feel up to it, I'll play tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Mario Kart World</strong> and <strong>Kirby Air Riders</strong><br>As per usual, I'll probably play a few online matches.</p><p>Happy gaming, everyone!</p></section>

<p>Still working on unicorn overlord, and some Pokemon y on the side. Got some games in the mail from VGP, hundred line and Pokemon moon, so excited for those but won’t start them yet. The xenoblade x resurgence in popularity is awesome to see but I finished it on my switch 2 already and don’t need to check back in just yet</p></section>

<p>This weekend, I'll be playing...</p><p><strong>Hollow Knight</strong> - I just can't stop playing it. I made quite a lot of progress, and I unlocked a couple new areas last time I played. I'm expecting to face the next boss soon. This game is real tough at times... but it's been keeping me coming back for more.</p><p><strong>Super Mario Galaxy 2</strong> - Still enjoying my replaythrough on the Switch. Been getting more stars.</p><p><strong>Disney Dreamlight Valley</strong> - As much as I love Animal Crossing, I'm getting a little burnt out from it, so I'll be playing this. I have yet to play it on Switch 2, which is supposed to run a bit better on it. Good game to play before my trip to Disney World, as well!</p><p>I'll probably play other games like <strong>Mario Kart World</strong>, but haven't decided yet. I did start <strong>Mega Man III</strong> (the Game Boy one) on Nintendo Classics yesterday, too.</p><p>I hope you're all doing well. Be good, and happy gaming! <i title=":heart:"></i> <i title=":smiley:"></i></p></section>

<p>To those who have played <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X</strong> - is it an accessible game for the more casual gamer? I’m looking for a new open world game to sink my teeth into, and this may scratch that itch 🤔</p></section>

<p>Lol at seeing Virtual Boy games in the poll responses! I'm "enjoying" this crappy system for the first time too 😅 Enjoying it in a campy pop culture history sort of way. But it's just too rough on my eye muscles to play for more than 10-15 mins at a time.</p><p>Otherwise, I picked up a copy of WWE 2K25 for $15, and I'm really enjoying it! I've never played one of these games before. And as long as you don't touch any DLC or microtransactions, it seems like a pretty great value with a lot of diverse content/ways to play. I'm trying to wrap my brain around MyGM currently.</p></section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Nightcrawler71" data-username="Nightcrawler71" rel="nofollow">@Nightcrawler71</a> <br>From someone who's played all the Xenoblade games X should be ok for casual gaming as it kinda lets you play at your own pace. The battle system is a bit complicated though but was able to get by using the basics.</p></section>

<p>Still plugging away at Pokemon Legends Z-A, which I think I've nearly finished. There's a lot to like about the game, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't getting a bit bored of Lumiose City... Now that I've got my Labo VR out of its cupboard I might play some Virtual Boy Wario Land as well.</p><p>By the way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/KateGray" data-username="KateGray" rel="nofollow">@KateGray</a> I just thought I should say you don't need a Switch 2 for the new Tomodachi Life, it's a Switch 1 game!</p></section>

<p>Don't really have any games in particular for this weekend as catching up on shows and the Olympics but I did beat Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and the game is great. It does have some pacing issues though but overall a great reimagining of a classic game.</p></section>
