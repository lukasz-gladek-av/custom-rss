<p>Rosalina, Bowser Jr. and..?</p>

<figure data-uuid="e27b95019ca98"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e27b95019ca98/super-mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Illumination</em></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the Sonic movies, the Mario movies are expanding their big-screen universe by introducing and surprising audiences with more characters. Mario's companion Yoshi was teased at the end of the first movie, and since then, the official trailers for the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong> have introduced Bowser Jr. and Rosalina.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-s-appearances-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-chris-pratt-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-people-should-be-excited/">GamesRadar+ recently</a>, Mario's movie voice actor Chris Pratt has apparently hinted there are at least "a couple more" characters not featured in the official trailers for the new movie that should excite fans. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, yes, there are," Pratt tells GamesRadar+ when we ask if there are any new characters he's looking forward to seeing in the finished film. "I'm not allowed to say what they are, but yes, there are some really incredible… Well, I think some of them have been released in the trailer – Rosalina, Bowser Jr. – and then there's even a couple more that are not in the trailer that people should be excited to see."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Pratt is teasing a bigger cast of characters, there are plenty of friendly and not-so-friendly characters from the Mario video game universe that could pop up. One rumoured leak, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52847-rumor-more-characters-revealed-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">dating back to last September</a>, has led to speculation that Wario could be making an appearance.</p>
<p>You can see the current cast for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie in our guide. Nintendo and Illumination have also confirmed Rosalina will be voiced by Brie Larson and Bowser Jr. will be played by Benny Safdie.</p>

<p>Including multiple fixes for Mega Dimension</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c7c6076c5421f"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7c6076c5421f/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has received its first update of the year today for the Switch and Switch 2. When you download it, your copy will be updated to Version 2.0.1.</p>
<p>It focuses on some adjustments for obtaining certain items (including an increase to the maximum number of Mega Shards) and also applies a whole bunch of fixes to previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> expansion issues. You can read more about this in a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71193/kw/pokemon%20legends%20z-a%202.0.1">separate post</a> on Nintendo's support site.</p>
<p>Here's the rundown of this latest update:</p>
<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released January 21, 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Adjustments Applied for Obtaining Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When purchasing Berries from a food stall, you can now purchase multiple Berries at once.</em></li>
<li><em>After beginning the story of the Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension DLC, you will be able purchase Berries from the clerk at Nouveau Café’s Truck No. 3.</em></li>
<li><em>The maximum number of Mega Shards you can carry has been increased from 999 to 9,999.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Applied for the Following Confirmed Issues Related to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</em> Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When using moves in certain pockets of hyperspace, Pokémon may sometimes have faced a different direction from the intended target.</em></li>
<li><em>There were cases in which the weather remained sunny and did not change.</em></li>
<li><em>Shiny Pokémon obtained prior to the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension may not have been registered to the Mega Evolution Pokédex, even if their Mega Stones were obtained after becoming available in the DLC.</em></li>
<li><em>During missions, images from unrelated scenes may occasionally have been displayed.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may not have been able to complete side mission 188 “Start Special Scanning!” even after earning the maximum number of survey points. (Players who are already experiencing this issue should be able to progress after entering and exiting hyperspace.)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In case you missed it, the Mega Dimension expansion DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A released at the end of last year. Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to our expectations here at Nintendo Life, with repetitive Hyperspace dimensions and bland level design, but it's hard to resist the lure of an expanded Pokédex.</p>
<p>You can find out what else we had to say about it in our full review:</p>

<p>Nintendo has also released new updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> today, and yesterday rolled out a surprise update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</a> remake will no longer see the light of day after the company announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a> this week.</p>
<p>Alongside this news, the team working on the game has issued a message explaining the reason behind this "difficult decision". Although the project had "real potential", it seems the developer was unable to reach a certain "level of quality" that would meet player expectations.</p>
<p>And while Ubisoft is done with this particular project, it doesn't necessarily mean it's leaving the Prince of Persia universe or legacy behind. Here's the message via social media (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/prince-of-persia-remake-team-shares-final-message-following-games-cancellation">thanks for the heads up, Pure Xbox</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fhlpiyk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the Prince of Persia community, we want to share this with you directly.</p>
<p>We've made the difficult decision to stop development on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake. We know this is deeply disappointing. The game carries enormous meaning for fans and for the team who worked on it.</p>
<p>While the project had real potential, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn't want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia as a universe and legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we're stepping away from the franchise.</p>
<p>Thank you for your passion, patience, and love for Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>- The Prince of Persia Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we've already highlighted, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">new operating model will focus on five "creative houses"</a>, which are responsible for key franchises. CH4 will work on narrative adventures, and listed here is the Prince of Persia series alongside IP such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyond_good_and_evil_20th_anniversary_edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</p>
<p>So, the Prince of Persia series is back on ice for now, but it could still return at some point in the future, in some way or form. If you are eager to experience <em>something</em> in this series, you could always try out the excellent roguelite sidescroller <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, which was released on the eShop late last year.</p>
<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake was originally announced at an Ubisoft Forward event in 2020 and suffered multiple delays up until its cancellation.</p>

<figure data-uuid="11af1244f7a70"><a title="Samus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11af1244f7a70/samus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Kensuke Tanabe, veteran producer at Nintendo who became known for his work on the <strong>Metroid Prime</strong> series, has reportedly announced his retirement.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">VGC</a>, Tanabe's announcement comes via an interview with the Japanese magazine <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/">Nintendo Dream</a>, which has been uploaded online by a user on <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574">Weibo</a>. Tanabe states that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> was to be his final game at the company, with his protégé producer Risa Tabata succeeding him should another Prime game be made in the future.</p>
<p>Tabata's first game with Nintendo was, coincidentally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> on the GameCube. She has since worked as an assistant producer on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/donkey_kong_country_returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/paper_mario_color_splash">Paper Mario: Color Splash</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">The Thousand-Year Door</a> on Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cejmrqxn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As for Tanabe, he reportedly states in the interview that he had wanted to create a Metroid title focused on Samus and Sylux since dropping subtle hints in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Prime 3: Corruption</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>. Realising that Prime 4: Beyond might be his last shot to do this, he decided to make it the first entry in the Sylux saga.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I envisioned Sylux as a dark, resentful villain who resorts to underhanded tactics. After this game, Samus would realize that a direct confrontation with him is inevitable – she must defeat him completely.</p>
<p>“That’s why the final showdown between Sylux and Samus remains unfinished. However, completing this game took far longer than anticipated.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanabe leaves behind a remarkable legacy at Nintendo. His first game with the company was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> in 1987 during which he served as director. Since then, he's transitioned into one of the most prominent producers at the company, working on everything from <strong>Luigi's Mansion</strong> to <strong>WarioWare</strong> and beyond, and we're certain he will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Tanabe-san.</p>
