Square Enix's hotly anticipated tactical RPG has marched onto Switch and Switch 2 today, and it's getting launched in style thanks to some rather swanky new art.</p>
<p>The first piece comes from Akihiko Yoshida himself — a long-time Final Fantasy artist and the man behind the box art for The Ivalice Chronicles. As shared by the <a href="https://x.com/FFT_TIC/status/1972858946341015611">official FF Twitter account</a>, the new illustration shows game heroes Mustadio, Ramza, Agrias, Delita, and Orlandeau, standing against a gloomy hand-drawn background.</p><div><figure data-videoid="KK3nTYgZ9yY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6205b9souqyl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>It may not be the most celebratory-looking piece we've ever seen, but it sure is dramatic:</p>

<p>And that's not all! The Ivalice Chronicles is a big deal, and to prove it, Square Enix artist Yasushi Hasegawa has created a <a href="https://x.com/TRST_PR/status/1972679296948052230">special crossover</a> piece with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">TRIANGLE STRATEGY</a>, showing the two tactical RPG protagonists in a friendly handshake. We particularly like the mini grid-based sprites in the background — just look at those little guys!</p>

<p>It's some great art for a great game. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, the wonderful PJ O'Reilly described The Ivalice Chronicles as "a fantastic — and fantastically thoughtful — revamp", serving up "one of the all-time great tactical RPGs looking and playing better than ever".</p>

<figure data-uuid="30c0e42f95afc"><a title="RE Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30c0e42f95afc/re-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced for the Switch 2, we must admit to being a little surprised that the game could conceivably run well on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>We weren't the only ones either. According to a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53825">Famitsu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">wccftech</a>), director Koshi Nakanishi said that the development team itself was also surprised at how well Requiem ran on the Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>To begin with, this game is made to be fairly scalable. We've been making it by adjusting various options so that it can be compatible with a wide range of specs, from high to relatively low, so the Switch 2 can be optimized to suit the specs quite smoothly.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>"We haven't tried to force something made for high-end performance to slow down, but have assumed a variety of spec conditions in advance. Even we were surprised when we first saw it, how beautifully it ran. I think it was thanks to the engine team's hard work that it ran so smoothly.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, our recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">hands-on time</a> with Requiem revealed that the game has been remarkably optimised for the Switch 2. Playing at TGS 2025, Lowell Bell said that it "has broken me of that Nintendo stigma that third-party blockbusters can’t run on their hardware".</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is currently scheduled to launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. If that's not enough, native ports of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> will also land on the same day. The series will be celebrating its 30th anniversary next year, so we're expecting to see even more big things from Capcom's survival horror behemoth in the months to come.</p>

<p>"I find myself torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="14da3b0318c97"><a title="FF7 Remake - Cloud" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14da3b0318c97/ff7-remake-cloud.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> will finally make its way onto the Switch 2 early next year on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>For many, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">1997 original</a> stands as one of the most iconic games of all time, and it's certainly up there as one of the best entries in the long-running series. For Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of the Remake Trilogy (of which the latter two entries have also been confirmed for Switch 2), tackling such a monumental project comes with its own sense of pressure.</p>
<p>Speaking via an <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-interview">internal interview at Square Enix</a>, Hamaguchi-san says that he finds himself "torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis", but nevertheless finds the whole thing a "worthwhile challenge" to undertake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Final Fantasy VII has always been a special game for me. When it was originally released, I was simply another player immersed in it and I was strongly drawn to the story of Cloud and Sephiroth. The game opened my eyes to the power of storytelling, something that’s stayed with me ever since. I feel it’s still at the core of what I do as a creator.</p>
<p>"I am now in the position of where I interact with Final Fantasy VII on the creative side and am working hard to bring Remake Intergrade to multiple new platforms and deliver the FFVII experience to even more people. I’m also right in the middle of developing the third and final part of the trilogy, the final phase where we bring the series to an epic conclusion - and a fitting culmination of everything in Final Fantasy VII.</p>
<p>"Because Final Fantasy VII is a game that fans have such a strong attachment to, I find myself torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis. I feel a great responsibility to get it right. However, I believe this also makes it a worthwhile challenge to take on.</p>
<p>"Personally, I feel that the essence of Final Fantasy VII is the freedom to mix together many different elements and not get caught up in the restrictions of a single genre. How to bring that to the current generation is the challenge I’ve set myself at the moment."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the reception so far, we reckon Hamaguchi-san and his team have been doing a pretty good job on the trilogy. If you've not played Remake yet, you're in for a treat when it lands early next year. It seems that it'll run remarkably well on Nintendo's new console too, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman recently stating that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">"the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2"</a>.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and the untitled third entry, there's no indication as to when they'll release on the Switch 2, but you can bet we'll be keeping a close eye on any potential developments in the coming months.</p>

<p>Nintendo recently kicked off Mario's 40th anniversary, and it appears other companies are joining in on the celebrations.</p>
<p>One of them happens to be First 4 Figures, with the "high end" collectible maker announcing its Mario and Yoshi statue (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/03/pre-orders_for_mario_and_yoshi_statue_go_live_on_first_4_figures_website">which we previously covered here on Nintendo Life</a>) is now back in production - with standard, exclusive and definitive editions available to pre-order.</p>
<p>The definitive edition also comes with the bonus Bowser Checkpoint Flag and is priced at $749.99 / £558.03. The standard edition starts at $549.99 / £409.22, and the exclusive edition will set you back $599.99 / £446.42. There's also an early bird special if you place an order before 13th October 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Calling all Super Mario fans! We're thrilled to announce that we will be heading back into production to complete the edition size of our Mario and Yoshi statue, featuring the Standard, Exclusive, and Definitive versions!"</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="ca458c34b943b"><a title="Mario and Yoshi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca458c34b943b/mario-and-yoshi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: First 4 Figures, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Apart from this, this week marks the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> for the Switch. Nintendo is also celebrating Mario's 40th with items like a Talking Flower from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros.

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250930.html">official press release</a>, Nintendo Singapore was established last week on 26th September 2025. It aims to accelerate the growth of the company's business in Southeast Asia and will be led by managing director Takahiro Miura. Here's the announcement and overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Co., Ltd. (HQ: Kyoto, Japan, President and Representative Director: Shuntaro Furukawa; hereinafter “Nintendo”) hereby announces that on September 26, 2025 it established Nintendo Singapore Pte.

<p>The same announcement also mentions how Nintendo is considering establishing a local entity in the Kingdom of Thailand to accelerate business in this location. Earlier this year, Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">set up a new subsidiary</a> located in Taiwan, including the launch of the Nintendo eShop in this location.</p>
<p>This follows the launch of the Switch 2 in June, with sales of the new system already off to a flying start.

<p>Once again, the focus is on "stability improvements" to make the new and old hybrid hardware super stable. Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h3>Ver. 20.5.0 (Released September 29, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nyjgml&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1972886876018123087">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has shared some insight about this latest update on social media. While the patch notes list the sole change as "stability", there is apparently "some code related to handling accounts and system time" that's been updated (<a href="https://switchbrew.org/wiki/20.5.0">via SwitchBrew</a>). As for Switch 2, there are no additional details about these patch notes right now, but according to the same source, there could still be some compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles.</p>
<p>If we find out anything else about this latest update (or if there are any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/more-switch-games-have-received-switch-2-compatibility-fixes">compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles</a>, similar to the previous update), we'll let you know. This follows an update at the start of this month, which also included stability improvements. Nintendo released multiple stability fixes in July and earlier in June as well.</p>
<p>To manually perform this latest system update, navigate to System Settings &gt; System Update &gt; and from there you should be able to download and update your system. Nintendo also updated its music app today, adding a new track from Princess Peach's Switch outing.</p>
