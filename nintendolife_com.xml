<p>According to some folks in Japan, however (thanks, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/">Nintendo Soup</a>), their consoles are actually overheating. Multiple users have taken to X to relay instances in which their games have crashed, the consoles' fans have gone into overdrive, or, in one case, their system simply became too hot to hold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xoqtwy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://x.com/x1010_q" tabindex="-1">@x1010_q</a> stated (via machine translation) "Switch 2 overheating. Too intense, I couldn’t even hold the console. Without a fan, you can’t play for long". Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/JPSjxSmUMy170" tabindex="-1">@JPSjxSmUMy170</a> simply said "Switch 2 is overheating; the fan noise is annoying".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear whether the Switch 2 consoles are definitely, irrefutably overheating in these cases, however. As demonstrated with <a href="https://x.com/p_typhoon" tabindex="-1">@p_typhoon</a>'s tweet below, they merely mention that "The fan's going nuts" after an instance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> crashing, but we can't say for sure that this is the root cause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First freeze on Switch 2.<br>
Talked to an old man in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and it froze.<br>
The screen's still moving (background grass swaying in the wind), but I can't control anything.<br>
The fan's going nuts, so maybe it's overheating.<br>
Auto-save saved my butt...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also important to keep in mind the environmental conditions in which the Switch 2 is being played. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68567/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-dock-becomes-hot-and-stops-outputting-to-tv-or-charging">Nintendo itself advises</a> that users should "not place the console near a heat source, or in a location where heat can easily build up", while also ensuring that "the air vent on the dock is not covered or obstructed".</p>
<p>So this is clearly a <em>potential</em> issue that Nintendo is very much aware of. We can certainly attest to the console getting rather warm after a certain amount of time but – touch wood – we've not yet had any instances of the Switch 2 overheating.</p>
