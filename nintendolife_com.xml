<p>Let's go, Tokyo!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a little something to make you smile. The Pokémon Company has today shared another look at its upcoming theme park, 'PokéPark Kanto', and announced that gates will open on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Tickets to this new section of Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park will open for Japanese residents on 21st November and will be distributed by a lottery. There's currently no information on how those of us who live in other countries can nab tickets, but the official English booking website currently hosts a "Coming Soon" message, so keep an eye out for updates in the coming months.</p>
<p>But what's this PokéPark all about? This permanent outdoor Pokémon experience — the first of its kind, surprisingly — is divided into two areas: the Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the forest area will be your chance to see Pokémon 'in the wild'. Okay, it's actually just a bunch of statues dotted throughout a woodland walk, but you can expect photo ops aplenty with the likes of Pikachu, Eevee and Nidoran.</p>
<p>Sedge Town is more of a commercial area, with a Pokémon Center and Poké Mart you can pop into for merch, rides like the 'Pika Pika Paradise' and 'Vee Vee Voyage', and the 'Sedge Gym' show area.</p>


<p>It all looks really rather sweet, if you ask us. If you happen to find yourself in Tokyo next February, you know this'll be worth popping into.</p>

<p>Pikmin pictures</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo surprised us all last month when it announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> would be getting a free content update at some point in November. Well, that "some point" finally has a date — it's today!</p>
<p>Yes, Pikmin 4 was officially updated to ver. 1.1.0 this morning, adding new gameplay options like difficulty modes, the 'Field Camera' item, Decor Pikmin and more. It might not be the grand 'Switch 2 Edition' that we were all secretly hoping for (you'll find no additional perks on the new hardware here), but it <em>is</em> an excuse to dive back into a new save file, and we could all do with that.</p>
<p>Besides these content additions, the update also includes new control options, bonus <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pikmin_bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> connectivity, and a handful of bug fixes. The patch has even rolled out to the game's free demo, so you can see some of these newbies in action without having to spend a penny.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/62986/~/how-to-update-pikmin-4">Nintendo Support website</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 4 ver. 1.1.0 (11th November 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Newly Added Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now choose from three different activity levels for creatures: Relaxed, Normal, and Fierce.
<ul>
<li>This can be changed at any time from Settings in Options (- Button).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now take pictures with the “Field Camera” item and decorate them with stamps and frames.
<ul>
<li>The Field Camera is added to your bag on the morning of day 2.</li>
<li>If resuming save data from before the software is updated, it will be added to your bag when you return to the Rescue Command Post and morning arrives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”Decor Pikmin” will now appear in the story.
<ul>
<li>To have Decor Pikmin join your squad, after rescuing the Rescue Corps Ranger Dingo, use the Field Camera to take pictures of a Decor Pikmin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By sharing the data of Decor Pikmin who have joined your squad in the full version of Pikmin 4 with the smart device application Pikmin Bloom, you can also get seedlings for those same Decor Pikmin in Pikmin Bloom.
<ul>
<li>You can send the Nintendo Account ID and discovered Decor Pikmin data when you finish exploration on the day the Decor Pikmin was discovered.</li>
<li>The Nintendo Account must be the same between the user playing Pikmin 4 and the one playing Pikmin Bloom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now use “Roll Over” in which you begin another playthrough, carrying over some of the save data on a file that has cleared the story.
<ul>
<li>With save data present that has cleared the story, select an empty Rescue Database on the file selection screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have ever reached the morning of day 2 in the story, you may skip that introduction when playing again from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>You begin from exploration day 2 in which you head for Sun-Speckled Terrace after creating an ID Badge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Newly Added Controls</strong></p>
<p>The following control settings have been added to Settings in the Options menu (- Button).</p>
<ul>
<li>You may switch between enabling and disabling Auto Target Lock for Cursor.</li>
<li>You may select either the cursor or the player avatar as the center point of the whistle.
<ul>
<li>This is set to “Player Avatar” when you begin with the activity level set to “Relaxed,” but this may be changed at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may now select either “Normal” or “Precise” for the speed of the arrow that appears when you hold down X to aim. Setting this to “Precise” will make it easier to adjust the direction of the Pikmin’s Charge and Oatchi’s Rush.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed other issues to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A patch with the same changes has also been distributed for the Pikmin 4 demo (Ver. 1.1.0). The demo version cannot link to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.</p>

<p>Gaten speaks out</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="445fe0cbe1414"><a title="Zelda / Dustin" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/445fe0cbe1414/zelda-dustin.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Just recently, <strong>Stranger Things</strong> star Gaten Matarazzo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-calls-on-stranger-things-star-to-promote-its-new-pokemon-adventure-for-switch-2">featured in a Nintendo commercial</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but it seems like his heart belongs to another game entirely.</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://x.com/ign/status/1988069787251925351">IGN</a>, Matarazzo states that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> is "just my comfort game", confirming that he is currently on his third playthrough of the 2023 title. The conversation soon turns to the Zonai devices, with Matarazzo claiming that, like the interviewer, he has no creativity when it comes to building machines.</p><div><figure data-videoid="5VNLcGb4n_E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VNLcGb4n_E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt5VNLcGb4n_E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5VNLcGb4n_E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VNLcGb4n_E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31cf32ylpohw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Of course, because you simply <em>have</em> to make some sort of connection to Stranger Things itself, Matarazzo also insinuates that the Depths within Tears of the Kingdom is similar to 'The Upside Down', which... yeah, okay, we can allow that.</p>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom is, of course, one of several games to receive the 'Nintendo Switch 2' treatment alongside Breath of the Wild. Both titles run at a much higher frame rate and resolution on Nintendo's new console, with a new 'Zelda Notes' feature for those who just cant stop looking at their phones.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1988111198080868497">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> notes the following about the 'Display' segment of the latest patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Version 21.0.0 adds a way to view the peak brightness value when adjusting HDR settings in TV mode. This change appears to have been mistranslated in the English patch notes, as it says an entirely different setting was changed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we hear about anything else significant about the latest system update, we'll be sure to let you know. This follows the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-5-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">Version 20.5.0</a> at the end of September, which focused on general system stability improvements.</p>

<p>Reggie has even shared an official comment about Pokémon's success over the years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Pokémon Company is without peer, responsible for creating a massive juggernaut of a franchise that has become a landmark title in gaming’s storied history. I saw firsthand the love and care that went into each Pokémon game I was part of, and how much each new game resonated deeply with the fans. Now, to be there for Pokémon, when it’s being recognized as this year’s winner of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award, it’s a full circle moment that I am ecstatic to be a part of!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in the same PR, Pokémon originally broke through in the "mid-to-late 90s", and most recently achieved "$12 billion global retail sales in 2024, including over 489 million game copies sold since 1996".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pokémon is considered one of the world’s highest-grossing media franchises. Its legend only grows stronger as new generations are drawn to new video games, animated series, movies, The Pokémon Trading Card game, mobile apps and more from The Pokémon Company."</p>
</blockquote>
