<p>Announced via a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">blog post</a>, you'll be able to carry over key progression across all relevant platforms, provided of course you actually own the game on multiple systems. This includes player level, unlocks, location mastery, campaign story progress, and more.</p>
<p>You'll need to ensure that you have an IOI Account and are signed into it on all relevant platforms to enable cross-progression. IO Interactive had included a <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full guide</a> on the steps and process necessary to achieve this.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_evSaRNgyaU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3otmzix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>For now, here's the full list of everything included in cross-progression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Experience<br>
- Player Level<br>
- Challenges<br>
- Location Mastery<br>
- Unlocks and Inventory<br>
- Achievements / Trophies<br>
- Freelancer Mode Progression<br>
- Campaign Story Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course, just to be crystal clear, here's what <strong>won't</strong> be included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Game license<br>
- DLC license<br>
- DLC-based unlocks<br>
- Leaderboard scores<br>
- Save Games (offline and online)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Our review</a> for the Switch 2 release of World of Assassination was largely positive, though we did take issue with the inconsistent performance on Nintendo's new console. Thankfully, IO Interactive has since introduced a new patch to lock the frame rate at 30fps, resulting in a more stable, enjoyable experience.</p>

<figure data-uuid="12a6d697a504d"><a title="Hasbro / Doug" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12a6d697a504d/hasbro-doug.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following his retirement as President and COO of Nintendo of America, Doug Bowser has now joined the board of directors for toy manufacturer Hasbro.</p>
<p>This news come <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">directly from Hasbro</a> itself, with the firm confirming the appointment of Bowser alongside Carla Vernón, CEO of The Honest Company, a digital-first consumer goods company founded by actress Jessica Alba.</p>
<p>Hasbro, of course, is much more than a mere toy manufacturer, and owns the trademarks and products of Kenner, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, and Wizards of the Coast. The latter company is responsible for the ludicrously popular <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> and <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>, while huge brands like <strong>Transformers</strong> and <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> also fall under Hasbro.</p>
<p>Here's what Rich Stoddart, Chair of Hasbro's Board of Directors, had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are delighted to have Doug and Carla join our seasoned and dynamic Board of Directors. Doug and Carla bring extensive leadership experience across consumer brands and franchise management. Their expertise and guidance will be invaluable as Hasbro continues to execute its long-term innovation and growth strategy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Doug Bowser's successor at Nintendo, Devon Pritchard, has kicked off 2026 as Nintendo of America's new President and COO. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/im-excited-to-meet-you-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-public-appearance-as-president-of-noa">She made her first public appearance</a> in the role at the 15th Annual New York Game Awards, delivering a pre-recorded message to praise the event and the nonprofit 'Playing With Purpose' writing programme.</p>
<p>Chances are we won't see much of Doug Bowser in the months and years ahead as he works behind the scenes at Hasbro, but hey, maybe he'll have a say in whether <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> comes to the Switch 2, huh?</p>
