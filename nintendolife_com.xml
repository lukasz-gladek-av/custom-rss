<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/nintendo-eshop-planned-maintenance-leads-to-further-imminent-direct-hype-1579413/">Gamereactor</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_GB/index.html">Nintendo's Japanese website</a> has flagged eShop maintenance later this week — between 7 - 8:30am UK time — during which Switch 2 and Switch network services may be affected.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what it says on the webpage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future maintenance schedule<br></strong>[Affected Products/Services]<br>

<p>This is fairly standard practice for the platform holder, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumours of a Nintendo Direct before the end of July</a> suggest there may be a link between this particular maintenance window and a yet-to-be-announced Direct broadcast.</p>
<p>The most recent maintenance occurred just this morning, coinciding with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-3-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">system updates</a> for Switch 1 and 2 and the addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to NSO - along with more blessed stability for the platforms. As we found out during the 3DS era, you can never have enough stability, right?</p>
<p>As ever, we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for announcements today and tomorrow. By most accounts, there's plenty of fodder out there for a Direct, whether it's a Partner Direct featuring the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-reportedly-announce-more-game-ports-for-other-platforms-soon">apparent Microsoft Switch 2 ports</a> tgat we've yet to get official word on, something involving the upcoming 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, or something more specialised and game-specific - a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> Direct anyone?...</p>
<p>Anyone?? Look, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-drag-x-drive-is-fantastic-but-is-it-destined-to-be-switch-2s-arms">we really liked what we played of it!</a></p>

<p>"We sincerely apologize for the long wait"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ahead of EVO 2025 later this week, Arc System Works has finally shared an update about the Switch version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a>, which was released at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Following a previous update, the development team has now confirmed the DLC characters Venom, Unika and Lucy will be made available for the Switch in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>. This version of the game is also expected to bring the Nintendo version "up to speed with the latest version".</p>
<p>This includes balance adjustments, ranked matches, and also plans to address some text issues. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>Guilty Gear Strive Nintendo Switch Edition Update (Fall 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the long wait regarding the update for Guilty Gear -Strive- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Venom and Unika, along with Lucy, are planned for an update in the Fall of 2025.<br>
Development for the Nintendo Switch Edition involves porting the character after completion, followed by sequential optimization and processing load reduction.</p>
<p>The Fall 2025 update is expected to bring it up to speed with the latest version, including not only playable character additions but also Digital Figures, balance adjustments, and Ranked Matches. Additionally, we are addressing issues where text is difficult to read in some language settings. Please look forward to the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows multiple DLC character updates for other platforms. The Switch version of the game includes 28 playable characters in the base package, including the first three seasons of the title.</p>
