<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/118f23e3c9254/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 is showing no signs of slowing down with these <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> updates, as it has just rolled out <em>another</em> one for both the Switch 2 and Switch 1 editions of the game.</p>
<p>Nintendo's new hybrid lands some exclusive tweaks this time around, with the ver. 1.4.0 patch adjusting some visual blurriness that would crop up in Docked mode, and the vibration intensity in the Pro Controller 2.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the Switch 1 edition has been left out, mind you, with both versions of the game landing new area challenges, materials, recipes and more.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_4_0/">Fantasy Life i website</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below. As we mentioned, some of the adjustments are for Switch 2 only (and some are unique to Steam), but we have highlighted these where appropriate in the following rundown:</p>

<figure><a title="Breakout Beyond - TATE Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aa9e31a4581e/breakout-beyond-tate-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Atari and developer Choice Provisions have provided a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/breakout_beyond">Breakout Beyond</a> on Switch. It's good news for those who weren't keen on the new landscape orientations – you can now play in TATE Mode!</p>
<p>With the new update applied, all you need to do is head into the options, navigate to 'Layout' and change the playfield to 'Veritcal'. Et voilà! You can now play the game vertically, just like the original arcade classic.</p>

<p>It's pretty funny to us that the update has been applied to all platforms. If you've got a monitor that can easily be turned to a vertical orientation, sure, but we can't imagine folks paying on a giant LG TV having much luck on the likes of the PS4. Still, options and all that.</p>
<p>However you choose to play, Breakout Beyond is a cracking new entry in the long-running series. We gave it an 8/10 in our review and said "Whether you’re an old-school fan or a newcomer, Breakout Beyond may be the best way to experience Atari's stone-cold classic".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rihwox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<figure><a title="Game-Key Card Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6c91250da4f4/game-key-card-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today published the transcript of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a>, in which company president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked to comment on the Switch 2's Game-Key Card releases. Unsurprisingly, he came to the defence of the format. Equally unsurprisingly, we're still not convinced.</p>
<p>As highlighted on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lsxagrh4tp2j">@oatmealdome</a>, the topic arose from one shareholder's announcement to the Nintendo directors that they have concerns about the Game-Key Card format. "I've seen opinions on the internet saying that Game-Key Cards are unappealing," the investor said, "I'm concerned that if third-party titles using Game-Key Cards don't sell well, it will discourage third parties from supporting the Switch 2".</p>
<p>It's a fair comment, particularly given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">discourse around third-party Switch 2 sales</a> in recent weeks, but Furukawa dodged the issue like a pro. "We introduced the Game-Key Card because game file sizes are larger on the Switch 2 compared to the Switch 1," the company president responded, "We have various ways to distribute games on the Switch 2, and we are working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform".</p>
<p>Let's quickly break that down, shall we? The first section feels like a no-brainer, explaining the very basics of the format, but for all the beefy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fictions</a>, it turns a blind eye to the smaller titles that definitely could fit on a cart. As for the second section, it all feels very focused on the publisher side of things, doesn't it? As if to say, 'Oh, you don't want a Game-Key Card <em>or</em> an expensive cartridge? Have you considered releasing <em>digitally</em>?'</p>
<p>It has been rumoured for a good few months now that Nintendo is <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">only</a></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">offering publishers a Game-Key Card or an expensive 64GB cart</a>. This has yet to be confirmed, and Furukawa was never going to disclose that kind of information in a meeting like this, but it might have been nice to get a little more reassurance about what "working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform" actually entails. Hey, we can dream!</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether Game-Key Card releases actually have all that much effect on sales, but for the time being, prepare to see them sticking around on Switch 2 for a while.</p>
