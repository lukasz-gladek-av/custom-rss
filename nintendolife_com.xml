<p>Coming to Switch consoles this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Wishfully Studios' sublime debut, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a>, brought some top-notch puzzle/platforming action to Switch back in April 2024. Indeed, we went so far as to give this beautiful-looking cinematic adventure a rather splendid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">8/10 back at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Now, its Swedish dev, alongside publisher Thunderful Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/atari-to-acquire-steamworld-dev-thunderful">now majority owned by Atari</a>), has dropped a full 10 minutes of unedited gameplay footage from the game's soon-to-be-released sequel, the cunningly titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf</a>. Oh yes.</p>
<p>You can check out the video above, and we've got to say, rather unsurprisingly, it's looking like something we'll want to be playing as soon as it drops, on both Switch consoles, <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>. Keeping its predecessor's stylish sci-fi tone, the trailer shows off a game that will surely look fantastic in handheld mode on either Switch.</p>

<p>The original Planet of Lana made amazingly good use of its sci-fi setting and its gorgeous art-stylings to hammer home an emotional, absorbing and otherworldly tale, which also has its fair share of very good puzzles and platforming to keep you busy.</p>
<p>You know the score if you've played cinematic games of this ilk before, your <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ico">Icos</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Insides</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/another_world">Another Worlds</a>. Lots of running in fabulously animated fashion, basically, whilst avoiding death and making peace with the fact you have little in the way of defence. Relaxing!</p>

<p>Here are the patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="45e7a612de2e9"><a title="Nintendo Today!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45e7a612de2e9/nintendo-today.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has updated its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app for Android and iOS, boosting its reach with additional releases in four countries (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-today-updated-to-version-2-3-0-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>As detailed in the (very brief) patch notes, the app is now live in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Today! - Version 2.3.0 Update</strong></p>
<p>Now available in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've yet to experience the delights of the Nintendo Today! app, it's essentially Nintendo's primary way of communicating key announcements and updates since its launch in 2025. You'll often find that new trailers or even Nintendo Direct announcements will be made on the app before they go live on social media or YouTube.</p>
<p>One such announcement was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, the single-player spin-off title for the <strong>Splatoon</strong> series on Switch 2. A debut trailer was released on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">10th June 2025</a>, but we've yet to hear anything more about this mysterious title. Here's hoping Nintendo will host a fresh Direct soon and reveal its secrets.</p>
