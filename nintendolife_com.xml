<p>Last May, an Xbox Wire post announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_dolphin">Ecco The Dolphin</a> would be making a comeback with a remaster of not only the first game, but also the sequel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_tides_of_time">Tides of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Platforms weren't mentioned at the time, but a new two-page spread for the remaster in Famitsu this week lists the Switch - seemingly confirming the remaster is on its way to Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Additional details have also been shared by the series creator Ed Annunziata in this feature. As highlighted by Nintendo Everything, the plan is to include 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit versions in a single package, and allow players to swap between visual styles in "real-time".</p>
<p>The final name of this project is still being decided, but the favourite at the moment appears to be "Ecco Complete". Of course, this is all subject to localisation changes.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, these remasters will also be joined by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/ecco-the-dolphin-is-making-a-comeback-with-remasters-and-new-game">"new, third game"</a> at some stage. More updates related to Ecco are expected to take place this April, according to an <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">official Ecco the Dolphin countdown website</a>.</p>
<p>As we've previously mentioned, the original Ecco the Dolphin game, which launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, is playable via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The indie success story <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is today celebrating its 10th anniversary. As part of this, the game's creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has announced a special video broadcast.</p>
<p>It will apparently run for "about 23 minutes", and fans can expect to see some "pre-release footage" as well as the reveal of the new 1.7 marriage candidates at the end. Barone actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valley-creator-teases-two-more-marriage-candidates-for-update-1-7">teased this upcoming reveal</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what you can expect to see and hear about during the anniversary broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ConcernedApe:</strong> "I made a video for tomorrow's 10-year Stardew Valley Anniversary, it will "premiere" tomorrow at 11am PST...I go over some old builds of the game w/ commentary, briefly go over the many updates, give a special message to the players, and reveal the 2 new marriage candidates in 1.7."</p>
</blockquote>

<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 11am PST / 12pm MST / 1pm CST / 2pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 7pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 8pm CET / 9pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 4am (Thu) JST / 3am (Thu) AWST / 6am (Thu) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>To date, this hugely popular farming and lifestyle sim has now sold millions of copies worldwide and it's been updated over the years with a lot of free content.</p>
<p>Most recently, the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-now-available">made available for the Switch 2</a>. This version hasn't been released in every region just yet, but Barone mentioned last week that the Switch 2 Edition (and free upgrade for existing players) would be coming to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valleys-new-update-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-live">European and Japanese eShop in "a few weeks"</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The physical distributor Limited Run Games is teaming up with Marvel and Konami to revive multiple retro games in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection"><strong>Marvel</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection">Maximum Collection</a></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>This superhero-sized collection, "coming soon" to Switch and other platforms, will feature six "classic titles" spanning across the Arcade, 8-bit and 16-bit consoles.</p>
<p>The collection covers multiple genres and promises to take fans on a "comprehensive tour" of Marvel's gaming legacy. It won't just feature one version of a particular title, either - it offers "every major console and arcade iteration" available.</p>
<p>Here are the titles included in this new collection, with rollback netcode also confirmed for X-Men: The Arcade Game.</p>
<p><strong>X-Men: The Arcade Game (Arcade)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definitive mutant beat-’em-up returns! Experience the legendary cabinet action with full online multiplayer support for up to six players. Choose your favorite X-Man and take on Magneto’s army with the ultimate team-up experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Captain America and The Avengers (Arcade, Sega® Genesis/Mega Drive, NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take control of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Vision as you experience the cinematic arcade original or the unique platforming spin of the NES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/Venom: Maximum Carnage (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the iconic comic crossover, gamers take to the streets of NYC battling hordes of nefarious bad guys, all to the sound of a rockin’ 16-bit soundtrack! Switch between the rich color palette of the Super Nintendo version, or dive in and enjoy the Genesis/Mega Drive version’s gritty vibe. Whatever you choose, carnage is guaranteed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The superlative symbiote sequel! Go solo or team up in two-player co-op to take on the Life Foundation and Carnage’s offspring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade’s Revenge (Super Nintendo™, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Boy™, Game Gear™)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Navigate Arcade’s deadly "Murderworld." This collection includes the handheld versions of the game, offering a fascinating look at Marvel's history of on-the-go gaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Silver Surfer (NES)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test your Super Hero skills against one of the most infamously challenging shooters to ever grace a console! Featuring one of the greatest soundtracks in 8-bit history, this is a shooter that’s tough to master and tougher to put down!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Limited Run notes how this collection will feature "all new music from the legendary game composer Chris Huelsbeck".</p>
<p>As usual with collections like this, you can also look forward to a host of features designed to scratch that retro "itch". This includes a digital archive (featuring box art, instruction manuals and more), a music player (including scores for every version of every game in the collection), rewind &amp; save states, cheat menus, and display options - allowing you to relive the CRT days.</p>


<p>When we find out more about this collection, we'll let you know.
