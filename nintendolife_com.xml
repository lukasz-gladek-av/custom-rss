<p>This bumps this Switch title up to Version 1.2.1 and follows on from a Switch 2 game update at the beginning of last month. Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Ver. 1.2.1 (Released July 29, 2025)</h2>

<p>This is just one of many first-party Switch titles Nintendo has updated for the Switch 2 over the past few months. More Switch titles have also been made compatible on the Switch 2 thanks to regular firmware updates.</p>

<p>Nintendo has been busy this week with all sorts of updates, and yesterday it released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> for Switch Online's Super Nintendo app.</p>
<p>More details about this latest update have now emerged, and apart from being able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-can-now-remap-super-nes-controls-with-nintendo-switch-online">remap the buttons in this specific library</a>, it seems the CRT filter on this app has also received an update.</p>
<p>The filter update is apparently designed to better capture what the original experience on the SNES was like on older television sets. There are already some before-and-after comparisons doing the rounds online.</p>
<p>Polygon has actually showcased this "improved CRT filter" and just how "transformative" it is in a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/617241/nintendo-classics-snes-crt-filter-retro-games-how-to-turn-on">series of screenshots</a>. You can also see more comparisons like this on social media and elsewhere online:</p>





<p>This follows on from Nintendo releasing a similar update for the Nintendo 64 app alongside the launch of the Switch 2 and the GameCube library.</p>
<p>Once again, the latest update for the SNES app is part of the Mario Paint game drop this week, which also includes mouse control and Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/37a6d0938a306/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following three updates in June, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s first (<em>and probably last</em>) update for July 2025 is now officially live.</p>
<p>This might just be the biggest one yet, as it includes a whole bunch of general updates as well as multiple bug fixes. One, in particular, mentions how the frequency of "lap-type courses" has been increased in some modes. Another note mentions how the computer opponents have been made "weaker in everything other than Battle" mode.</p>
<p>There's much more alongside these adjustments, so here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>

<figure><a title="Fall Guys" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d86780b897dca/fall-guys.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mediatonic, Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Games are already benefitting in all sorts of ways from the Switch 2's upgrades, and with this in mind, Mediatonic's free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a> has now been updated for the new hybrid platform.</p>
<p>In this update, the battle-royale style game has apparently received an "improvement" on Switch 2 in the form of "uncapped" frame rates, allowing it to run at "up to" 60FPS. Here are the official patch notes via the official developer post on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPROVEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>"We have uncapped FPS on Nintendo Switch 2, allowing the game to run on up to 60 FPS on that platform."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part of the 'Tropical Tides' update, so if you're still playing this one, you can update your game now to receive the update. If you haven't played it before, you'll need an Epic account to participate in the cross-platform multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>This title originally made its debut on the Switch eShop in 2022. At the time, we scored it seven out of ten, calling it "chaotic fun" despite the choppy frame rate on the original Switch.</p>
