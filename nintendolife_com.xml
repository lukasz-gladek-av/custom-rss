<p>In a nutshell, it's confirmed that the development team started to think about moving the game over to the Switch 2 in 2021. The general idea was that if the new hardware could handle more objects in the environment, then the very nature of destruction would become significantly more enjoyable.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8gxvipq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's what was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Motokura:</strong> We originally began developing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> on Nintendo Switch, but we ran into some challenges. I think it was around 2021 when we started to think about moving development to Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Watanabe:</strong> We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2. One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything. That went hand in hand with the game’s core concept of destruction. It convinced us that this game would be even more fun if we developed it for Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Tanaka:</strong> From a programmer’s perspective, voxel technology is well-suited for creating gameplay centered around destruction. However, it also uses a lot of system memory, and we faced the challenge of Switch not having enough to support everything we wanted to do.</p>
<p>I'll explain with some simple arithmetic. If you're asked to double the size of a 1 × 1 pixel image in both width and height, you end up with a 2 × 2 image, which means four times as many pixels. But when you do the same with voxels, you've got width and height, but also depth to contend with. So, doubling all three dimensions gives you 2 × 2 × 2, or eight times the data. It may sound simple to just “double something,” but the reality is that memory usage, voxel density, and all kinds of processes end up gobbling up eight times the resources. It was clear that the memory available on Switch would struggle to handle that load, and we felt that manifesting the huge volume of terrain that we did in this game might have been unachievable on that platform.</p>
<p>With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity. That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we'd previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 fps. Things we'd given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible. Designers could also place as many objects as they wanted. There were so many moments when we thought to ourselves, “Now we can really do this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, with that context in place, let's take a look at how the game differs between the two consoles:</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 vs. Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/469d762bb927c/switch-1-vs-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It doesn't look <em>bad</em>, right (though the overall quality of the image provided doesn't do it any favours)? But it's clear just how much Nintendo was able to implement into the game world with the Switch 2, in addition to some fancy crepuscular rays shining down from above.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is launching this week on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. It was recently reported that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">physical copies of the game have managed to sneak out into the wild</a>, so be wary of what you're looking at online if you don't want to be spoiled.</p>

<p>Guys, I've played so much <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2eHtBrTPLbsgQZCUSwXNsT" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>I've done all the Grands Prix (on three stars, obviously), and the Knockout Tours (not on three stars, life is short). I've had an ongoing competition with friends on Mario Bros. Circuit Time Trial, where you go to bed victorious and wake up to a blurry photo of someone beating you by 0.003 seconds.</p>
<p>I've done more than 200 P-Switches and taken (I’ve just checked) about 211 photos in Free Roam, so now pressing minus is part of my normal driving flow and I share photos most days on our WhatsApp gaming group. Yesterday Ibby said "Great shots bro."</p>
<p>I’m now at the point of obsession where you try to get the balance right to bounce on a Toad's head indefinitely like a trampoline. Tricky!</p>
<p>It helps that the game is pure movement exuberance, every trick a bouncing, squashing, sparking laugh in the language of kart. And that the new moves turn it into a sort-of a momentum platformer, scratching some of the itch of not having a bona fide single-player Nintendo adventure at launch (and by 'momentum platformer' I mean you desperately try to fling your kart near a cliff edge with coins, overshoot, then try to get the rewind just right to end up on top anyway).</p>

<p>But there's no way I would have mained this game so hard if <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1217wZndXWyLR-OI95u2jM" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> was also out at launch. And I'm grateful for that, and the other ways the Switch 2 launch period has reminded me a bit of old-school Nintendo fandom. <em>I know this feeling.</em></p>
<p>There's Mario Kart, and the way the Free Roam mode has that unstructured (<em>or unfinished</em> <em>har har</em>) sense of self-directed play that came naturally when younger; getting new games on birthdays and Christmas, spending weeks licking the plate clean for all its offerings, then looking for new ways to play a game upside down and backwards (now spinning the plate?). The other day I was literally mooching around Mario Kart World backwards with 'X' held - it takes your focus off the route to better admire the cool tyre size transitions!</p>
<p>Then there’s the strong, thrifty, thorough energy in replaying all the upgraded Switch 1 games, too. You get that 20/20 new glasses <em>wow</em>-ness of loading up <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Fs03xLYflane1PNpr3Ocx" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, say — simultaneously enjoying what you’re playing and how you remember it and loving the difference — and then using the Zelda Notes app (with grating GPS off) to finally polish off the main side quests. I was glad to have played the one with the mushroom-hunting gals, and it feels like a brief reprieve from the firehose of constant gaming newness, to dot some Is and cross some Ts and plunge again into the depths at 60fps and without a hitch.</p>
<figure><a title="TOTK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8dff79bf0bd5/totk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This was a nice side quest. Thanks, Zelda Notes. — <em>Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I suspect there's also an element of Launch Period Grace, an unseen line where 'the new stuff' starts - as unreal-yet-real as a border on a map. <em>I've got a new console and want to be playing it</em>. That's <em>new</em>-new stuff like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TwJ_KC5ot53RThQZv0b83" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> — a game I somehow keep going back to in small bursts despite it not recognising my TV as 4K, in which you can only pick up one piece of museum litter at a time — and new-old stuff like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X2YRVFDyslw8zFInBQ38k" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>.</p>
<p>I know some third-party stuff has apparently underperformed, but I’ve still felt that hunger-is-the-best-spice tug that means games like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw00lEITDPk5MbbN4xRGLj0_" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> get some love in a way that reminds me of first loading up my new Game Boy Advance at my dad’s house, with <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/f-zero_maximum_velocity&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nh4Qs1f4TWr40BcOAogr9" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/f-zero_maximum_velocity">F-Zero Maximum Velocity</a> (and a barely visible screen). Or all those 4-star, mid-80s-scoring classics-to-my-family, like <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/fighters_destiny&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3hO_HRTlgqx6WYeLBcC6e6" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/fighters_destiny">Fighters Destiny</a> or <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/snowboard_kids&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pUcNY_XmI6rL3ogAWQRhp" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/snowboard_kids">Snowboard Kids</a> or <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/lost_kingdoms&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OEktimpTjmP0uYu-dCilw" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/lost_kingdoms">Lost Kingdoms</a> on the GameCube.</p>
<p>What’s weird is I think I was most struck the other day, when scrolling across the Switch home screen (apparently with unacceptable blur?), choosing which of the select, launch-glowed games to play. It reminded me of flicking through my N64 carts in their repurposed ice cream tub on days off school. Crazier still, I’ve just checked and there’s only about 10 of them, played and loved deeply enough to fill an era. (Yoshi’s Story was £18.99 from Cash Converters according to the peeling label on the back.)</p>
<figure><a title="N64 carts" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0e8d65f3ec3cb/n64-carts.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve had a blast getting to know my Switch 2, gorging on Mario Kart and the rest - pips and all. And now I've enjoyed these few weeks of runway where everyone’s gotten in-sync with excitement for Bananza - <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1752654427536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WDa8FrGaWtuLTK1wxNhKB" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">an all-timer Direct</a>, some snippets of the songs, opening Chrome in lulls at work because Bing corrects it to ‘Bonanza’. So much of games is the context around them, and it's nice to have some uncrowded space so ripe for hype. Now it feels like <em>proper</em>, Big Nintendo Release Time.</p>
<p>Just a couple of days to go.</p>
