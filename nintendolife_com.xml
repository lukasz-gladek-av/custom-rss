<p>After a restart, delays and an incredibly long wait, it appears Retro Studios' anticipated release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has <em>finally</em> been rated by the ESRB.</p>
<p>As highlighted on the official Nintendo website in the US, it appears the game will be 'T' for "Teen". According to the description on the same page, it contains animated blood, violence, and in-game purchases.</p>

<p>You can read ESRB's basic summary of this particular age rating below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Teen - content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://shinesparkers.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-what-it-means/">Metroid fan site Shinesparkers</a>, this rating is consistent with the main <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> games <em>before</em> the fourth entry. This rating has not gone live on ESRB's official website yet, so if we hear any changes or updates to this classification, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This follows the game being rated in South Korea by the Game Rating and Administration Committee in July, so hopefully it means an official release date isn't too far away. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently targeting a <strong>2025</strong> release. The Switch 2 version will also include enhanced resolution and frame rate, as well as Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lineup of games for the remainder of this year is already looking quite busy, with the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pok√©mon</a> game scheduled for October and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> now locked in for November.</p>

<p>Is it tarnished?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has a pretty big booth at Gamescom this year, with a large chunk of areas dedicated to the glut of third-party ports coming to (or are already out on) the Switch 2.</p>
<p>One of those upcoming titles is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, which brings the highly-acclaimed open-world RPG from FromSoftware to Nintendo's new console. This rerelease includes the base game, the <strong>Shadow of the Erdtree</strong> DLC, new weapons, classes, and armour. So we knew we had to try it out on the newer console.</p>
<p>And, after spending time with the game in handheld mode, our man on the ground Felix has <em>some</em> concerns about performance. Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to capture any footage, including over-the-shoulder footage (Both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDiSIezfsrw&amp;ab_channel=GVG">GVG</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025">IGN corroborate this</a>), so you'll have to use your imagination.</p>
<p>Felix talks about experiencing multiple instances of frame drops and stuttering while out in the open world, particularly after leaving the tutorial area. Of course, the demo is likely based on an earlier build of the game, so that's worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>He also got to try out one of the new classes and explore part of the early-game map, Limgrave. So while we can't show you any footage, it's worth listening to what Felix has to say ‚Äî and the lovely Alex's curious questions.</p>
