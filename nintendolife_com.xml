            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Console Archives Cool Boarders (Switch 2) - Not Up There With 1080, But Still Pretty Rad]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Hamster Corporation is on something of a winning streak, with the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-arcade-archives-game-on-nintendo-switch-plus-our-top-picks">Arcade Archives</a> series continually dusting off and polishing hundreds of notable games from the annals of history. Well, those wizards are back with the fresh <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-starting-lineup-revealed-includes-more-than-10-titles">Console Archives</a> brand, and the now 30-year-old ‘radical’ PlayStation sports game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> is one of the first. Yes, 1996, three whole years before anything <strong>Tony Hawk</strong>-related would reach consoles.</p>
<p>Much like the difference between skateboarding and snowboarding, in Cool Boarders, your character feels heavy, and your movements must be slow and deliberate if you want to pull off tricks. All this while carving fresh powder to avoid hitting trees or plummeting to a mountainous death. 'B' lets you jump, which will build speed and help you initiate tricks when leaping off heights. Meanwhile, 'Y' works as the Drift button, letting you quickly change direction and better handle corners.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are aiming to either get the highest trick score or the best time on each of the courses. You’ll start out meagrely, shrugging yourself off a ledge and maybe pulling off a 180, but there’s a high skill ceiling waiting to be found. When you ready a jump, the amount of time you press and hold a directional button before you leap dictates how fast you spin. Combine this with a Grab by holding 'R', and with a bit of patience, you’ll be hurtling down courses while pulling off sick 900 Nosegrabs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the stubborn gameplay is accentuated with great and suitably audacious '90s music, and some silly but nostalgic sound effects and narration. But, compared to its favourably reviewed peer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080 Snowboarding</a>, Cool Boarders doesn't quite compete in either the pure fun of the gameplay or the amount of content.</p>
<p>Hamster has preserved the visuals beautifully, glitches and all. Here, the PS1 original's 240p pixels are polished and presented faithfully, especially compared to the smooth anti-aliasing sheen found in the 2024 PS5 version, but anyone hoping for any upscaling options is out of luck. You can play around with the aspect ratio, either to fill the screen or condense it to perfect-pixel parity, but there's not much in the way of borders or other presentation options. However, the emulation seems to run perfectly, with no noticeable drops in frame rate or frame pacing, and thankfully, the CRT filters are gorgeous.</p>
<p>One issue is that while there is Quick Save and Quick Load, I would have just preferred a rewind option, or something as wild as the ability to slow the game's speed. I mapped the Save/Load buttons to the controller, but it still got things muddled up. Rewind would feel better, especially in a game where one mistake can ruin a run.</p>
<p>Neither the visuals nor the gameplay has aged as gracefully as 1080, but Hamster has done good work in presenting the snowy vistas and demanding gameplay for the modern day. Cool Boarders is a blast to play for short sessions, especially if you loved it back in the '90s, and while a couple of extra options might have been nice, this is the best way to play this beloved early entry in the ‘extreme’ sports genre.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders]]></content:encoded>

<p>As shared on the movie's official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUtDqY9gExC/">socials</a>, the poster shows Nintendo's prized plumber in his iconic Galaxy 'spin' pose. A heap of enemies soar through the clouds behind him, with Spike, Piranha Plant, Koopa Paratroopers, Lakitu and even Sledge Bro making an appearance.</p>
<p>"Same hero, new adventure. Mario returns in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, only in theaters April 1," the accompanying caption reads — hey, it's always nice to have a reminder about that release date moving forward.</p>

<p>We last got an extended look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in last month's dedicated Direct presentation, where we were <em>officially</em> introduced to Yoshi. A handful of smaller 'teaser' trailers have since been released, showcasing a little more Yoshi and giving us another look at that Odyssey dinosaur.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="4b32181d91b66"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b32181d91b66/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>27th February marks the anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_green">Green</a> in Japan, but this year's event is an extra special one: the Pokémon series is turning 30 years old.</p>
<p>Yes, that little RPG about catching cute and not-so-cute monsters and doing battle with your pals has been going for three entire decades. In that time, it's evolved from mere gaming phenomenon that rejuvenated interest in Nintendo's Game Boy seven years after it launched to the world's biggest media property.</p>
<p>'If in doubt, stick a Pikachu in/on it' probably <em>isn't</em> a mantra at The Pokémon Company, but you'd be forgiven for thinking it is, given the proliferation of that particular 'mon across every facet of the franchise. The series' success, though, goes well beyond the near-universal appeal of the electric yellow mega mouse who became its mascot.</p>
<p>Anyone who's <em>ever</em> been a Pokémon fan has a story that sticks in their mind; a particular Pocket Monster you caught and named, a story moment that stuck with you, a tense, skin-of-your-teeth battle you triumphed in, or a more personal memory about where you were in your own life's story while playing Pokémon.</p>
<p>Or maybe something outside the games entirely! With the anime, TCG, and the wider world of Pikachu and co., it's become so much more than <em>just</em> the games.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2f551e2f5c031"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f551e2f5c031/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Now, Red/Green/Blue/Yellow recollections are more than welcome, but we want to hear from you <em>whenever</em> you jumped on the Pokéwagon, whether you were there with your DMG-01 Day One, hopped aboard with a dual-screen console, got into the series more recently on Switch, or anywhere in between.</p>
