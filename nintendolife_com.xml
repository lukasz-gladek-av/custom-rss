<p>Get ready for an even bigger launch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> is on its way to the Switch 2 early next year, and Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have today revealed the "major DLC" for the title will be arriving on the same day.</p>
<p><strong>Visions of Four Heroes</strong> will add new stories and weapons when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$34.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), and pre-orders are now live on select platforms. Once again, this is the same release date as the Switch 2 version. Here's some additional PR, and you can check out the overview trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visions of Four Heroes features brand-new stories centered around four heroes whose stories were not explored in <em>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS:</em> Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao and Lu Bu. These stories are explored as “What If” scenarios and will allow players to discover new sides to these legendary heroes. New companions are also featured in the major DLC including Zhuhe, a Guardian of Peace; Diaochan, a beautiful warrior and a familiar fan favorite; and a mysterious new officer who will be revealed as the story unfolds.</p>
<p>"Fans will also be able to enjoy new weapons – the “Bow” and “Rope Dart” – to further enhance the exhilarating action of 1 vs. 1,000 warfare by leveraging each weapon’s unique characteristics on the battlefield. Existing weapons will also receive an update, granting new arts, skill panels, as well as an increase in the trait level cap. Finally, a new “Training Ground” mode will be included, where players battle formidable foes while practicing their skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you pre-order the DLC, for a "limited time" you will also receive an exclusive outfit for the protagonist (the "Yellow Turban Attire"). Here's a little more information about this, and you can find out more about this upcoming release (in general), in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Designed to embody the heroic spirit of DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS, this costume lets players take to the battlefield clad in the symbolic garb of the Yellow Turban Rebellion."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Get a head start!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Alongside a new story trailer today, Square Enix has released an eShop demo for its upcoming Switch and Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
<p>This demo will allow you to experience the opening of the new game, including the first chapter of three different story arcs from the "Retribution story, as well as the first chapter of the "Restoration story" (or up to three hours of gameplay).</p>
<p>Save data will also carry across to the full release when it arrives next month on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's some extra information about what you can expect in the demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing you’ll do is design your protagonist, and play through the explosive introduction to the game. You’ll discover how a joyful town festival turns to tragedy, and how your hero embarks on a journey of restoration and revenge.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You’ll set off after three antagonists, known as the Masters. Each of them has their own ‘Master of’ arc, and in the demo, you can play through the first chapter of each of them in any order you please.</p>
<p>You can also play up to the end of the first chapter of the ‘Kindlers of the Flame’ story arc, which focuses on the restoration of Wishvale and the town-building features of the game. It’s a great way to lay some strong foundations before you build the town of your dreams in the full game!</p>
<p>You can play through all this content for up to three hours. After that, the demo ends.</p>

<p>Is that...?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, Square Enix is releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 next February.</p>
<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play broadcast</a> earlier on, the team behind this reimagined release shared a new "follow-up trailer", briefly highlighting the journey ahead for the party of heroes. Fans also got a glimpse of - <strong>spoiler alert</strong> - an older-looking Kiefer, who you'll be reunited with on your adventures.</p>
<p>Here's the official description about Kiefer's return:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the core elements from the original remain, #DragonQuest VII Reimagined offers streamlined progression, fuller character development, and new storylines...</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You'll run into an older looking Kiefer during your adventure to the Rucker region of the past. Your party will sneak into Rucker Castle at night to help him. Don't let the guards spot you! If they do, don't worry — Kiefer has honed his skills and will support you in battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll get to fight alongside Kiefer again elsewhere...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the release of this trailer, Square Enix has also <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1988389037942640860">gone into a bit more detail</a> about the additional content and new locations in the game. To unlock these areas, you'll need to collect "fragments of broken stone tablets, fit them together, and place them on a pedestal of the same color".</p>
<p>You'll do this at The Shrine of Mysteries, which is located on the island your party calls home. Each stone tablet will lead to a different location with its own problems to solve. As you help out locals, you'll transform the world, with new islands appearing out of nowhere.</p>
