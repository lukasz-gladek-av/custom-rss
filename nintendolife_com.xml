<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7f9feee95eb2/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since Nintendo introduced motion control with its Wii console, we've had to contend with bolt-on plastic accessories getting in the way of perfectly good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_kart_wii">Mario Kart</a> multiplayer sessions.</p>
<p>The iconic Wii Wheel, while a novelty, was widely regarded by seasoned players as the worst way to control the game – and while I fear I may be upsetting some people with this statement, the same was generally true of the original Switch Joy-Con wheel, which launched alongside the console and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> back in 2017.</p>
<p>As predictably as night follows day, Nintendo has released an updated set of wheels for Switch 2, and if you're expecting me to suddenly completely revise my opinion of these largely superfluous chunks of plastic, you might be sorely disappointed. Does that mean they're not worth a look? Well, the answer to that is somewhat more complex.</p>

<p>Before we dive into that, though, let's talk a little about what's new and different with this pair of wheels. As you can imagine, the design has changed in order to accommodate the larger Joy-Con 2, and I have to admit I do like the way these look. The coloured band which runs around each wheel offers welcome grip, and Nintendo has done a good job of making the wheel look as neat and tidy as possible – you won't spy any screws, for example.</p>
<p>I'm also pretty pleased with how the Joy-Con 2 clicks into place using magnets; once slotted into the wheel, the controller automatically tries to pair with your console thanks to this magnet connection – just like when you bolt it onto your Switch 2. On the back of the wheel are two good-sized buttons which correspond to the shoulder triggers on top of the controllers; the Joy-Con 2's other inputs are all open to the elements and can be accessed normally.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c028917824f6e/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The appeal of this accessory — and those which came before it — lies in the fact that you can 'turn' it like a real steering wheel, delivering a sense of immersion which is not entirely unwelcome during intense <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> sessions.</p>
<p>The obvious shortcoming is that, with the wheel 'floating' in mid-air and not attached to a steering column, it's a frustratingly imprecise control method. There's a tendency to 'twist' the wheel during turns, and it's hard to gauge what the limits of your turn actually are, making tight changes of direction more difficult than they are when using the analogue stick. With prolonged play, you can coach yourself into holding the wheel in the right way, but it's never as accurate as using a Joy-Con or Pro Controller.</p>
<p>All of which means the wheel won't find any favour with serious Mario Karters – but then, that's not the sector of the market this product is aimed at.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f5158b56ff6ba/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, these wheels are intended to be used by more casual (and perhaps younger) players who are concerned with having as good a time as possible and not setting the best possible lap times. Sure, playing with a mix of wheels and Joy-Cons is only going to result in the wheel-based players losing out, but if you're <em>all</em> using a wheel and therefore on a level playing field, things become a lot more enjoyable.</p>
<p>The best thing is that these accessories are <em>fairly</em> cheap; a pair costs £16.99 / $25, so you can indulge in a four-player session for relatively little cash.</p>
<p>It's business as usual, then; the Joy-Con 2 wheel isn't going to change your mind on motion controls, but it can be the source of much entertainment and hilarity regardless – if you approach it with the right frame of mind, of course.</p>

<p>Multiple ratings have already been spotted</p>

<figure><a title="SpongeBob SquarePants" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcf2cf994a6b2/spongebob-squarepants.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch was treated to multiple SpongeBob games during its prime, and it looks like a new game in the popular Nickelodeon series could now be on its way to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's been discovered the title '<strong>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide'</strong> was rated in <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1930695174461554999">South Korea and Germany recently</a>. Adding to this, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/bob-leponge-est-de-retour-un-nouveau-jeu-video-prevu-pour-cet-automne-60284">Dealabs and Billbil-Kun report</a> it's coming to multiple current-generation platforms including the Switch 2, and it's expected to surface this November.</p>
<p>This new game will apparently retail for $39.99 USD (<em>or the regional equivalent</em>) and a physical version is also believed to be on the way to the Switch 2. Right now, there's "no trace" of a Switch version.</p>
<p>This next title would follow SpongeBob games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">The Cosmic Shake</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_battle_for_bikini_bottom_-_rehydrated">Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated</a>. Notably, THQ Nordic is hosting a <a href="https://showcase.thqnordic.com/">digital showcase</a> at the beginning of next month, which follows a <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcXWK2jJZc">teaser of a new SpongeBob game last October</a>.</p>
<p>This latest SpongeBob development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumoured-plants-vs-zombies-remaster-potentially-releasing-on-switch-this-year">same source sharing an update</a> about the rumoured <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">Plants vs. Zombies</a> remaster.</p>
<p>Sega also recently revealed SpongeBob would be appearing in the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> game later this year. And earlier this week, Nickelodeon's new multiplayer game (featuring SpongeBob) locked in a release date for Switch.</p>

<figure><a title="Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e3a1d01f39248/bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Here we are once more at the end of July. DK arrived on Switch 2 over a week ago and it seems that most people are absolutely loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> - most, but not <em>all</em>, unfortunately!</p>
<p>Nearly 1 in 10 players responding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/poll-has-donkey-kong-bananza-made-you-feel-ill">in our poll</a> say they're getting sick when playing the game. The exact cause is up for debate, with the camera's 'following' behaviour and the game's smashable terrain being likely culprits upsetting a sizeable minority of DK fans. That doesn't seem to have hurt sales of the game, mind, even if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/japanese-charts-donkey-kong-bananza-sells-a-bunch-but-cant-beat-mario-kart">Kong can't quite compete</a> with launch game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<p>Let's see if Team NL can break away from DK, shall we?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It won't shock you to know that I'm also playing Donkey Kong Bananza, and having an absolute whale of a time (no, there's no Whale Bananza transformation. Sorry). But I'm a lot further behind than everyone else, so I'm hoping to make some big, destructive progress this weekend.</p>
<p><em>"But wait, Alana, what about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>?"</em> Well... I'm 60 hours in and still haven't finished. It's taken a back seat until DK is done, but I'm dipping in and out of it still. I did, however, pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> in the sale the other day, so my little Fantasy Life might have to wait a bit longer.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm only a few hours into Bananza, but I've been loving it. However, I'm in a pickle of my own making.</p>
<p>My nephew was visiting earlier in the week and instead of making a save file and letting him branch off, I let him carry on auto-saving on my file and there's maybe an hour's worth of progress that isn't technically mine. Firing up my save, I'm beside a minecart in an area I've never visited...and I've got an awful itch to just start from scratch!</p>
<p>That I'm even contemplating a restart speaks to the quality of the game. The kids are getting no end of pleasure from every single "Ohhh, BaNAHna!", so I <em>might</em> just begin again. Good game.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> out of the way, it's time to get back into the streets of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and continue my World Tour playthrough. I do want to jump back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> but at the same time I don’t want to commit to another time-consuming game because my musical career demands some Summer releases.</p>
<p>It’s kinda scary that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> plot resonates so much with current affairs, even more so because when it was first released in 1999, it all seemed so far in a distant future and unlikely, but hey, here we are. I'll continue progress on that along with some more <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_4">Tekken 4</a> before jumping into <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_5">Tekken 5</a>. I am also on the home stretch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, just in time to try out the new DLC campaign next.</p>
<p>Game of the week is — really to no one’s surprise — Donkey Kong Bananza. I have been neglecting it because I’m saving those bananas for my Summer vacations. Smashing stuff is fun!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>After playing nothing but DK, DK and more DK, I think I’m in need of a change of pace. I’ve taken a shine to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1 + 2 Replay</a> for something completely different, and I’m still enjoying dipping into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> every now and then for a little retro Zelda kick.</p>
<p>Oh shoot, I’ve just remembered that I also have my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> save file glaring at me. I should probably get back to that at some point too…</p>

<p>"We understand this is disappointing"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>-inspired 3D action-adventure game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/knightling">The Knightling</a> will be launching this August on multiple platforms, but the Switch version of the game has been axed.</p>
<p>In an update earlier today, developer Twirlbound announced the game had "gone gold" ahead of the August release window for PC, PlayStation and Xbox, but also revealed it would "no longer" be releasing on Nintendo's Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We also wanted to let everyone know that we are no longer releasing The Knightling for Nintendo Switch. This was a difficult decision for us and we understand this is disappointing for fans who have been anticipating the Switch release."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this launch will still go ahead for other platforms on <strong>28th August 2025</strong>, but it's game over for the Switch version. Unsurprisingly, fans are already calling for a Switch 2 release, so if we hear anything about this in the future, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Focused on expanding anime IP and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Digimon Story Time Stranger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd357dd40df66/digimon-story-time-stranger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some more Sony news, the PlayStation maker has this week acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>It's described as a "strategic business alliance agreement" with a focus on "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement". It reportedly sets Sony back "around $464 million" (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712901/sony-buys-a-stake-in-bandai-namco">via The Verge</a>).</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco and Sony have historically collaborated on various projects in the fields such as games, anime and music, and they plan to extend this collaboration to a broader range of areas. The two companies intend to implement initiatives including the expansion of works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising. They also plan to engage in detailed discussions regarding the joint development and promotion of IP such as anime and manga, in addition to planning and technical collaboration on experiential entertainment. Furthermore, the two companies plan to explore opportunities to support creators by jointly developing and operating entertainment-related technologies and services, and to engage in joint investments and business alliances in fan engagement areas."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony has previously invested in Kadakowa (the parent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> developer FromSoftware) in a new "alliance" last year.</p>
<p>As our pals at Pure Xbox mention, this latest partnership makes "transmedia opportunities" tied to areas like anime and manga "the priority". Sony also owns platforms like the anime streaming service <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>, which is available as an app on multiple platforms including Switch.</p>
