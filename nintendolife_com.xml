Welcome, one and all, to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last time, we checked out Red Alarm for the Virtual Boy, which of course will be joining the launch lineup for Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics on NSO later this month. It was a surprisingly close contest, with North America just about claiming victory with 54% of the vote.</p>
<p>So, we skip ahead to today, where we'll be looking at <strong>Super Bomberman 2</strong> for the SNES. This game is now, of course, fully playable on the Switch and Switch 2 as part of the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, so we thought it wise to go back and see how the box art stacks up in each region.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pngsmu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>US and EU designs are largely the same for this one (EU has a gold border, and that's about it), so we're going for a good ol' duel against Japan. Let battle commence!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:197105 @ 1770556608 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="067cc41eca3f3"><a title="Super Bomberman 2 - NA / EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/067cc41eca3f3/super-bomberman-2-na-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2403-super-bomberman-2">Konami / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so the Western design seems pretty standard at first glance, but it's a lovely composition nevertheless. We've got Bomberman in the extreme foreground with a load of enemies filling up the remainder of the space. There's some lovely use of colour, and you certainly can't say it isn't eye-catching.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d147762658b81"><a title="Super Bomberman 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d147762658b81/super-bomberman-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2403-super-bomberman-2">Konami / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's design is a bit more, shall we say, symmetrical. Which is good! It seems a bit busier in its composition, and again, the use of colour is simply superb.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting!

<p>Expect the following adjustments</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="87015558535f3"><a title="Adventures of Elliot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/87015558535f3/adventures-of-elliot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>During Nintendo's Partner Showcase this week, Square Enix announced its new HD-2D RPG title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/square-enixs-gorgeous-hd-2d-zelda-like-the-adventures-of-elliot-launches-this-june">coming to Switch 2 this June</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, it has announced it will be making some changes to the game based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-wants-feedback-about-its-new-hd-2d-game-coming-to-switch-2">previous demo feedback</a> from players. Here are the adjustments on the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Based on the feedback from the post-play survey of the debut demo released on Nintendo Switch 2, we will be making the following adjustments."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Increase in Elliot's Movement Speed</em></li>
<li><em>New Difficulty Levels</em></li>
<li><em>Expanded Convenience Features for Magicite</em></li>
<li><em>Adjustment to Weapon Shortcut Menu Behaviour</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't already played the 'Debut Demo', you can access it from the Switch 2 eShop. Here's some additional information about what it offers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ‘Debut Demo’ is designed to give you a sense of the exploration and action you’ll experience in the game, so expect plenty of crunchy combat, spooky caves and all kinds of secrets hidden around.</p>
<p>See a crackable wall? Blow it to smithereens with a bomb and you might discover a Secret Treasure Route- a small dungeon you can explore for valuable rewards.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find a Shrine of Life - these optional challenges put your combat and traversal skills to the test. Perhaps you’ll find valuable loot like magicite or money. Always remember - this is a game that rewards the curious.</p>
<p>Or, you could follow the quest markers and delve into a deadly swamp, and the Unexplored Ruins beneath. This multi-level dungeon is full of dangers - so be sure to use everything you’ve learned to find your way through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We went hands on with The Adventures of Elliot last August. You can can read and see what we had to say about it in our previous coverage:</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> this week, Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tales-of-arise-beyond-the-dawn-edition">Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn Edition</a> for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The game's official Japanese website has now shared some details about the performance and resolution. Players can expect a resolution of 1080p across both docked and handheld modes, with cutscenes running at 60fps and the field exploration, battles and other aspects of gameplay targeting 30fps.</p>
<p>It's noted how the frame rates may temporarily change depending on the playing situation and environment. According to the same page, the game requires around 54GB of space. We'll provide an update about this when local listings pop up.</p>

<p>Here's what the critics think</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo is launching its Virtual Boy- Nintendo Classics digital library for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service later this month, and the previews are now in.</p>
<p>First up are our own impressions from Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s no secret that the Virtual Boy failed spectacularly when it originally launched back in 1995. As such, you might be under the impression that its games just aren’t very good. Well, not so! Virtual Boy Wario Land is an incredible 2D platformer that makes spectacular use of perspective, while Red Alarm is a solid wireframe shoot-em-up with clear Star Fox inspirations.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"I wasn’t able to try Zero Racers or D-Hopper, since neither of them will be available at launch. But the sheer fact that both will be fully playable for the first time <em>ever</em> is reason enough to celebrate. What a time to be alive."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196665 @ 1770556610 -->
<p>So, what did other critics have to say about it? Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/preview-virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-a-strange-reality/">Vooks</a>: "The Cardboard VB requires you to hold the unit to your face, offering the more comfortable option of playing the games... The plastic VB recreation is more impressive. It’s as close as you’re going to get to play a VB unit without forking out the even bigger bucks for a real VB. Playing this way means you can have a more comfortable control set up. This is the only comfortable part of the VB though. It was difficult to get to a good or realistic height on the unit where I wasn’t hunched over and having to push my face against the VB. It will be good to get some longer time with the VB once it is released, even just to have a quick dip into some Nintendo history."</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a>: "The most vital aspect of all of this: after just a few minutes, my eyes and neck began to hurt and I had to back away. I got the same feeling of being disconnected from the physical world around me and needing to re-integrate with it as soon as I was done that I normally get from using modern VR headsets. We've come so far in terms of VR tech, but for me that sense of dislocation hasn't changed at all."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/preview-new-nintendo-virtual-boy/">DualShockers</a>: "I... walked away a believer in these games, even with the understanding that 30 years ago, they didn't move the needle enough for mass adoption. Maybe I'm just a sucker for retro, arcade-y titles as I continue to age into my thirties, but I also know I won't at all be alone in this sentiment. If retro titles are your jam, there's a lot to have a good time with here."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/articles/previews/virtual-boy-switch-online/">CGMagazine</a>: "<em>Wario Land...</em> showed the most promise of the launch titles—just as it was arguably the most in-depth game on the Virtual Boy in its own time. Hopping between the 3D planes became more than a gimmick, as swinging hazards immediately illustrate; this is a legitimate platformer and a decent successor to the Game Boy games, and you’ll need to learn to pay attention to multiple planes to survive and thrive."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">IGN</a>: "I only played for about 20 minutes, but I thankfully didn’t get a headache like the original hardware’s reputation would suggest. I’m honestly not sure how long I’ll play in one sitting when my own Virtual Boy preorder shows up in a couple weeks, because even though Wario Land was fun, it’s still kind of a pain to play. The edges of the screen were tough to see when looking in the unit, and it’s not the most comfortable feeling to crane your neck to look inside. At least it’s that authentic neck pain I’ve always wanted, though."</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/03/i-played-the-virtual-boy-games-on-switch-2-and-it-was-actually-kind-of-cool">Game Informer</a>: "People speak so poorly of the 1995 model that I fully expected to immediately reject the Switch 2 version, but I came away mildly impressed. When the baseline expectation is "headache, neck pain, and nausea" but the actual experience is "huh, pretty neat," I think it's fair to say this exceeded my expectations. It's far from a perfect device, but it very well may be the best way to revisit Nintendo's worst console."</p>
