<p>The illustration packs in characters from Layton, Inazuma Eleven, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/decapolice">DECAPOLICE</a>, Fantasy Life and even <strong>Holy Horror Mansion</strong> — about which we still know very little. It doesn't include any <strong>Yo-Kai Watch</strong>, but come on, we're not miracle workers...</p>
<p>"We have lots of new developments planned for the future," Hino wrote in the artwork's caption (translated via Google), "so we hope you will continue to support us".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mjszpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>After the stellar launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> earlier this year, the next Level-5 project we have to look forward to is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, which <em>should</em> finally arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on 14th November. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> and DECAPOLICE have been delayed to 2026, so we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on either of them.</p>
<p>After that, we've got the remade <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/inazuma_eleven_re">Inazuma Eleven RE</a> and whatever Holy Horror Mansion turns out to be. In short, it looks like Level-5 is sticking around for the foreseeable future. Let's just hope that the quality can stick around with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> is just about to launch on the Switch 2, and to celebrate, Sega has announced another new DLC expansion scheduled to launch this winter.</p>
<p>Dubbed 'Zooseum', it's essentially, well... a zoo. It's a brand new location that will no doubt introduce a smorgasbord of interesting creatures to care for as you look to expand your blossoming museum even further.</p>
<p>Details are rather scarce at the moment, so we don't have a firm release date for the expansion just yet, but it's nice to know that it's coming, at least.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this wild new DLC, a brand new museum location dedicated entirely to the wonders of wildlife will open its doors. Wildlife Experts will be called upon to rescue, heal, raise, and re-wild an incredible variety of creatures, while expanding your museum in exciting and unexpected ways."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our recent review for Two Point Museum, we said that it's probably the best entry in the series yet, but lamented the lack of mouse controls and some apparent performance issues on the Switch 2. Be sure to read our full verdict if you're currently on the fence.</p>
