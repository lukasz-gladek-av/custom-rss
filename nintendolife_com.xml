<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/poppy_playtime_chapter_1">Poppy Playtime</a> is one of those strange video game phenomenon, in this writer's experience at least, that seems to be a pretty big hit with younger players, even though it's a proper creepy-ass horror game. There are toys of this franchise everywhere, and we've even got a movie on the way. And, it has the vibe of something that's fallen out of Roblox, too.</p>
<p>It'll come as some very good news to fans of Mob Entertainment's series, then, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/poppy_playtime_chapter_4">Poppy Playtime Chapter 4</a> (the 4th chapter in the Poppy Playtime saga lest you're confused) drops onto consoles - including that there Nintendo Switch - on <strong>June 25th</strong>.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Poppy Playtime, you see, is set in an abandoned toy factory that's full of very nasty toys who are set on making life unsettling for you, a factory worker who needs to get the heck out of there. Cue lots of creepy doll stuff that probably isn't really all that suitable for young kids, actually.</p>

<p>This 4th entry, entitled "Safe Haven" continues the nightmare, with a fairly large cast of characters to meet as you work through its puzzles and utilise its gadgets.</p>
<p>Chapters 1-3 of Poppy Playtime have been well received by players over time, and although this 4th chapter has already been released to somewhat disappointing (in comparison) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008670/Poppy_Playtime__Chapter_4/">reviews on PC</a>, there's still been enough love that we're sure fans will be very interested in picking it up.</p>
<p>Now, that June 25th release date gives us just enough time to get some clean underwear in, as we're actually fairly terrified of some of the dead-eyed, ghoulish toys in the game's fresh new console launch trailer...</p>
