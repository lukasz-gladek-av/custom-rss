He went on to lead his own group at <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Production_Group_No._9">Nintendo EPD</a> and played a role in the creation of the 3DS as the producer.</p>
<p>In more recent years, he acted as a producer on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, and helped run <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Smart_Device_Production_Group">Nintendo's mobile division</a>, working on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_heroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>.
