<figure data-uuid="b35063f91838e"><a title="Hades 2  Switch 2 Physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b35063f91838e/hades-2-switch-2-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After what felt like an age of early access waiting, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> finally arrived as a console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2 back in September. Two months on, and that Switch 2 release has scored a physical edition — what's more, it's a beauty.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to get our hands on the new box today, and feast our eyes on all of the goodies within (a download code to a digital soundtrack, a 'Character Compendium' booklet, and the full game complete on cart). The nicest surprise of all, however, was the reversible cover art, giving us an option between the standard red banner of a Switch 2 physical, and something more... artsy.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JmOlmniuSog" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJmOlmniuSog" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed624b7cprlzyn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Flipping the cover insert over, you're treated to alternate artwork featuring the game's protagonist, Melinoë, on the front of the box, while a dark and brooding image of Hecate adorns the back.</p>
<p>It's a neat touch, and one that we're sure you'd like to check out for yourselves, so we've assembled the following gallery detailing everything you get in the Hades II Switch 2 physical edition, and a closer look at the all-important art. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>

<p><em>The physical Switch 2 edition of Hades II is now available to purchase at most major retailers for £39.99 / $49.99</em>.</p>

<p>What a combo</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a long-time reader, then you know we love a bit of Jupiter's Picross series. And we're in for a treat on 27th November 2025, as we're getting two brand new Picross games on Switch.</p>
<p>Jupiter has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/picross_s_capcom_classics_edition">Picross S Capcom Classics Edition</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/picross_s_snk_classics_neogeo_edition">Picross S SNK Classics &amp; NEOGEO Edition</a>, with both games featuring tons of pixel art puzzles for you to solve from various Capcom and SNK properties. Both titles will cost <strong>$17.99 / €17.99 / £16.19</strong> each.</p>
<p>For Capcom, you've got some familiar favourites such as <strong>Street Fighter</strong>, <strong>Mega Man</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ghosts_n_goblins">Ghouls 'n Goblins</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire">Breath of Fire</a>, <strong>Final Fight</strong>, and other classic Capcom franchises.</p>
<p>SNK's own Picross entry pulls from <strong>Metal Slug</strong>, <strong>Fatal Fury</strong>, <strong>King of Fighters</strong>, and many other titles from its illustrious fighting game history and NEOGEO catalogue.</p>

<p>Both games will include Picross, Mega Picross, Color Picross, Clip Picross, and Extra modes, as well as art galleries and grid guidelines. On Switch 2, both will be compatible with Mouse Mode too!</p>
<p>We've seen Picross team up with Mario, Zelda, Pokémon, Doraemon, Sanrio, Story of Seasons, and many more IPs. We'd love to see even more like Capcom and SNK, too. Spoil us!</p>
