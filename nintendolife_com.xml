<p>Update: It's officially over</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata Louvre" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9d7866e0533a4/satoru-iwata-louvre.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-09-02T18:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 2nd Sep 2025, 7:30pm</time>]:</strong> It's official - the Louvre has finally laid its Nintendo 3DS audio guides to rest.</p>
<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/09/02/louvre-says-game-over-to-its-nintendo-3ds-visitor-guide_6744946_13.html">French newspaper Le Monde</a>, the world-renowned museum ended the service on 1st September 2025. It originally announced it would be retiring the novel museum guides sometime in September.</p>
<p>It's an extremely novel concept, so it's a little sad to see it concluding, but it makes sense at this point — maybe Nintendo could get a Switch or Switch 2 audio guide running for the museum, hmm?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:36010,35977 @ 1756841407 --><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> The Louvre Museum in Paris, France is retiring the Nintendo 3DS audio guides for the museum later this year.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/louvre-museum-removing-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides/">Nintendo Everything</a>, the <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">official website for the world-famous museum</a> confirms that the 3DS console audio guides are going "out of operation" sometime in September this year in place of a new system which hasn't been confirmed. A Nintendo Switch 2 app, perhaps...? Oh, come on, you thought it too.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the Louvre and Nintendo first dropped in 2012 — where you could "rent" a 3DS at the Louvre to use as an audio guide. Nintendo even held <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">a dedicated Direct</a> on the collab in 2013 to announce a purchasable version of the software, so people could experience the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. We'll pop that Direct below, because seeing Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto together gave us the warm fuzzies.</p>

<p>The software itself contained high-quality photos and 3D models of much of the museum's iconic artwork. Over 600 images, 30 hours of audio commentary, and more than 400 3D reconstructions of museum rooms are part of the software.</p>
<p>It was, and still is, an extremely unique collaboration, and we're a little bit sad to see it go. But it's been around for 13 years, so it makes sense. So, if you want to experience the Louvre in a truly unique way, then you've got until September 2025 to rent one of those special 3DS's.</p>

<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">Inverse</a>, game director Kazutoyo Maehiro stated that if the upcoming launch does well, then this could potentially open the door to remasters of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> along with brand-new sequels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If The Ivalice Chronicles can do well, that’s good for the fans, they can enjoy it. But, at the same time, it shows the business viability of the strategy RPG genre. So that could potentially open the door for doing something with <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> or <em>A2,</em> or maybe even sequels and new titles as well.</p>
<p>"I think I speak for everyone who’s worked on the original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>, and is working on <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> as well — we’d really like to see that happen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tactics Advance (2003) and Tactics A2 (2007) launched for the GBA and DS respectively to strong critical reception, though it's fair to say that neither were quite able to match the cultural impact of the original PS1 game.</p>
<p>That said, we're certain fans would love to see both titles remastered for modern systems, and y'know what, we definitely would too. For now, we'll have to make do with The Ivalice Chronicles. If you're excited to play this one, then be sure to vote with your wallets if you want to see more from Square Enix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158400/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Regarding modern augmentations, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> — released not even a month apart — have a lot of overlap. Yet, after 45 minutes of play, I was convinced that Art of Vengeance is one of the finest 2D Ninja action games ever made. Perhaps <em>the finest;</em> and such praise doesn’t come lightly.</p>
<p>After Ragebound’s dazzle, I was unsure if Shinobi could top it; yet it has. Visually beautiful, broadly artistic, and almost calligraphic in nature, the styling is well-married to its Japanese thematic. Natural elements of wood, cloth, and stone fuse with heavy machinery, concrete and military steel, the rural areas reflecting the painted landscapes of Hokusai and Taikan.</p>
<p>Lizardcube’s artists use a softening filter for a brush-like, watercolour flavour, and the grading is exceptional, bringing a picture book of panoramas to life without ever drowning out the foreground sprites. The hazy glow of orange-lantern-lit cities, thundering cornfields, and dense, raining cityscapes are majestic to behold, the camera often drawing out to allow a particular diorama to marinate. Where <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>’s multimedia clash was jarring in places, Art of Vengeance nails its aesthetic with pure, curved grace. That said, on Switch 2, the game's resolution isn’t properly optimised, resulting in jaggy upscaling. Something to consider if that’s your primary console.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158398/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The score is provided by the eminent Tee Lopes (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>), and a smattering of additions by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro. It’s a fitting, occasionally haunting arrangement of traditional Japanese instruments, layered with rhythms to complement the pace of the action. As locales get more industrial, the tempo becomes increasingly dance-oriented.</p>
<p>Joe Musashi, the returning hero, cuts a fine form. Voiceless, and amusingly grunting his way through cutscene exchanges, he moves with fox-like agility and strikes with a rubber band snap. The animation flows with impeccable detail, from that slight spring of the heels to the graceful arc of a backwards evasion.</p>
<p>Joe's a blast to control; sprinting by default, and double-jumping and air-dashing freely. His invulnerable roll is cat-like, passing through dangers to position him for the kill. He can fire off Kunai for ranged attacks, drop kick onto the heads of enemies, and wields light and hard sword strikes that combo with the greatest of ease. Ninja action has literally never looked — or felt — this good.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158401/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet, what really separates Art of Vengeance from the aforementioned Ragebound — despite sharing so many of the same ideas — is its combat implementation. Shinobi doesn’t just give you a nice set of attacks and dodges: it gets <em>deep.</em> The technical opportunities here are so unflappably cool, so tightly engineered, and so seamlessly applied that each new mix-up routine leaves you with a foolish grin.</p>
<p>Unlike past Shinobi games, enemies now have life bars, tying into its new combat approach. Not dissimilar to a fighting game in its core mechanics, Joe is constantly granted new attacks and attack alternatives to try in the field. What it’s careful not to do, however, is blunt ambitions or alienate players with overbearing complexity. You don’t have to employ every trick to get through the game, as basic light and hard attack tandems, the odd Kunai, and whatever super attacks you have at your disposal will serve you well enough. You’re so tooled up by four stages in that the swordplay writes itself most of the time, leaving you to focus on your dodging, the game’s most essential move.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158403/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, if you want to get surgical, it’s ninja heaven. The impressive animation doesn’t interfere, as most of everything is cancellable into the next attack. To get an idea of the game’s motion, you can dash forward, tap 'R' to hop over a box without losing pace, before rolling through an incoming Shuriken. From there you light attack twice, tap 'R' to leap through the enemy, and slap the button again to whirlwind into them, layering the combo meter. Direct Joe to land back centrally, employ two heavy swipes and then leap for a one-two juggle, before shooting three Kunai through the opponent while they're still airborne. By this point the Execution Gauge is full, and slamming both shoulder buttons will send Joe ripping through them anywhere on the screen, releasing a bounty of health icons and gold.</p>
<p>If that sounds sublime, it’s because it darn well is. The devs have also implemented a hard-hitting use of slowdown, providing feedback when a critical hit has landed, or when you’ve taken a blow. And the full-screen super attacks, rumbling in with a falling bass line, are a sight to behold. The game also allows you to return to your training dojo from the World Map screen at any time, where you can hone new techniques and acquired skills.</p>
<p>There are some absolutes, however, that can't be ignored. For example, the charge fist, acquired early on, is required to punch through shielded enemies and inaccessible green barricades. The bosses, too, an impressive assortment of demons, machines, and guardians, are pattern-based and won’t submit to spamming. These encounters are thrilling once you get them down, compelling you to exploit your dashes, dodges, and supers in experimental ways. Art of Vengeance can be challenging, and although not quite on the level of some of Ragebound’s encounters, you are expected to be nimble, especially when navigating moving platforms or threading yourself through deadly obstacles.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158404/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those concerned that the game was <em>another</em> Metroidvania can breathe easy, as it’s a largely linear affair. From the World Map screen you can see percentages of completion, and backtracking is optional. There are five hidden orbs on each stage, and three areas where you can enter “Elite Squad” skirmishes: single-screen crowd battles to test the reflexes. Hidden orbs open up new skill options in the shops that, once purchased, can be applied through your gear menu. Here, you can customise Joe with your preferred attacks, upgrade Kunai to perform different functions, and even refashion the way the combo meter rewards you. It will be interesting to see how skilled players go down different routes with this.</p>
<p>Every checkpoint refills your life and doubles as a new teleportation spot. This means you can return to a stage — and, within that stage, a specific point — at any time. The most Metroid thing about it is that there are certain barricades that can’t be broken until you have a particular skill - but returning to them is neither obfuscated nor tedious, and in many cases either reap a quick reward or help you get closer to 100%. The primary impetus to do this is if you want to upgrade Joe faster, extending his health and super stocks. It's worth noting that even if you play it in a straight line, it's a lengthy campaign that will require around 10 hours to finish.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158396/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Stage layouts are broad but focused, with width for exploration. They run horizontally and vertically, are full of switches to trigger, and are inventively formed, with things to hang on, walls to run up, and air-dash extending portals to keep you in-flight. As per-Shinobi games of the past, Joe moves through the mountains and into more industrial territory, from factory smelting works to neon-draped cities full of fan-service Sega signage.</p>
<p>The action offers variety, too, whether racing on the back of a Yamato, Joe’s faithful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/shadow_dancer_the_secret_of_shinobi">Shadow Dancer</a> canine, or outrunning encroaching walls of flame. There are a few places where you're unsure if going down leads to a death or a new area, and it can occasionally be unclear where to go next - but this is what the map is for, ultimately. Perhaps there could have been more arcade-like variety in places, like the mountain factory’s awesome saw blade chicane, but the maps are well-engineered to exercise Joe’s skillset. Series fans will also note many a callback to the series' Mega Drive entries, with a fair lump sum plucked from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/shinobi_iii_return_of_the_ninja_master">Shinobi III</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158402/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of scoring, if it performed well, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a straight nine. It’s glorious. And that makes its frame rate issues all the more painful. Where Ragebound’s frame rate on Switch was its primary negative, Shinobi is buttery smooth for the most part. But, in certain spots where the camera scales out against busier backgrounds, it seriously suffers.</p>
<p>Initially, these instances are so brief they can be mostly overlooked, but in the Mountain Factory it suddenly becomes prolonged and increasingly severe, causing a jarring, peculiar sprite judder the like I’ve never seen before. We contacted Sega PR to see if this will be addressed in a promised patch, but we've had no response.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In reinventing the retro wheel, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance leads the way: a demonstration of how modern tools, accompanied by thought and talent, can be expanded upon to not just reboot franchises, but actually rebuild them in new and incredible ways. It’s one thing to revisit an arcade action game with new graphics, moves, and weapons, cherry picking familiar set-pieces and nostalgic visuals; it’s another entirely to create a new experience, utilising craftsmanship and a belief that the hardware can offer more.</p>
<p>Art of Vengeance, its cadence and flow, its violence and exhilaration — and the fact it makes you feel like an absolute badass from one slain enemy to the next — is a trendsetter. Fix that frame rate, and it’s pure ninja gold.</p></section>

<p>We were pleasantly surprised to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> make an appearance make an appearance in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Partner Direct</a>, and as we close in on its <strong>26th September</strong> release date, Bandai Namco has some fresh gameplay footage for us so we can see how it's shaping up.</p>
<p>The new gameplay trailer (above) gives us our closest look yet at the upcoming remake, with Pac-Man himself walking us through all the new additions. This includes a breakdown of his new moveset, the assist Fairy Mode and challenge Time Trial Mode, and the Pac-Village minigames.</p>
<p>The newbies are all well and good, but we're enjoying simply seeing more gameplay from the damn thing. Bandai Namco released a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pac-man-world-2-re-pac-is-a-big-glow-up-on-switch-and-switch-2">side-by-side comparison</a> of the 2002 original and the remake shortly after the game was announced, and it seems to be an almighty upgrade as far as visuals are concerned.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we thought that the last Re-Pac release was perfectly solid slice of PS1 platforming, even if it did play things a little too safe. Here's hoping that the sequel can muster up something a little more imaginative.</p>
