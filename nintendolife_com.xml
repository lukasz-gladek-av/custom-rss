<p>It's Fortnite-ing time</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At last, the Power Rangers are making their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> debut later this week on 7th August.</p>
<p>There's been rumours about the Rangers dropping in the free-to-play battle royale for a while, and today's trailer confirms when <em>and</em> what to expect. They'll be landing in-game during Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock 'N Awesome. Oh, and did we mention that the trailer is incredible?</p>
<p>Featuring a blend of CGI and live action, we get an introduction to the Bad Bugs which Fortnite characters are battling in CGI. Then, the Red, Blue, and Yellow Rangers arrive and we get a cut to live action and a change in aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Butt rock music, over-the-top explosions and action, and martial arts-style stunts all accompanied by Peely; it's a little surreal to see the '90s era of Power Rangers alongside iconic Fortnite characters. But goodness, is this trailer great, especially if you grew up watching the show.</p>
<p>Later in the month, the Mighty Morphin Bundle will be hitting the in-game store, where you'll be able to unlock Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger, and Blue Ranger outfits and iconic accessories.</p>

<p>If you're a Battle Pass holder, you'' also have access to a series of quests which kick off on 16th September; completing these will unlock the Dino Megazord outfit. Megazord will also be arriving mid-season for a takeover.</p>
<p>So it sounds like this is a no-brainer for Power Rangers fans, then. That trailer <em>might</em> have some of us downloading the game on Switch 2 right now; that version is pretty good, too!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>When Harold Ryan, former Bungie CEO and president, formed his new studio <a href="https://www.probablymonsters.com/">ProbablyMonsters</a> in 2016, he remarked how that the aim was to transform how AAA games are developed, hoping to create a more sustainable environment for creators to, well, create in.</p>
<p>Now, the fledgling studio has announced its first two games, one of which is coming to Nintendo Switch. And indeed, it's <em>specifically</em> for Switch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a> is a side-scrolling roguelike that's due to hit Nintendo's console "this fall" and, as Ryan himself explains in the game's official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These games represent the first public expression of the approach we’ve been shaping behind the scenes...We’ve always believed there’s a better way to make games, one that supports original IP, empowers developers, and delivers memorable experiences to players. How we bring games to life has evolved. We’ve had to adapt, and these first two titles reflect a model that’s more focused, flexible, and sustainable. This is just the start, and we’re excited to finally share them with the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all sounds great, and Ryan also points out that, in order to fit the remit, Storm Lancers' run time comes in at a very manageable 10 hours. Music to our ears, to be quite honest.</p>
<p>A quick look around the <a href="https://www.probablymonsters.com/stormlancers/">game's official webpage</a> shows a cartoonish and very colourful-styled adventure that puts us in mind of a side-scrolling <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands</a> in a few of the screenshots, and the launch trailer, which you can see above, really does show off some very moreish looking two-player action.</p>
<p>Co-op is where it's at, and judging by how many upgrades and weapons we see in that brief launch trailer, folk who like tinkering their gear and setups before diving into co-operative runs, may well be in for a very good time. Here's some further info from ye olde PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storm Lancers is a rogue-like game inspired by 1980s anime and cartoons that features combo-focused fights and couch co-op. Led by industry veterans Jim Veevaert (Microsoft, Zynga) and Seth Thompson (Blizzard), Storm Lancers combines fluid combat with unstoppable momentum. Designed to keep the heart racing and reflexes sharpened, the game gives players a sense of adventure constantly on the move. Set in the world of Cryptica, players crash land on a living planet built around a powerful source of reality magic. As they traverse five ever-shifting biomes, each leap, slash, and dash propels them deeper into a vibrant world, only to be met by enemies that adapt to their every move.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Storm Lancers can be played solo, the press release really is super keen to point out that it really is designed to shine in couch co-op where, "Two players can team up to explore the alien world together, developing complementary playstyles as they battle through merciless enemies and terrifying bosses.</p>
<p>Along the way, players collect items that transform and define their approach to combat, making each run unique and replayable." So, just like a standard Saturday night out in Glasgow, then.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some screenshots.</p>
