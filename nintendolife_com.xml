<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/742cea9f6aa0d/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has today received its first major game update, bumping it up to Version 1.1.0.</p>
<p>It's been previously noted how this title was lacking modes and certain features, and it seems this latest update has improved the overall experience. For starters, it's now possible to play local wireless games (supporting up to 8 players), and apart from this, there are some handy updates to the game's 'Online' mode and fixes to go with it.</p>
<p>As usual, here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0oiptuk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<li>It is now possible to select either Set as Blue or Blue/Red for Your Team Color.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusted certain depictions, including the game-start animations, lighting within parks, and the time the lights are lit up when at top speed.</li>
<li>The game will now display version information.
<ul>
<li>Select the Help tab of the X Menu to view it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Online</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>You can join the wait list from the list found under Friend park on the Mode tab of the X Menu.</li>

</ul>

<li>Made adjustments to increase the chances of 3-on-3 games in public parks.</li>

<li>The game will now display the score when using the spectator camera.</li>
<li>Like offline bots, online bots will now pass to players when they raise their hands or use the “Hey” reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes no record is made under Search for Users You’ve Played With.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes crash when starting up the game or heading to a park.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the shot success rate for shots made immediately before landing was based on the position where the shot was made.</li>
</ul>
<p>The success rate for shots is affected by the distance to the hoop (how close the player is to the hoop) and the player’s orientation towards the hoop (how directly the player is facing the hoop).</p>
<p>In order to make it so that bunny-hop shots while approaching did not become excessively advantageous, the intended design was to calculate shot success rate for distance to the hoop based on the last point of contact with the ground (the jumping off point).</p>
<p>However, just for when the player took a shot immediately before landing, the shot success rate was being calculated based on the position where the shot was made, which was not intended, so we have fixed this.</p>
<p>However, there are no changes to the success rate for orientation towards the hoop.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can find out more about this game in our review here on Nintendo Life. If not, here's a quick sample where we said it was a well-made sports game, even with the lack of options and control hurdles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans."</p>

<p>According to the game's director Naoki Hamaguchi, Square Enix is planning to release a demo for Nintendo's new system by the end of this year. Speaking to Inverse recently, he mentioned how it should help players who are still "unsure" if this enhanced release is right for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wanted to mention that at the end of the year, a demo is coming out for Switch 2 and Xbox. Players who might still be on the fence or unsure about playing, it’d be great for them to experience."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds how it will also give players the chance to "feel the full specs" of the game on the Switch 2. This demo is once again planned for "the end of the year", so if we hear any formal announcements or updates from Square Enix between now and then, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Last month, Square Enix confirmed this game would run at a "stable 30 frames per second" on the Switch 2, while "offering smooth performance and crisp visuals".</p>

<p>The next entry arrives on Switch 2 in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's amiibo series has got a boost in recent times, thanks to games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> package.</p>
<p>Third-party developers such as Capcom have also continued to build the amiibo line. And now, following its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> series, the same company is teasing at least three new amiibo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>This game is due out next year on 13th March 2026, so we'll likely see them show up on this date, or at least nearby. This information comes from this year's Tokyo Game Show, with the company displaying these unannounced amiibo at its booth this week (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1npv7fv/tokyo_game_show_mh/">Amiibo News via MonsterHunter subreddit</a>):</p>

<p>Capcom previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_stories">Monster Hunter Stories</a> amiibo for the second entry in the series. These were released during the Switch generation and included Ena, Razewing Ratha and Tsukino, and all of them were released alongside the game. There was also a series for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/07/monster_hunter_stories_gets_three_shiny_new_amiibo_figures">original 3DS release</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this latest amiibo update, Capcom has shared an "extended cut" of the Monster Hunter Stories 3 release date trailer. The launch date was originally shared earlier this month during the Nintendo Direct broadcast. Here's a bit about this new version of the trailer, and you can see it in action at the top of this page.</p>
<blockquote>

<figure><a title="Bowser &amp; Doug Bowser" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9246706593a32/bowser-and-doug-bowser.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that the President and Chief Operating Officer of Nintendo of America Doug Bowser will be retiring at the end of the year, on 31st December 2025.</p>
<p>His replacement has already been named — Devon Pritchard, who has been at NoA for 19 years and is currently the Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing &amp; Communications. As part of the move, Pritchard will also be joining the NoA Board of Directors and will become a Nintendo Co., Ltd Executive Officer when she takes over.</p>
<p>Other changes are coming, too: Satoru Shibata will be taking over as Chief Executive Officer, in addition to maintaining his position as Managing Executive Officer and Corporate Director of the NCL. Shibata has been the president of Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo of Australia previously.</p>
<p>Bowser's departure is a bit of a surprise to us — he joined the company back in 2015 as the Vice President of Sales &amp; Marketing, before taking over as President of NoA in April 2019 after Reggie Fils-Aimé stepped down.</p>
<p>Here is his statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong. Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President of Nintendo, Shuntaro Furukawa, has thanked Bowser for his work with the company, saying that he brought "smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo."</p>
<p>"I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years." Furukawa continues, "I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles.”</p>
<p>Pritchard, who will be stepping into her new role on 1st January 2026, says that “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish."</p>
<p>Her history with the company has been varied, with roles across Business Affairs, Marketing, and Publisher Relations, and her aim is to put Nintendo fans first: "With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>We wish Doug Bowser all of the best for the future, and we're excited to see Pritchard step into the role.</em><em><br></em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement]]></content:encoded>
