<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Nintendo Racers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7725d4c79231/mario-kart-world-nintendo-racers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's no denying that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> packs a pretty impressive roster of racers (come on, 50 characters, <em>plus</em> costumes ain't bad), but we'd be foolish if we didn't pour one out for the familiar faces that were lost along the way. We're talking, of course, about the <del>Koopalings</del> wider Nintendo characters that got cosy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, but missed out on the starting line this time around.</p>
<p>Link, Isabelle, the Villagers and the Inklings no longer grace the character select screen in World, and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">Ouest-France</a>, producer Kosuke Yabuki explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>According to Yabuki-san, the Mario Kart World development team felt the line-up was already beefy enough, <em>without</em> Link and co. in tow. "As developers, it would have seemed incongruous to us to add characters from other games into this universe," he told the French outlet (via Google Translate), "And it didn't seem necessary to us, given everything we could already do with Mario".</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/this-is-it-nintendo-on-why-it-added-cow-into-mario-kart-world">Ask the Developer interview</a> gave us some insight into how excited the developers were to add the likes of Cow to the game, so it makes sense that the team would want to keep going with as many Mario regulars as possible. We'd be on that character select screen all day if they started adding lil guys from <em>every</em> Nintendo franchise, after all.</p>
<p>And, let's admit it, we've all gone crazy for some of these newbies, regardless of where they came from. "The reception has been so warm that it surprised even us," Yabuki-san told Ouest-France, "It definitely exceeded our expectations".</p>
<p>"We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this casting," Yabuki-san concluded, "But there are so many characters and so many costumes that every player is sure to find something to suit them".</p>
<p>Part of us assumed that Mario Kart would balloon into some sort of Smash-style 'Nintendo Kart' for the next entry, so it's actually pretty refreshing to see the Big N go in the opposite direction. And besides, who's choosing Link over Monty Mole?</p>

<p>Display has "blurring characteristics that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch’s display"</p>

<figure><a title="Digital Foundry Is &quot;Happy&quot; With Switch 2, But Feels The Screen Is &quot;Problematic&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20b1277270269/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The tech boffins over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Digital Foundry</a> have delivered their final verdict on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">Switch 2</a>, and it's mostly positive—but the console's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">LCD screen</a> has been found wanting.</p>
<p>In his review, Digital Foundry boss and games media veteran Richard Leadbetter says that, overall, he's "happy" with Nintendo's new hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being significantly larger than Switch 1, the thinness of the handheld remains much the same, making it feel significantly less bulky than Steam Deck and other PC handhelds. Similarly, the bigger screen can make for a more immersive experience and colour reproduction is significantly improved over the original model. What’s also surprising – and highly appreciated – is the number of games that either run at native 1080p in handheld mode (like Mario Kart World, for example) or use DLSS to upscale to 1080p, delivering pleasing results.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter likes the hardware in general, taking time to praise the new Joy Con controllers and even citing the "little ‘feet’ on the bottom of the unit" as praise-worthy. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-are-you-excited-at-all-for-switch-2-gamechat">GameChat</a> also gets a positive appraisal. "This is the original Switch revised and refined into a generally more pleasing and more effective unit, delivering a proper generational upgrade with highly impressive efficiency."</p>

<p>However, the console's LCD display—<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/switch-2-launching-this-year-with-8-inch-lcd-screen-according-to-new-analyst-rumour">a point of contention even before the console was released</a>—proved "problematic in a number of ways" for the industry vet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo promised HDR, but an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 nits will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range experience with the signature HDR contrast and highlights almost completely absent in handheld play. Even more disappointing is motion quality: the Switch 2 LCD has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">blurring characteristics</a> that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch’s display. Side by side with the Switch OLED panel, the key problems with Nintendo’s choice for Switch 2 come into sharp focus – it’s simply nowhere near as good.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>There are clear problems with Switch 2’s VRR (variable refresh rate) functionality too. Now, in theory, we believe that there’s no reason why it should not work effectively. The Switch 2 Welcome Tour software includes a VRR showcase that demonstrates what we think is a 40-120Hz VRR window, but crucially it also reveals support for LFC – low frame-rate compensation – outside of that window. A fully featured VRR on Switch 2 is possible!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another minor grumble relates to the length of the supplied USB-C cables, which Leadbetter feels simply aren't long enough.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Back Page: Every Game Should Have A Cow]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/back-page-every-game-should-have-a-cow</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/back-page-every-game-should-have-a-cow.1225209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="We love Cow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c9dcef21db1d/we-love-cow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>In the magazine business, the Back Page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Some may call it "filler"; we prefer "a whole page to make terrible jokes that are tangentially related to the content of the mag".</em></p>
<p><em>We don't have pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes — so welcome to our semi-regular feature, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/back-page">Back Page</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I know what you're thinking. You just read that headline, and you said out loud to yourself: "Yes! I completely agree with this sentence. Never before have truer words been written onto the hallowed pages of the internet. All other journalists should pack up and quit, because this is the pinnacle of the craft; it simply does not get better from here."</p>
<p>I know. But I pitched 1,000 words, and so, that's what you'll get, even though you already agree with me. Woe! Such is my life.</p>
<p>So, here are a few examples of what every game on Switch could look like if they got smart, took a page out of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s book, and realised that what the world needs is 'More Cow'.</p>
<h2>Super Smash Bros.</h2>
<figure><a title="Smash Bros with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83f38ad7f2b6a/smash-bros-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The great thing about Cow in SSB is that no one wants to beat up Cow — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"I main Kirby."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I've memorised every single Toon Link move."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can beat you with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back as any one of the indistinguishable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors">Fire Emblem</a> characters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Who cares</em>? Most of the characters in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros</a>. have opposable thumbs, or, at the very least, little hand-nubs like Jigglypuff and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> Villager. Fighting is pretty much a fist-based sport. You're all playing with the training wheels on.</p>
<p>And do you know what that means? Only <em>true</em> SSB aficionados would choose Cow – a character with no fists. Or arms. Cow doesn't even have an angry game-face, just a placid, terrifying smile, ready to strike fear into the hearts of every opponent like Pikachu wishes he could.</p>
<p>Bonus: you can refer to Cow as having a "moo-veset".</p>
<h3>Metroid</h3>
<figure><a title="Metroid with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43bdd945205a8/metroid-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mootroid Moosion. Samoos Aran. Et cetera — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so, you know the Metroids? The iconic jellyfish-like aliens from the series, which Samus has to kill and/or learn to love? Very scary and/or cute, right?</p>
<p>Sure, sure. But hear me out: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> is one of the most frequently played speedruns at the various Games Done Quick tournaments, and do you know what part gets the audience most excited? It's a little detour called <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/125534/what-is-super-metroids-save-or-kill-the-animals-incentive-sgdq-2021">Save the Animals</a>, where the speedrunner has to take precious seconds out of their time returning to an early room to free a bunch of space-birds and space-monkeys before the planet explodes, extinguishing all extant life.</p>
<p>So, we know people who play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> love animals. Why not give them what they really want – SPACE-COWS? Samus could ride them through the levels instead of having to Morph-Ball everywhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/seriously-what-the-heck-is-going-on-inside-samusr-morph-ball">which can't be good for her spine</a>.</p>
<h3>Splatoon</h3>
<figure><a title="Splatoon with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c4cf19b41a7d8/splatoon-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look! The three flavours of milk! This game designs itself, really — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I commend Nintendo for discovering the fun combination of squids and ink, but let's be real: it could be any animal and the fluid it produces. Bees and honey. Horses and sweat. Hippos and blood. Why not cows and milk?</p>
<p>Imagine this: you're playing a game of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> (Spilt Milk Edition), and you've dressed up your cow in cool sunglasses and legwarmers. You load up your milk gun, which is directly attached to your character's udders, and let rip, spraying fresh 3.5% all over the floor like you think the dirt is cereal. You take out one of the enemy team (whose milk is a chocolatey brown) in a slippy, creamy massacre, before diving into the white stuff and swimming through curds to get to their base and cover it in dairy graffiti.</p>
<p>Doesn't that sound fun, and not at all horrendous?</p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda</h3>
<figure><a title="Breath of the Wild with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6dab908154b85/breath-of-the-wild-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I put an extra Cow in this image so they can be friends — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know cows already exist in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">LoZ</a> world, but they're usually cooped up on Lon Lon Ranch, stuck in underground caves, or getting abducted by aliens, and they always look <em>so sad</em>. Let's give Hyrule's cows the recognition they deserve by promoting them to Series Regular. I've already got someone in mind to demote: Epona.</p>
<p>Put away the pitchforks! Epona can still stick around, just in a lesser role. It's not like Link's never replaced her before – remember that motorbike in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_-_the_champions_ballad_plus_expansion_pass">Breath of the Wild</a>? That's not a <em>whole</em> lot different to a cow, really.</p>
<p>Besides, Epona doesn't give you delicious, HP-restoring milk. That's a point in Cow's favour.</p>
<h3>Star Fox</h3>
<figure><a title="Star Fox with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ed91ece7126e9/star-fox-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>MOO a barrel roll <i title=":smiley:"></i> — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Slippy's a frog. Peppy's a bunny. Falco's a bird. Sure, I can suspend my disbelief enough to believe that woodland creatures can A) exist in space, B) fly spacecraft, and C) toss witty banter at one another long enough to become friends, but do you know what I <em>don't</em> believe? That there are no cows in space.</p>
<p>You're telling me that an animal LITERALLY KNOWN FOR BEING ABDUCTED BY ALIENS doesn't exist in space? And that it wouldn't have encyclopaedic knowledge of spaceships, having been on so many? I don't buy it! Aliens, much like me, love cows, and there's a good reason for that: they make great astronauts.</p>
<p>Give Slippy, Peppy, Falco and co. a cow friend, call it Milktopher Cow or whatever, and give the people what they want.</p>
<h3>Balatro</h3>
<figure><a title="Balatro with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7504f122ebc3/balatro-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wouldn't Balatro make you 50% less grumpy if all the cards were cows? Yes. — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sure, why not! LocalThunk has done so many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a> collabs already – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a>, and more – why not a cow deck?</p>
<p>There's already a cow-adjacent Joker ("The Bull"), so I feel like LocalThunk might be amenable to more cow cards.</p>
<p>Was this an excuse to draw my own cow cards? Yes. Yes it was.</p>
<h3>Nintencows</h3>
<figure><a title="Nintendogs with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dfd1eedc59ac3/nintendogs-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Genius — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>. But with cows.</p>
<hr>
<p>You herd it here first, folks: these are just some of the games that would be better with nature's most beautiful and beefiest ungulates. Do you have suggestions for how to <em>steer</em> the industry in the bovine direction? Let us know in the comments.</p>
