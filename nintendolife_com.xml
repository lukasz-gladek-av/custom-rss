<p>Only 4000 copies up for grabs</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We love ourselves a bit of Yacht Club Games' stupendously good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> series, and 2022's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a>, a collaboration with the maestros at Nitrome, even managed to swipe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shovel-knight-dig">a rather excellent 9/10 in our review</a>, where we concluded that the game "positively oozes quality, whether that be the snappy action-platforming or the fresh 16-bit art style and animation."</p>
<p>Now, Super Rare Games has announced that a limited physical edition of this roguelike belter will be made available via its official website <a href="https://superraregames.com/products/srg-146-shovel-knight-dig-switch">right here</a> at <strong>6pm BST / 1pm EST</strong> on <strong>8th January 2026</strong>. Hey, that's this Thursday!</p>
<p>As you'll note if you head over to the site right now, the game isn't yet up for pre-order just yet, so with only 4,000 units to shift (and a limit of two copies per customer in place) we reckon anyone interested should be fairly swift in nabbing a copy once it goes live.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c971fd9affea"><a title="Shovel Knight Dig physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c971fd9affea/shovel-knight-dig-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Super Rare Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The physical edition of Shovel Knight Dig comes with a full colour manual, exclusive sticker, a set of three trading cards and a "fully assembled Nintendo Switch game with cartridge." Whatever that is (psst, the full game on the cart).</p>
<p>Sounds pretty tasty and, if you happen to have forgotten the ins and outs of this one since it released (hey, three years is a long time ago in this economy), here's some further quick-fire deets to refresh your memory from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>
💎 An all-new presentation featuring a new Shovel Knight story! When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight’s peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>👾 The first Shovel Knight adventure in glorious high color pixel graphics and sound. Fluid animation, scaling, rotation, and parallax create the most convincing Shovel Knight world yet!</p>
<p>🔄️ Every adventure is different! Shovel Knight Dig levels have been meticulously crafted, then stitched together using proprietary generation techniques for infinite replayability.</p>
<p>🪏 Jump, slash, and dig your way in an all-new direction - down! Rely on your trusty Shovel Drop, then dig through huge swaths of dirt with all-new Speed Shovel mechanics.</p>
<p>🦾 Grow in power and wealth as you descend into the depths of the earth. Emerge with untold riches to outfit Shovel Knight further, unlocking permanent items and upgrades to your Shoveling equipment.</p>
<p>⚜️ New Knights, new characters, and new enemies abound, but fear not! Shovel Knight Dig features Shovel Knight’s signature storytelling, humor, and maybe even some familiar faces</p>
<p>🎵 Another pulse-pounding soundtrack in a new style by astonishing virtuoso Jake Kaufman!</p>

Special Edition</a> launched on Switch 1 back in 2024, and surprise! Limited Run Games has brought it back again for Nintendo's new hybrid with a host of hot upgrades.</p>
<p>As revealed in a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3mboiujxgzj2x">Bluesky</a>, this Switch 2 Edition packs in increased resolution and "improved performance" — though the frame rate specifics were not given. You can also expect higher quality assets from this release and a "downsampled display mode".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version is now available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-special-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> for <strong>$19.99</strong>. LRG doesn't appear to be offering any Upgrade Path options between the consoles at the time of writing, but we will be sure to update this post if that changes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tlpmsv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>For those who missed the initial release, here's a quick summary of Tomba's key features and a handful of screenshots from its new eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Save Anywhere! No more worrying about heading back to a checkpoint.<br>
-Rewind - Stuck on a difficult challenge? Try again!<br>
-Toggle for analog control<br>
-A museum crammed with classic print advertisements, original packaging and manuals, never- before-seen dev documents, and high-res original artwork<br>
-A new remastered soundtrack<br>
-Interview with the creator, Tokuro Fujiwara</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Switch 2 release of 'Tomba 1' lands mere weeks after Limited Run Games launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomba-2-the-evil-swine-return-special-edition">Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return Special Edition</a> on both hybrid consoles. What a time to be a Tomba fan, eh?</p>

<p>Announced during a Nintendo Direct in September 2025, Pokémon Pokopia sees you play as a Ditto that's transformed to look like a human. You'll work to build a bustling town by gathering crafting materials and using iconic Pokémon moves to transform the land around you. Essentially, it seems to be the Pokémon-themed sim game many have been waiting for.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, folks who purchase the game early can also redeem a free in-game Ditto rug via the Mystery Gift feature. This will be valid until 31st January 2027.</p>

<p>As revealed in a post from the game's <a href="https://x.com/FFT_TIC/status/2008358164459102588">Twitter account</a>, The Ivalice Chronicles has surpassed 1 million copies sold across all platforms in just three months, which isn't bad going for a remake of a '90s tactical RPG.</p>
