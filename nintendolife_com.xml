<figure><a title="WAYP SILKSONG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1aae10e995fdd/wayp-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Aloha, amigos, and welcome shorts fans, to another weekend. It's been a very, very quiet one this week, with no games of note to menti...oh, hold on. Wait. We've actually been inundated with bangers. I'm terribly sorry.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has finally materialised. It's a real game that you can play right now! In fact, it's so real that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-switch-eshop-and-steam-are-buckling-under-the-weight-of-silksong">crashed a bunch of online stores when it dropped</a>, causing both the eShop and Steam to struggle for a prolonged period.</p>
<p>We've also had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, an adventure that had us all worried during the week with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-force-isnt-strong-with-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-initial-impressions-suggest">rumoured poor performance on Switch 2</a>, arriving in splendid form. Utinni indeed, small furry warrior. Of course, game-key cards have also been front and centre in the wake of Outlaws' release; folk continue to rally against them, although explanations for why they are used in this case <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">are showing up</a> to muddy the argument waters even further.</p>
<p>Away from the heady heights of those two games, which we're sure most folk will spend this weekend diving into, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> has also just gone live. We'll have a review of that one ASAP - but early impressions do seem to point to, well, the early impressions from the internet are 60fps and/or under 30fps depending where you read 'em, so stick with us and we'll know for sure very shortly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, with Atari's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> also on this week's ticket, there's certainly a decent spread of games to be getting on with playing, whether you're into walking around knocking wee balls into holes on nicely mowed lawns, or CQC'ing stormtroopers just because you can.</p>
<p>So, without any further interruption, let's have a look at what some of the Nintendo Life team are playing this weekend. Namaste.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187446,187479 @ 1757163682 -->
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I've been having a space-whale of a time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> this week, and I'm very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, which I've managed a few hours on already. However, my weekend is gonna be mostly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a>, which I've already been playing through early access on PS5, so I'm very interested to see how it shapes up on Switch 2. Expect a review of that shortly!</p>
<p>Otherwise, yeah, it's gonna be me and my two absolutely enthralled sons (who somehow seem to know all the Hollow Knight lore, despite having not played it), sat in front of a TV for Team Cherry's latest. Not a bad plan.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I will be mostly playing the things I was playing last week. Namely, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, and a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a>. I just finished up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> (look out for a review soon), so it's back to Hallownest for the most part.</p>
<p>And given the positive reaction to the Switch port, I'm also keen to check out the other recent Star **** game, Outlaws. We'll see if I can squeeze that in too.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Since the game is out now, I don’t mind telling you that I’ll be playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> this weekend in an effort to get a review ready as soon as possible. I won’t go into too much detail now, but I’m enjoying it so far – it’s cool.</p>
<p>And of course I’m playing Silksong! I got really caught up in the hype on launch day and I’m glad I did. It’s really quite good. I get lost quite a bit and there’s one mini-boss that’s giving me a real headache, but I shall persevere.</p>
<h2>Damien McFerran, Editorial Director</h2>
<p>Having successfully avoided it for almost a decade, I'm actually getting around to playing the original Hollow Knight this week. I reasoned that, in 2025, resistance was useless; if I want to be part of the Silksong conversation, I need to play the first game before I can dip into the sequel, right?</p>
<p>So far, I'm loving it – in fact, I'm now at the point where I can't believe I sat on this game for so long. The music! The visuals! The dialogue! The challenge! It's like two of my favourite games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-its-about-time-castlevania-symphony-of-the-night-came-to-switch">SotN</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, had a baby and left it on my doorstep, and I cruelly left said baby on said doorstep for ages before finally bringing it in from the cold. Forgive me, Team Cherry!</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>Hornet has bound me to play Hollow Knight: Silksong for eternity. Well, it could be much, much worse... Fortunately, she is letting me go out and celebrate my partner's birthday with family this weekend, so that's good.</p>
<p>Check back for my review soon!</p>

<p>Free and paid DLC is on the way</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> launched for the Switch 2 earlier this week, and now that the game is available, the team has gone into detail about the post-launch content on the way.</p>
<p>This includes a free roadmap update, which will add content from October through to December, along with some paid content. The free DLC starts on 2nd October 2025 with a new boss and cosmetic item. This will be followed by another two new bosses and cosmetic items in the same month, and later in December, three more new bosses will be added.</p>
<p>The paid "Into the Abyss" Expansion Pack is also scheduled to be released at some point in November.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9edff6b020ef1/daemon-x-machina.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In our review we said this game was a decent mech experience, even if it was a bit clunky in some parts. A Switch 2 demo is also available to download on the eShop, if you want to try the first nine chapters of the game and freely explore the open world. Multiplayer support is also included and save data will carry over to the full release.</p>
