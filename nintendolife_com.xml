<figure data-uuid="692a8a4c594a5"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/692a8a4c594a5/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf">financial data</a> for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, confirming that the Switch 2 has now sold an astonishing <strong>17.37 million units</strong> since launch in June 2025. <em>17.37 million</em><em>!</em></p>
<p>If you remember, Nintendo increased its forecast for Switch 2 sales back in November 2025 from 15 million to 19 million. Honestly, that seemed a tad overly-ambitious to us at the time, but it seems the Switch 2 will have absolutely no trouble smashing through its target by the time the fiscal year is out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Nintendo has also showcased a rather lovely graphic to demonstrate how fast the Switch 2 is selling compared to the Switch. Note that this has the Switch 2 at 15 million units, but specific figures in Nintendo's dedicated unit sales page has it at 17.37 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="30e5a02f32d62"><a title="Sales Chart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30e5a02f32d62/sales-chart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software is also sitting pretty at a total of <strong>37.93 million</strong> units, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> taking the lead at 14.03 units shifted. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> managed a total of 4.25 million, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> performed admirably at 1.76 million. Curiously, Nintendo has opted to make no mention of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Hmm, troubling.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the money is going up, up, and up. Net sales for the nine months of FY26 so far are up by 99.3% at a total of 1,905.8 billion yen, while operating profit is up 21.3% at 300.3 billion yen. There are no new changes to the hardware or software forecast for the remainder of the year, and Nintendo has singled out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> as games to watch out for in February and March.</p>
<p>We'll definitely look forward to those, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Switch 2 Edition</a> and the currently undated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>.

<p>If you haven't already seen our own review and score, we gave this reimagined release nine out of ten stars, calling it the "most fun version" of this particular entry yet, and well worth a look if you're a fan of "high-quality, old-school JRPG" action.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/19437-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-review">RPG Site - 7/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined still encapsulates much of what makes Dragon Quest VII resonant, but with every possible edge sanded off. It succeeds at streamlining a lengthy adventure at the expense of player discovery and friction. Besides being able to reach the credits more quickly, I find it difficult to declare this version as an improvement on what came before."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.vooks.net/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-switch-2-review/">Vooks - 4.5/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined revitalises an old classic with a loving overhaul to allow everyone to enjoy this adventure across time. This new take comes with a lovely visual style and other additions and tweaks to bring this story to a new generation."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-review">IGN - 7/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined delivers a better-paced version of this 26-year-old classic while retaining its signature charm, but it also goes too far with some of its changes, sanding down the experience for newer players at the expense of the challenge and discovery"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/74110/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-switch-2-review">Nintendo World Report - 7.5/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined is a beautifully designed turn-based RPG that is much more approachable to new players than the 3DS remake in 2016, but it may leave fans of earlier versions feeling slighted...Even though there aren’t any glaring problems with this remake, it never felt as satisfying to play as the HD-2D games or Dragon Quest 11, so be prepared for a noticeably different experience compared to those RPGs."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-ps5/">CGMagazine - 8.5/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined rectifies one of the slower entries into the long-running series with a next-gen coat of paint and pacing to match the sensibilities of contemporary JRPG enthusiasts."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It’s time for everyone to finally stand up and agree that <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> is one of the best games in the series. <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> cements this by smoothing out some of the rough edges, keeping things moving, and giving us a look and a combat system that are the series’ absolute peak."</p>

<figure data-uuid="40062ef98b2c1"><a title="Magical Craft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40062ef98b2c1/magical-craft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Imagineer</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Imagineer and developer syn Sophia (the team behind Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_2_-_fashion_forward">Style Savvy</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_3_-_styling_star">New Style Boutique</a> series) announced a new Switch dressmaking game called <strong>Magical Craft</strong>. It's already been released in Japan late last year, and now, in an update, an ESRB listing has surfaced.</p>
<p>No local release has been announced just yet, but if this rating is any indication, it seems we could be getting some news soon. The developer is the same Japanese team behind the 2023 Marvelous Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fashion_dreamer">Fashion Dreamer</a>. It also more recently helped Imagineer with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3</a>.</p>
<p>In this title, you gather fabrics, motif patterns and other items to make dresses, with "over 100,000 possible designs". To complete each dress, you'll play through mini-games featuring four kinds of sewing magic, and your villagers can then wear your creations.</p>
<p>Here's an official description about the game's protagonist and story (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dressmaking-adventure-game-magical-craft-neko-to-mahou-no-dress-announced-for-switch">via Gematsu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story unfolds in the tranquil village of Frune. The protagonist, a young girl named Lilia, begins her journey as a dressmaker, using the “sewing magic” she inherited from her grandmother. As she fulfills requests from the villagers and works toward becoming a legendary dressmaker, her everyday life of dressmaking begins."</p>

<p>If we hear any updates about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>And it's "no comment" on "why separate SKUs were not possible"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="06fa2bb960801"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/06fa2bb960801/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of the superhero workplace comedy game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> on Switch and Switch 2 hasn't exactly panned out as expected.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, there has been a lot of back-and-forth over the past week about censorship in the Nintendo versions of the game. It resulted in the developer AdHoc Studio sharing multiple comments, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">Nintendo issued a formal statement</a>.</p>
<p>The previous update from the studio said the plan was to "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/people-have-a-right-to-be-pd-dispatch-dev-says-it-intends-to-address-at-least-some-censored-switch-content">address at least some of the censored content</a>" in the Switch and Switch 2 releases going forward. Now, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57271-dispatch-devs-say-uncensored-physical-switch-release-not-possible-can-t-comment-on">GoNintendo</a> has asked about the possibility of a "fully uncensored" physical version of the game on Nintendo platforms, but apparently, this won't be happening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GoNintendo:</strong> Unfortunately the answer isn’t one we hoped for. Our point of contact told us there is <em>“no possibility for a physical version to be released without the adjusted content.”</em> They also went on to say that the discussion isn’t <em>“currently relevant as there are no announcements regarding a physical release at this time.”</em> That is very much true, but you might remember that in our interview with Natalie Herman, Lead Producer on Dispatch, we asked about the potential for a physical release. Herman responded by saying, <em>“Let’s just say we’ve dreamed of Dispatch in a shiny red case. We have a lot of physical media fans on our team.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same site also asked about the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">singular worldwide release discussion</a>" doing the rounds online and reportedly got the following response back from AdHoc's PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“AdHoc is legally unable to provide further comment on why separate SKUs were not possible for different regions.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there are any other significant developments or comments made, we'll provide an update. You can find out more about Dispatch and the censored content in the Switch versions of the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review and previous stories</a> here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Pokémon Day is taking place later this month, and ahead of this annual event, Nintendo has announced its US-based stores located in New York and San Francisco will be hosting special events.</p>
<p>They're inviting trainers to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary, which will take place on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.

<p>Following a special Nintendo Direct broadcast last week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, Nintendo is now celebrating the series on its music app this week with the release of the 3DS soundtrack.</p>
<p>This 3DS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> game was locally released in 2014. The soundtrack contains a <em>whopping</em> <strong>210 tracks</strong>, with a runtime of 3 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Oh Mii oh my! Songs from the Nintendo 3DS game Tomodachi Life are now available on the Nintendo Music app... Featuring tracks such as Afternoon on the Island, Mii Apartments, and more."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka (who was recently credited for music in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>) and former Nintendo composer Asuka Itō, who contributed to multiple other Nintendo projects throughout the 3DS generation.</p>

<p>As usual, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription to listen to the soundtrack on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> mobile app. If you didn't catch last week's Direct about the new Switch game, be sure to check out our previous coverage. This new title launches this April.</p>
