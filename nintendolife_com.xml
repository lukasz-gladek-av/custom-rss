<p>She ain't no Odd Rock</p>

<figure><a title="DK Bananza 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e21dc5f3ea534/dk-bananza-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Direct</a> from Nintendo revealed that DK's new companion, Odd Rock, isn't actually Odd Rock at all, but rather a young Pauline. Gasp!</p>
<p>We all kind of knew this was coming, of course, thanks to a previous leak, but it's still pretty cool to see just how vital she'll prove to be with the overarching story.</p>
<p>Thanks to a new page via the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Store</a>, even more details regarding Pauline have been revealed, including her age. According to a very brief summary of her character, she is 13 years old at the time she encounters DK in Bananza.</p>
<p>Translated via Google, the sumary reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A 13-year-old girl who loves to sing. She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and turned into a rock."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Pauline - DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fdc75f17bb9a/pauline-dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Direct revealed that Pauline can use her singing abilities to point DK in the right direction during gameplay, while also transforming him into one of three new forms: Kong Bananza, Zebra Bananza, and Ostrich Bananza.</p>
<p>Co-op play is also supported, with a second player taking on the role of Pauline to sing out deadly words to defeat enemies and blast away chunks of the environment. GameShare has also been confirmed for DK Bananza, with users of Switch 1 consoles able to join the fun.</p>

Of course, there are also a bunch of bug fixes besides, to keep the play experience that bit smoother.</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179mnzrls&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<figure><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6751a32c7063/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo released a bunch of free Switch updates alongside the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this month but one issue that wasn't entirely resolved was tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Nintendo was only able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2-updates-for-multiple-first-party-switch-games-are-now-available">"partially" alleviate an issue</a> which occured when playing the game on the Switch 2, and the "entire screen" would flicker in several scenes. It mentioned in the previous patch notes how a fix was on the way, and today it's seemingly delivered on this promise with the Version 1.1.3 game update:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 3 Deluxe: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released June 16, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurs when playing on Nintendo Switch 2 where the entire screen will briefly turn off and on again in several scenes of the game, such as at the beginning and end of a day.</li>
<li>Several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how this particular problem has <em>not</em> been resolved in the Pikmin 3 Deluxe Demo, but a fix for this will be distributed alongside a full game update at some point in the future.</p>
<p>These are the only updates Pikmin 3 Deluxe has received for the Switch 2 so far and if there are any upgrades released, we'll let you know. Pikmin 3 is marked on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility list of games</a> with issues that have "been resolved, or are planned to be resolved by an update".</p>
<p>This follows on from an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9207bed9c7d34/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out a new system firmware update today for the Switch 2 and original model which bumps the hybrid family of devices up to Version 20.1.5.</p>
<p>This update officially kicks off the Switch 2's life with a stability update, but nothing else is revealed in these patch notes. This follows on from Version 20.1.1 which was released earlier this month and contained some minor fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown of the latest system update, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h3><a id="current" name="current">Ver. 20.1.5 (Released June 18, 2025)</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> suggests trying out any games that may have had issues to see how they're performing on this new firmware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm currently seeing reports that 20.1.5 fixes some Switch 1 games that previously didn't work on the Switch 2. If you have any problematic games, try them after updating!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is anything significant going on behind the scenes of this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>If you're not prompted to update your system, you can manually enter the system settings from the home menu on the Switch and Switch 2 to perform this update. You then navigate to the "system" option and perform a "system update" from here.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also been updating many of its games over the past week, including its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d56a77abbe84c/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has now aired its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct and sure enough, it had quite a few surprises to share.</p>
<p>This included the official reveal of Pauline, the return of many of Donkey Kong's old friends and additional features such as amiibo support and Game Share. Along with this, it looks like the gameplay will offer plenty of variety beyond destruction – with transformations, big boss battles, and much more.</p>
