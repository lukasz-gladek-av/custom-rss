<figure data-uuid="40b937d3cbf81"><a title="Sephiroth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40b937d3cbf81/sephiroth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, you made it! The weekend is here again, which means it's time to get some all-important gaming done.</p>
<p>Before that though, let's quickly recap the week. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">big review</a> was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> on the Switch 2, and as expected, it's a bit of a banger. We also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">heard from director Naoki Hamaguchi</a> who confirmed that the upcoming two sequels will have "exactly the same" gameplay as other platforms.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-gets-a-free-switch-2-update-and-adds-dixie-kong">surprise update</a>, which added in a bunch of improvements along with playable Dixie Kong. We got more information about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>'s Switch 2 update, and had a bit to say about its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/random-mario-wonders-new-box-art-might-be-the-ugliest-switch-2-edition-cover-yet">ugly-as-heck box art</a>.</p>
<p>So let's see what we're all up to, hm?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:196554,196505 @ 1769259712 -->
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I'll be diving into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cult_of_the_lamb">Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven</a>, which I'm quite excited about, as it's a chance for me to finally go back and finish the game - which I love, but I got distracted!</p>
<p>Beyond this, I'll be picking away at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a>, which I'm also really enjoying, and making some time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, which I've yet to touch. Loads of great stuff. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and I know there's been a lot of talk recently about how good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy Remake</a> looks on the Switch 2, and how its closest visual competitor is probably <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but man... Outlaws looks <em>really good</em>, too. Please give it a shot, if you haven't already.</p>
<p>And as teased last week, I have indeed jumped back into Zelda with... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>! Wheeey. Y'know what, I'm really enjoying it this time too. I'm just going slow, enjoying the sights and sounds, and not really bothering with much story stuff yet.</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>How has another week gone by so quickly? My theme for this week was “cosy-grinding” as I spent most of it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing New Horizons</a> or revisiting an old (and somewhat janky) favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/my_time_at_portia">My Time at Portia</a>. I've been trying to work through my huge backlog and Portia is on the top of my list to finish. Saying that, it'll take me a while because it's one I tend to play in short bursts.</p>
<p>This weekend however, I'm hoping to change it up with the Final Fantasy VII remake!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was too buried in everything else in 2020 to give Final Fantasy VII Remake a fair shot, so I have been counting down the days until I can properly dive into it on Switch 2. I’ll finally be seeing what it’s all about this weekend after the demo got me sufficiently intrigued a few weeks back, so I expect this will be my WAYP entry for a few weeks going forward.</p>
<p>See you on the other side, and all that!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>A triple dose of indie gems to play this weekend: The critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a>, the visually-striking MIO: Memories In Orbit and the clever nostalgia inducing Cassete Boy. I believe I will be done with Wings! Remastered Edition soon since I’m already in 1918. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will live in my head for a long time to come, truly an amazing achievement. What all those folks in the two hour long staff roll credits managed to pull of something special. It is now on the same level as my other favourite entry: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a>. I also picked up <strong>Rumble Roses XX</strong> on Xbox 360, another system exclusive game I always wanted to give a go.</p>
<p>Game of the week is to no surprise Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It has been a long time since this came out on rival platforms and an even longer time since I played the original on it’s European PS1 release. In my advanced age I no longer properly recall the plot, but... level up the flower-selling girl while giving her all the best materia and gear and Sephiroth does nothing wrong… right?</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Would you believe it, ACNH has gone an got its claws in me again. Having avoided crafting as much as possible (and never having cooked a thing in the game), I've been getting back into the swing of things, making a few items, and customising some pieces for my house, specifically for my Ten Forward-themed top room, which now has some nice long windows looking out at the stars.</p>
<p>Since last week, my kids have tents in the game, too, and I'm introducing them to the controls. I expect we'll spend a couple of hours pottering around the island, while I spend thousands of Bells on the clothes they want in the Able Sisters' place. Time to plant some more money trees. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>! I think I will be playing it forever. I have two endings so far, and no actual end in sight. I love it so much.</p>
<p>When I'm done with that, some time next century, I'm gonna give <strong>TR-49</strong> a go! I think I must be one of Inkle's biggest fans at this point, and after playtesting their last one, I made sure to go in almost completely blind to this one. Excited!</p>

<p>Last November, Sega announced three more characters for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. This included the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> IDW duo, Tangle and Whisper.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent interview with <a href="https://mcvuk.com/">MCV Magazine</a>, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka has reiterated how the team realises there is "a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe" which goes beyond the video games, and is apparently open to including even more "deep cut characters if the opportunity feels right".</p>

<p>Some of the more surprising Sonic character cameos in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds so far include select cast from the Netflix series <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-sonic-prime#:~:text=%22Sonic%20Prime%20is%20yet%20another,is%20a%20lot%20of%20fun.">Sonic Prime</a></strong>, and the bonus racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/02/sonic_unleashed_wii">Sonic the Werehog</a> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/sonic_unleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a>.

<p>Following the news of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-has-seemingly-confirmed-his-retirement">Kensuke Tanabe's retirement</a> earlier this week, it's now being reported game designer, director, producer, and Nintendo veteran Hideki Konno has also called time on his career at the Japanese firm.</p>
<p>According to an update on his Facebook page, Konno seemingly left the company in July 2025, but the news of his departure and apparent retirement has only been discovered now. He was at Nintendo for around 40 years and started as a designer and assistant director on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>.</p>
<p>Konno went on to direct multiple titles including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi's Island</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">Mario Kart 64</a>. He went on to lead his own group at <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Production_Group_No._9">Nintendo EPD</a> and played a role in the creation of the 3DS as the producer.</p>
<p>In more recent years, he acted as a producer on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, and helped run <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Smart_Device_Production_Group">Nintendo's mobile division</a>, working on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_heroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>. He also worked on the DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> for Switch and was recently given a "special thanks" credit in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1ef970e264e0a"><a title="Hideki Konno - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ef970e264e0a/hideki-konno-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This news once again follows the news of Kensuke Tanabe's reported retirement, who was known for his work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> series and many other Nintendo games throughout his career.</p>
<p>In some other industry news this week, Nintendo of America's new president and COO, Devin Pritchard, recently made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/im-excited-to-meet-you-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-public-appearance-as-president-of-noa">her first public appearance</a>. And the former president of this branch, Doug Bowser, has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/former-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-joins-hasbros-board-of-directors">joined the board of directors at Hasbro</a>.</p>
