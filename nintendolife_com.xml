<figure><a title="Toby Fox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf858058e69ad/toby-fox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>June 5th marked the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, but that very same day (or the day before on other consoles), the highly anticipated continuation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, in Chapters 3 and 4, also hit digital shelves.</p>
<p>If you've had the chance to catch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">our review</a>, you'll know we fully believe this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> "follow-up" is worth the new price of entry too, even if there are three more chapters to go. With big games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> ready and available for play, I've instead chose to sink more time into the indie darling that is Deltarune. It's silly yet simultaneously serious world and characters have their hooks in me and it's all I find myself thinking about night after night.</p><div><figure data-videoid="htp-VfCtJow" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c7531rkghwy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htp-VfCtJow" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To help me try and silence those voices and get a few extra hours of sleep, I was graciously given the chance to pepper Deltarune's creator, Toby Fox, with a few of the questions that have been knockin' about in my noggin. Did Toby answer my questions? Yes. Did he also take every opportunity to run in a different direction and troll me? Yes, and yes, but that's truly for you to decide. Did I love every part of his reply? <em>Absolutely</em>. Mild spoilers ahead by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): The game show element introduced in Chapter 3, hosted by Tenna, has his third round of the show abruptly cancelled. Did you ever have more fleshed out plans for that third round, or were you always planning to cancel it on the poor guy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> We made most of it, but cut it because it slowed down the pacing too much. To put it in words that fans will understand, "Your taking too long" + "the game's getting old."</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0e2e85b5b4ead/deltarune.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mr. Tenna, sir, you're hoggin' all the air time — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What drove you to make the [REDACTED] boss fight in Chapter 3 a seemingly impossible fight and how do you playtest something so difficult?</strong></p>
<p>You mean Elnina + Lanino? Yeah, there's actually a playtester that gave up at that point... Well, I didn't make it that hard on purpose. But, I did make it so that if you get a Game Over and you have no points and no healing items, you get 2 TV Dinners for free.</p>
<p>After using "ILoveTV" a couple times, it should be enough to beat the battle just by defending and healing, so keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>What sort of music brings you joy these days and what are a few musicians you find yourself listening to? Also, are you aware of the artist Porter Robinson? I feel like you two would make great pals and I'd selfishly love to see how you two could collaborate!</strong></p>
<p>I'm excited for the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_chiptune_band_anamanaguchi_shares_insight_into_its_latest_album_and_dream_smash_bros_fighters">anamanaguchi</a> album, "<a href="https://anamanaguchi.com/">Anyway</a>".</p>
<p>I heard <a href="https://porterrobinson.com/">Porter Robinson</a> before... that's right, the name of the music video was... "<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0">Shelter</a>" <em>(upon saying that word, his eyes glaze over, he steps back into the darkness and the door closes behind him...)</em></p>

<p><strong>How has it been developing for Switch 2 and have you had any thoughts of how you could take advantage of the unique hardware again down the road?</strong></p>
<p>It was kind of like the Nintendo Switch, but a much much bigger number, and strong. Down the road I'd like to take advantage of the unique hardware to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>I can't believe they misspelled "Bananaz" but I'll let it slide because they turned the rock into a girl. I wonder if she was originally intended to stay a rock, but then they realized that she didn't sing rock music, she sang girl music.</p>
<p><strong>How has it felt releasing your story in chunks/chapters like this, as opposed to a fully complete package and when are you personally hoping to have the final chapter of Deltarune release? Are we cursing you by even asking such a question?</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>I've never called them chunks. Maybe I should start calling them chunks? Like, here comes Chunk 5. I mean, that would be great if it was a game about cavemen, like Chuck Rock, or Bonk. That being said, I do feel like calling each episode a "Chapter" really undersells the fact that creating each one is like developing its own game. I've made the equivalent of like 2 and a half Undertales at this point. Continuously.</p>
<p>As for when it comes out, it should be out when it's done, which is as soon as it's finished, which, in my opinion, sooner would be better, but it takes a while. If it takes too long everybody is going to say " you're taking too long" and then I'll say "I'm old!" They'll have to revive me</p>

<p><em>Big thanks to Toby for taking the time away from his never ending development cycle to answer our questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Deltarune is now available on the eShop and currently includes Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4. You can also try the first two chapters for free by downloading the demo. All future chapters will be added to the paid package as and when they release</em></p>

<p>The official PR release has got all the deets you need, fellow dino-hunters!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nightdive Studios’ remastered Turok trilogy is renowned for modernizing the iconic games and bringing an epic saga to current-generation platforms. When it was first released in 1997, Turok introduced gamers to a world teeming with cunning enemies, traps, puzzles, and deadly weapons, all within a vast 3D environment ready to explore. All three of these classic games feature upgraded gameplay, high-resolution textures, enhanced lighting and rendering, and support for console gamepads with platform-specific features to sink your teeth into!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok</strong><br>
A world where time has no meaning and evil knows no bounds. Torn from a world long gone, the time-traveling warrior Turok has found himself thrust into an unknown land torn by conflict. An evil overlord known as 'The Campaigner' seeks to shred the fabric of time and rule the universe using an ancient artifact known as 'The Chronoscepter'. The Chronoscepter was shattered thousands of years ago in an effort to keep it from falling into evil hands. The Campaigner has constructed a massive focusing array which he plans to use to magnify and contain the power of the Chronoscepter to shatter the barriers between the ages and rule the universe. Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The Campaigner's evil plot...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</strong><br>
Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately, the blast awakens an even deadlier force — the Primagen. Once again, Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. The sequel to the hit game Turok features a host of enemies, weapons, missions, locations, and a new multiplayer mode.<br></em><em><strong><em><br>
Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em></strong></em><em><br>
In the third game in the classic trilogy, players choose between dual protagonists Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of <em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> protagonist Joshua Fireseed. Together, they must defeat the titular antagonist Oblivion and its followers, the Flesh Eaters, after the supposed demise of their brother at its hands.</em></p>
