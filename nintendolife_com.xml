<p>Rayman 2 has now been confirmed</p>

<figure data-uuid="6c1ec706e587e"><a title="Donkey Kong 64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c1ec706e587e/donkey-kong-64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this year, a Switch Online + Expansion Pack trailer supposedly teased some upcoming releases for the N64 library. One of these games was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a>, which was released in September, and another title spotted was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a>, and that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-n64-library-with-two-classic-platformers">now returning next week</a>.</p>
<p>So, what else might be on the way? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">In case you missed it</a>, or just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/latest-switch-online-release-potentially-confirms-leaked-upcoming-n64-classics">need another reminder</a>, three other titles seemingly identified in this video footage include Rare's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, the Nintendo beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros.</a> and the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a> release, which also got an eShop version earlier this year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytvEee42ub-Hw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Just remember that these three games haven't been officially announced or confirmed for the N64 digital library, so nothing here is necessarily guaranteed. Nintendo could also be saving certain titles for special occasions.</p>
<p>For now, N64 enthusiasts on Switch and Switch 2 can look forward to Rayman 2 and Ubisoft's other N64 outing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a>, which are both joining the service next week. In another surprise this week, Nintendo has added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wario_world">Wario World</a> to its GameCube library. You can find out more in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-expands-switch-2-gamecube-library-with-warios-3d-outing">our previous story</a>.</p>

<p>One launch game for the Switch 2 that didn't get a rosy reception was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>. This interactive exhibit allowed users to get up close with the new hybrid system and learn all about its fancy features and tech.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many fans were upset about Nintendo releasing this digital game as a paid title instead of a free bonus alongside the system. With this in mind, GameStop has now officially awarded this "interactive instruction booklet" with its "Worst Game of the Year" award. It managed to beat <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mindseye">MindsEye</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> and the all-time classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/superman_the_new_adventures">Superman 64</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bZE9oIFPXWw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbZE9oIFPXWw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZE9oIFPXWw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5bdf6fznrlox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>If you couldn't already tell, this whole awards show is actually a joke, and more of a publicity stunt than anything else (so try not to take it too seriously).</p>
<p>To truly highlight this, GameStop also awarded itself "The Game Store of the Year", and gave Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter epic <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_3">Halo 3</a> the 2025 "Game of the Year" – beating <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> and a bunch of other titles (<em>you can't argue with this one</em>).</p>

<p>On a <em>slightly</em> more serious note, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> won GameStop's "Best Nintendo Game of the Year". Oh, and the OG fire starter Charizard won the "best Pokémon Card of the Year" award.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, if you can look past the price, we think Welcome Tour is still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">a surprising, delightful and informative piece of software</a>, and gave it eight out of ten stars when it arrived on the Switch 2 in June. You can see our review for this and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong's latest outing</a> here on Nintendo Life.

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> got an update which added a "Year in Review" feature to the application. Nintendo has now officially made this available to Switch Online members.</p>

From here, you'll be able to see your total play time for the year, your most-played tracks, along with your most-played playlist and soundtrack of the year.</p>
<p>This Year in Review is available to view until <strong>5th January 2026</strong>, so check it out while it's available.</p>


<p>Apart from this, Nintendo has also added two new playlists including songs added to Nintendo Music in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, earlier this week Nintendo added the Switch soundtrack <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yoshis_crafted_world">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> to its music app.</p>

<p>An absolute Treasure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a> for the N64 'Nintendo Classics' library, Nintendo has today released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wario_world">Wario World</a> for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack GameCube service.</p>
<p>This game was developed by the talented Japanese team Treasure (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/gunstar_heroes">Gunstar Heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/sin_and_punishment">Sin and Punishment</a>), and was locally released on the GameCube in 2003. It's also Wario's first and only 3D platformer. Here's the official description about this "garlic-fueled rampage", courtesy of Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Go on a garlic-fueled rampage in this action title released for the Nintendo GameCube™ system in 2003! Wario's journey begins with a promise of vengeance against a powerful and cursed black jewel that's warped his castle and nabbed his treasure. Defeat enemies, collect coins and treasures, and rescue Spritelings trapped in boxes as you progress through four stages. Wario's got some mighty powerful moves, like Wild Swing-Ding and Piledriver, that aren't just good for attacking—they're also slick at clearing path-blocking traps."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan has received the same title this week. Below are some screenshots of the title from Nintendo's Japanese website.</p>
<p>Treasure has also acknowledged how six of its games <a href="https://x.com/TreasureCoLtd/status/1998963135424974885/photo/1">are now available on the Switch Online service</a>. Apart from Wario, Sin &amp; Punishment and Gunstar Heroes, the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis app also includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/dynamite_headdy">Dynamite Headdy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/light_crusader">Light Crusader</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/alien_soldier">Alien Soldier</a>.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the GameCube 'Nintendo Classics' service in June, Nintendo has added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>. These games joined <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also teased a bunch of upcoming titles for this library such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.</p>
