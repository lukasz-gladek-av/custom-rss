<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a> has received multiple updates since it launched earlier this year and alongside Update 1.3.0, Firaxis Games has now released the <strong>Tides of Power Collection</strong>.</p>
<p>This is "free to claim" on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop until <strong>5th January 2026</strong> and is "yours to keep permanently at no cost". After this date, you'll be required to purchase it.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown about what you can expect, along with an official graphic, and below this are the full details about the DLC (via the game's website patch notes):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Tides of Power Update:</strong> This is now fully claimable on Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch...Starting today, add Edward Teach, Republic of Pirates, and Tonga content packs to your game, and then receive the Sayyida al Hurra, Ottomans, and Iceland content packs in-game when they're released in December 2025. If you successfully claim this content by January 5, 2026 at 6:59AM PT, it's yours to keep; otherwise it will be available for individual purchase starting January 5, 2026."</p>

</nav>
<h2 id="tides-of-power-part-1-4th-november-2025">Tides of Power - Part 1 (4th November 2025)</h2>
<h2 id="leaders">Leaders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added new leader Edward Teach.</strong></p>
<p>Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate whose name sparked dread in the captains of the Caribbean. In 1716, he joined the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, a leader of the Flying Gang, and quickly gained his own ships. With his impressive height, his long beard (decorated with, at times, lit fuses), and reputation for violence, he stalked the sea-lanes of the Caribbean and the nightmares of sailors. He outlived the Flying Gang and moved his operation to the Outer Banks of present-day North Carolina, where a pirate hunter, Robert Maynard, finally caught up with him.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Militaristic, Economic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Blackbeard</strong>: All Naval Units gain the Pirate Ability, allowing them to cross borders of other civilizations, Plunder Trade Routes from non-Allied civilizations, and attack Naval Units of non-Allied civilizations without declaring war. Defeating any Naval Units with your own Naval Units provides Gold equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength and captures that Unit. Increased Gold maintenance costs for all Naval Units.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda – Queen Anne’s Revenge</strong>: Increase Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that build Naval Units. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that neglect to build Naval Units.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="civilizations">Civilizations</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Exploration Age civilization Republic of Pirates.</strong></p>
<p>Where there is wealth, there is greed. The scramble for new world riches in the early 18th century brought English, Spanish, French, and Dutch fleets – but the prospect of quick riches also brought pirates. These were rarely organized, but in 1706, one band, the Flying Gang, took over the island of New Providence in the Bahamas and set up a short-lived republic for all who sought fortune... and came with few scruples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Economic, Militaristic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Flying Gang</strong>: Increased Yields from Pillaging and Coastal Raiding with Naval Units. Settler Units cannot be trained or purchased, but you can capture other civilizations' Settlers. Naval Units, Treasure Convoys, and Buccaneer Units can move into other civilizations' borders without being at war or having Open Borders.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Buccaneer</strong>: Unique Commander Unit. Gains a set number of charges to use the 'Raiding Party' Action every set number of Promotions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Action - Raiding Party</strong>: Targets an adjacent Treasure Resource. This Settlement instantly spawns a Treasure Convoy under your control equal to the number of Treasure Resources; this does not reset until another Treasure Convoy is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Sloop</strong>: Unique Naval Unit (replaces Privateer). Can cross other civilizations' borders, Pillage Trade Routes between non-Allied civilizations, and attack Units of non-Allied civilizations without going to war. Can move after attacking and has a set amount of Movement.</li>
<li><strong>Associated Wonder – Havana Harbor</strong>: Gold Base. This Settlement generates Treasure Convoys worth a set amount of Treasure Fleet points in the Exploration Age (effect scales based on game speed). Increased Economic Attribute. Must be built in Distant Lands on Coastal Tiles adjacent to non-Lake tiles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Antiquity Age civilization Tonga.</strong></p>
<p>Into the endless blue, in search of new lands on scattered islands, the Polynesians sailed, settling the island of Tonga nearly three thousand years ago. Around 1000 CE, though, came another expansion, the Tu’i Tonga Empire – a struggle for dominance, tribute, and fealty over the Pacific. The Tongan kings maintained this system of hierarchical lordship over the islands until it, too, splintered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Expansionist, Diplomatic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Lords of the South</strong>: Increased Influence on City Halls and the Palace if adjacent to Coast tiles. Cannot incorporate City-States.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Tehina</strong>: Unique Scout Unit. Can enter Ocean tiles (without taking damage) and embark at the start of the Age. Cannot disembark in Distant Lands, but can use Coastal Raid on adjacent Discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Kalia</strong>: Increased Combat Strength against Districts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wonders">Wonders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added four new Wonders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great Lighthouse – Antiquity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold Base. Grants a free Merchant when built. +15 Water Trade Route Range in all Settlements. +1 Sight to all Naval Units. Must be built on a Coast tile adjacent to Land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nan Madol – Exploration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provides +3 Culture, +3 Production, and +3 Happiness on the Palace and City Hall on Islands (a landmass with a maximum of 15 tiles). Must be built in an Island City on Coast adjacent to Land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Great Blue Hole – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Science and +4 Happiness. Adjacent sea rural tiles receive +2 Culture. Placed on the Coast adjacent to 6 coast tiles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mapu'a Vaea Blowholes – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Production and +4 Happiness. +2 Culture to all Coastal land tiles in this Settlement. Impassable.</li>
<li>Placed on the Coast adjacent to Cliffs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<p>Firaxis has also included some platform-specific updates tied to the Switch and Switch 2 in Update 1.3.0. This includes the following:</p>
<p><strong>Switch / Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR options now appear when undocking Switch.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where the last character entered with the virtual keyboard would appear incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>You can find out more about Update 1.3.0 and what else it includes in the official update notes on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">official Civilization website</a>.</p>

<p>In the absence of a major Animal Crossing announcement, this week felt a little quieter than last, but there was still plenty to get excited about. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC scored a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-legends-z-as-mega-dimension-dlc-scores-december-release-date">December release date</a>, and we got a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-mystery-gift-code-event-has-been-announced">Mystery Gift event</a> in the process.

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867,193521 @ 1762606121 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> at the moment, so I’ve gone back to the old favourites: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, and yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>. Considering the appearance of Alyssa Ashcroft in the upcoming title, I’d love for Capcom to provide a legitimate way to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a> on modern consoles, but alas, I don’t think it’s happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>We’ve also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami 2</a> on the horizon, so I’ve gone back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> for a little bit. Truth be told, alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, this might actually be my favourite launch game for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm in the fun little position of being <em>between games</em> after wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> earlier this week, and not wanting to splash out on anything else 'AAA' until Metroid comes a-calling. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> is still eating up my every free moment (obviously), but maybe now it my chance to sneak in something smaller before the year's up. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> has been looking at me from my wishlist for a while now, so perhaps it's finally time to dive in.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I just remembered that I've had <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> on pause while I put Pokémon in the rear-view mirror. <em>That's</em> the weekend's plan sorted, then.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm hoping to polish off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> this weekend. I've found myself playing/watching a little bit every morning over breakfast, as if I were channel-hopping before school as a kid. It's a cracking little piece of software - look out for a review sometime soon-ish.</p>
<p>Beyond that (and keeping with the early '90s theme), I found myself redownloading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> just to get a look at the Simpsons stuff. After dying twice in a row extremely early doors, I enabled gyro and made it to #2 on the third jump from the bus. First loser! It's a weird thing, Fortnite these days, but I did enjoy most of those 20 minutes. Maybe I'll dip back into that.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> proves that every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow, just like in real life. While there has been zero progress since last weekend (except, of course, making Melinöe stronger with each demise), I hope to turn the tables this weekend. Lots of high adrenaline arcade action as well, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-tokyo-wars">Arcade Archives 2: Tokyo Wars</a>' bare-bones single player experience quickly turns into a frenetic split-screen multiplayer extravaganza (I miss Wii U’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tank_tank_tank">Tank! Tank! Tank!</a> …) and both Toaplan’s Arcade Collection volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 50 of 50 games played! The final five titles are all absolute stunners! 'Combatants' (clever pun!) is all bout real-time tactics with fighting ants, 'Quibble Race' finally made me understand Japanese obsession with horse racing simulations, 'Seaside Drive' is purest shmup bliss, 'Campanella 3' is the final game in the series and goes full <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> and to wrap up this package the multi-genre, 'Cyber Owls', which I hope to complete this weekend. What an incredible package, part of me wants 'Super UFO 50' to happen, with SNES-style graphics and music… one can dream!</p>
<p>My game of the week is Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Being a huge fan of this spin-off series and the added hardware strength of the Switch 2, I see nothing but a very good time ahead. Are you a person who finds the whole Musou gameplay strangely soothing and great stress relief? Just me?</p>

<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>I’ve got to admit, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has hooked me far more than I expected it would. The criticism about the sameness of the environments and the rather wooden NPCs is completely fair, but I still find it hard to put down. I particularly enjoy hunting for Alpha Pokémon and having an oversized critter following me around. The battle system feels fresh and fluid — and occasionally challenging, which makes for a nice change. I was genuinely taken aback by how good the Mega Dimensions DLC looks. It really seems to cater to high-level play, though I’m not exactly thrilled about the price point.</p>
<p>I’m also completely addicted to BALL x PIT. It gets me into that flow state I love, scratches the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> itch, and does something new and mechanically interesting that you don’t often see in other Survivors-likes. It’s such a fresh and satisfying gameplay loop.</p>
<p>I’ve also been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi’s Mansion</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. I missed it back in the day, but I can definitely see what people mean about the spooky atmosphere of this first entry compared with the next two in the series. The original just nails that haunted house vibe a bit better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, which is objectively a better game in almost every respect.</p>

<p>"Expect this patch to go live within the next two weeks with more details of the next patch being shared closer to its release. So stay tuned and once again, thanks for your support, feedback, and patience! Now let’s get back on the lawn and listen to those sweet tunes!"</p>

<p>Power up next week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> launches for the Switch and Switch 2 next week, and in case you missed it, players who purchase the Switch release will be able to update their game to play an "enhanced version" on the Switch 2 system.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco explains on its website (and in the video above) how you'll be able to do this by simply connecting your Switch 2 system to the internet and then downloading the update. After this, the characters and backgrounds in the game will appear with "improved clarity and richer detail".</p>
<p>When applying this update, certain save data - including battle replay data, edit data and online records cannot be carried over. As for battles, you'll be able to play with users on Switch 2 and other Switch players who have this same update applied.</p>
<p>Below is a look at the Switch version before the update, after the update, and how the game looks on Switch 2:</p>
