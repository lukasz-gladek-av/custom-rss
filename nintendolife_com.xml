<p>Gotta count 'em all</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Pokémon officially turns 30 tomorrow, but with Japan already ticking over into 27th Feb, The Pokémon Company has released a special video to celebrate the series' big birthday.</p>
<p>The vid is all about those new 30th anniversary icons that you may have spotted online in recent weeks. TPC has designed one for each Pokémon — yep, all 1,025 of them — and a select few get put in the spotlight above, accompanied by an adorable little animation.</p>
<p>It's mainly the series starters and legendaries that are highlighted in this one, but the final zoom-out throws a bunch more into the mix — if your eyes can keep up. If you want to catch 'em all up close, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/30th_logo/">official Japanese Pokémon site</a>, where each of them is laid out in Pokédex order.</p>
<p>The logos have been distributed as part of a social media campaign by <a href="https://x.com/poke_times" tabindex="-1">@poke_times</a> on <a href="https://x.com/poke_times/status/2025782669104349237">X</a>, with all those who retweet being assigned a random icon. They have also been cropping up on large billboards in popular Japanese locations, like Shinjuku Station in Tokyo and Namba Station in Osaka.</p>
<p>We have to admit, it's a really cute way to celebrate the 30th anniversary. Here's hoping that TPC can keep the good times going in tomorrow's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-february-2026-time-date-how-to-watch">Pokémon Presents</a>.</p>
