<p>15 years leads to big(Ben) payout</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2beae5d594c4c"><a title="Wii and Wii Remote" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2beae5d594c4c/wii-and-wii-remote.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been locked in a long-running legal battle with BigBen Interactive — now known as Nacon — over an infringement relating to the patent of the Wii controller for a full 15 years. That's a long time!</p>
<p>Now, though, and as reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/">The Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-wins-8m-in-15-year-old-lawsuit-over-wii-controller-patent">Games Industry.biz</a>), the Japanese giant has finally had success, resulting in a <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">"nearly EUR 7 million"</a> payout ($8.2million).</p>
<p>The judgment in the case, which was reached in October and concerns BigBen's third-party Wiimotes, took a remarkably long time, especially given that the court originally found BigBen guilty of patent infringement <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-before-the-mannheim-district-court">back in 2011</a>. The ruling does give Nacon the right to appeal, and that is something they are currently doing, having "delayed the proceedings several times, for example by rejecting the court-appointed expert", according to <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">the press release</a> put out by Nintendo's German legal team.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The same press release highlights how the case is unusual due to Nintendo's damages calculations being made under a "lost profits theory":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Particularly significant: the court assumed that Nintendo would have made 100% of the sales made by BigBen, without any deductions in view of third-party suppliers that were active in the market. BigBen had argued that buyers, had they not bought the BigBen products, would have opted for other third-party controllers that were available. However, the court found that these third-party products were also highly likely to infringe the patent-in-suit. Citing case law from the German Federal Court of Justice, it stated that hypothetical mitigating circumstances that would have amounted to third-party activities that also trigger damages could not be taken into account in favor of the infringer."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This case is also of particular note as it's been so long-running that the actual damages have increased by €3 million due to interest rates 5% higher than central bank rates. "These delaying tactics have now proved costly," say Nintendo's lawyers. <em>Ouch.</em></p>
<p>Nacon is appealing, but right now this is looking like a significant legal win for Nintendo.</p>

<p>Square Enix must be pix-elated</p>

<figure data-uuid="2a6ba6d9a44ee"><a title="FF6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a6ba6d9a44ee/ff6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a> series has sold over 6 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>Although initially receiving a staggered release between 2021 and 2022 on Windows, iOS, and Android, the series arguably saw a huge boost when it made its way to the Switch and PS4 in 2023, with a release on Xbox following in 2024.</p>
<p>Consisting of the first six games in the series, the total sales does, in theory, average out at around 1 million per game, but in reality, it's likely that sales have skewed heavily in favour of more popular entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_iv">Final Fantasy IV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Regardless, it's an impressive result.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ka7wISlvfFw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKa7wISlvfFw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31cf84lhoiqk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Square Enix last confirmed in March 2025 that the series had sold a total of 5 million copies, which means it's managed an extra 1 million in the months following.</p>
<p>We imagine Square Enix must be pretty thrilled with the sales so far, but then the company has garnered a rather unfortunate reputation for being constantly disappointed in its games' performance, so who knows.</p>
<p>We'll be seeing more Final Fantasy on the Switch 2 when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. A demo showcasing the beginning of the game is now available for download from the eShop.</p>
