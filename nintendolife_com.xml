It's the weekend once again, but before we dive into what we're playing, let's just do a quick recap of the last week.</p>
<p>First up, it seems only right that we go over some of the reviews we posted this week, because these include some pretty big games:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><br>

<p>Onto the news, and the bigg'un this week is the confirmation that Nintendo of America's President, Doug Bowser, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement">will be retiring at the end of the year</a>. Devon Pritchard will be taking over the role, while Satoru Shibata will join NoA as its CEO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> was announced for the Switch 2 and will include a brand new tale, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> confirmed an awesome <strong>Mega Man</strong> collaboration for its upcoming DLC.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, which was originally due to launch in early October, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">has been delayed to an unspecified date</a>. Not hugely surprising, and to be honest, there's so much coming out in the coming weeks, we'll be happy to wait for this one.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This week I finally finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, by which I mean I rolled credits after almost 30 hours with a 74% completion rate. I've since gone back, collected some more masks and grubs, and killed a couple of optional bosses bringing me up to 81%. I should really step away now - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> isn't going to play itself, and I've run out of things to spend Geo on. BUT! Beating the final trial in the Colosseum of Fools will get me another Pale Ore (I think?), and then I can upgrade my nail one more time, which would be neat. Can I resist seeing that percentage counter go up to 100 112?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I did start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which feels very Ubisoft, but not bad - I'm looking forward to playing more. However, payday arrived and I immediately ticked off one of my wishlist; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a> is now on my Switch 2. Despite lacking official S2 compatibility, I'm going to try it there and switch back to my OLED if I hit problems. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> this weekend and see if that resolution update has actually made a substantial difference. It really is a remarkable game, but man, does it look rough on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is also on the cards, and I'd also like to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst: Deluxe</a> if I can find the time. Oh, and I've also picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> on the PS5, so that'll be a pretty high priority for me.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I think I’m closing in on the first end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> and that’s good news. Not that I want it to end, I should stress, but my backlog from September alone is already looking at me with a hard stare, and I don’t want to picture what it’ll look like after <em>all the games</em> come out in October.</p>
<p>Between Silksong sessions, I’ve been plugging away at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> (also very, very good), and I recently picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> which, I hate to admit, I’ve never actually played. Oh yes, and I have Hades 2 locked and loaded for when I find a minute in-between all that.</p>
<p>So, a nice quiet one then!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Home stretch on Shinobi: Art of Vengeance with every level beckoning an endurance battle of skill, patience and some degree of sheer luck... a regular day for a ninja then. Being a complete sucker for mechs and SRPGS, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> and so far its a blast. It certainly was a long wait but Hades 2 is finally out of early access and a timed exclusive on Switch hardware. I’m a bit rusty but Melinoë certainly stands tall to Zagreus. I was not disciplined enough to have waited till November to pick up the physical edition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 19 of 50 games played. Golfaria is quite something!</p>
<p>Game of the week is (still) Star Wars Outlaws. With Kijimi complete, time to head for Akiva on the prowl for a droidsmith. I’m leaving Tatooine for last, looking forward to that.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm sticking with Hades 2 for the foreseeable future, mostly because I want to see <em>everything</em> this game has for me post-credits, but I also want to start afresh and run through the game proper. What a game. Supergiant is far too good to us.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm still fighting the urge to start a fresh save in Silksong. Thankfully we're away this weekend, so I don't think I'll be caving into my vices yet. Enjoy the weekend! Spooky season approaches!</p>

<p>There's a lot of new game footage on display at Tokyo Game Show this week, and on top of all the Square Enix game trailers, the company has now shared another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a>.</p>
<p>This game was announced earlier this month and will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 on 5th February 2026.</p>
<p>Now, at Japan's big gaming event, Square Enix has premiered roughly 17 minutes of live gameplay footage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@squareenix/streams">during its stage event</a>. The gameplay is featured between 27:43 - 44:39 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-17-minutes-of-tgs-2025-gameplay">thanks, Gematsu</a>), and while it's all in Japanese, there's still enough footage on display to get an idea of what you can expect.</p>

<p>If you didn't catch the news earlier this month, Square Enix has also confirmed there's no upgrade path available or planned for the Switch version. So you'll need to buy the title on Switch 2 if you want to play it on this system. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> (due out next month) also got a trailer yesterday showing off the new underwater region.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Square Enix has also shared roughly 18 minutes of gameplay footage of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> during the same stage event. This title is arriving for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025. You can see the gameplay on display between the 40:00 - 58:10 mark in the video below:</p>

<p>Game-Key Card release also confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega this week surprised Yakuza fans with the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It will be making its way to Nintendo's new hybrid system early next year on 12th February 2026, and while we've already got a teaser of what to expect, the team at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has now shared a "first look" at the combat gameplay in Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>
<p>In case you missed the announcement, this "evolved edition" is based on Kazuma Kiryu's original PlayStation 3 title, which was released in 2009. And Dark Ties is a brand-new tale starring Yoshitaka Mine (Kiryu's adversary). This package promises to bring not only intense battles but also added cutscenes and reimagines the original outing with cutting-edge visuals.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:188290 @ 1758968180 -->
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties will launch for Switch 2 on 12th February 2026 and will be available as a digital and physical release, with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirming it's a game-key card release. Before this, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> are coming to the Switch 2 this November. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-announced-for-switch-2-launching-in-february-2026">previously confirmed</a>, these games are also getting game-key card releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> didn't get off to the best start when it arrived on the Switch 2 in June, but IO Interactive has made an effort since then to improve the overall experience.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the developer has now released <em>another</em> game update, which makes some updates across all platforms and also resolves multiple bugs in the Switch 2 version of the game. This follows an update in August, which added a Frame Rate option to lock the game at 30fps.</p>
<p>The latest update has also been made available alongside the new elusive target mission, featuring Bruce Lee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bruce Lee enters HITMAN World of Assassination as the next Celebrity Elusive target, but this time with a twist. Together with 47, Agent Lee takes his legendary martial arts skills undercover to infiltrate the Concord Union and take them down from the inside."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the patch notes for this latest update, bumping the title up to Version 3.240 (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-3-240-update-out-now-patch-notes-includes-nintendo-switch-2-fixes/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>

</nav>
<h2 id="hitman-world-of-assassination-version-3-240">Hitman World of Assassination - Version 3.240</h2>
<h3 id="new-features"><strong>New Features</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Two-Handed Tweaks</strong><br>
Aiming of two-handed weapons has been improved; it is now based on the position of both hands. Previously, it was based on the main hand, adjusted slightly with the support hand.</p>
<p>Collision of weapons when wielded with both hands has also been improved; it is now based around the barrel of the weapon. This should help to prevent drifting when holding a sniper above railings.</p>
<p><strong>Bullet in the Chamber</strong><br>
Last patch, we added tactical reloading, where reloading a non-empty magazine didn’t require you to rack the slide. We have since iterated upon this and the chambered bullet is now visible when racking the slide.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpened Scope</strong><br>
We’ve made some improvements to cases where far away objects could become invisible when looking through a sniper scope, causing great difficulty when sniping from certain vantage points.</p>
<p><strong>Savor the Moment</strong><br>
Various key moments and kill opportunities are now in third person, allowing you to take pride in your work.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive Interactions</strong><br>
We have made various improvements to touch interactions, including adding hand poses when your hand comes into proximity with them.</p>
<p><strong>Screw the Big Screen</strong><br>
We’ve moved some starting and exit cutscenes into 3D instead of using the 2D “cinema mode” screen.</p>
<p><strong>Pistol Placement</strong><br>
When starting a mission, concealed weapons (e.g. pistols) are no longer stored in a hip holster. Instead, they are placed in the inventory wheel.</p>
<p><strong>Firm Grip</strong><br>
We’ve improved the alignment of various items when they’re held.</p>
<p><strong>Holster Feedback</strong><br>
We’ve changed how the feedback works for holsters.</p>
<p><strong>Options Bonanza</strong><br>
We’ve added various options allowing you to refine your experience so that it’s just right.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two-Handed Aiming</strong>
<ul>
<li>Controls how weapons are aimed when wielding them with both hands. The default is the new positional aiming mode, but this can be changed to the previous behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Firearm Angle</strong>
<ul>
<li>Last patch, we added an option allowing you to change the angle of a held firearm. We’ve now split this into two options for one-handed and two-handed weapons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Toggle Grip</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enabling this allows you to release the grip button while keeping items in your hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All platforms</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultimate Warrior</strong><br>
We’ve added the ability for you to holster two items on your back. Currently, this is restricted to Katanas and the new Kali Sticks from The Bruce Lee Pack, but we are evaluating more items that may benefit from this feature.</p>
<p><strong>Safehouse Shuffle</strong><br>
We’ve added a new gear wall in the Safehouse basement. It is currently used to house items from “The Banker Pack” and “The Bruce Lee Pack” DLCs.</p>
<p><strong>Spooky Safehouse</strong><br>
With Halloween on the horizon, we’ve added some themed cosmetics to the Safehouse. These are available to use now so you can ensure your bones are sufficiently rattled for the big day.</p>
<p><strong>Undercover Antics</strong><br>
We’ve enabled the following disguised entrances in “The Banker” and “The Monarchique”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undercover in the Kitchen (Palace Staff)</li>
<li>Undercover in the Locker Room (Chef)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Store Remodel</strong><br>
The in-game store page has been divided into separate categories to give a clearer overview of what each DLC grants.</p>
<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>
<p><em>As always, many of the fixes below were resolved thanks to reports made by the community. We extend our deepest gratitude to everyone who continues to report issues they run into – stay vigilant!</em></p>
<p><strong>Level Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breaking and Entering</strong><br>
Resolved an exploit in the Safehouse where the bedroom could be accessed via the bathroom before the required mastery level was reached.</p>
<p><strong>Folded Out of Life</strong><br>
Resolved various situations in The Banker where Le Chiffre could suspend his routine.</p>
<p><strong>Follow No More</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where the steps could get stuck on “Follow the Guard”.</p>
<p><strong>Fruitless Escape</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Banker where Le Chiffre slipping on a banana peel could trigger the helicopter escape cutscene and cause mission failure.</p>
<p><strong>Leaving a Message, Are We?</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Banker where Le Chiffre would talk with General Murillo on the phone, even if he was otherwise indisposed.</p>
<p><strong>No More Stalling</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in The Banker where using some interactions while poisoned stopped 47 from being properly relocated when the timer ran out.</p>
<p><strong>Sore Loser</strong><br>
Le Chiffre will now flee when on high alert or when the VIP Room chandelier is broken. This resolves an issue where the poker game could “continue” despite the broken chandelier rendering the table unusable.</p>
<p><strong>The House Always Wins</strong><br>
Resolved an exploit in The Banker that let players distract the cashier while being handed chips, causing them to be duplicated indefinitely. The casino’s ledgers are balanced again.</p>
<p><strong>Tricky Trespassing</strong><br>
Fixed inconsistent trespassing zones the lounge found in The Banker where the zone extended past the intended barrier posts. We’ve also fixed staff disguises being regarded as hostile in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>Counter-Intuitive</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in Sapienza where breaking the glass on the display case and walking on a bag of potatoes in the butcher shop allowed Agent 47 to walk on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>No More Vanishing Acts</strong><br>
Resolved a small spot in Sapienza where objects could fall through the floor when thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Nothing</strong><br>
Eliminated an invisible obstacle in Sapienza. Even the legendary Agent 47 can’t blend into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>When Hitmen Fly</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in Sapienza that caused 47 to fall when climbing through a specific window in the Town Hall, above Bravuomo’s office.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Map</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where the camera could go out-of-world near the tunnel to the Coca Fields in Santa Fortuna.</p>
<p><strong>Boxed In</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in Mumbai where subduing the guard leaning on a wooden crate in the Construction Site caused Agent 47 to clip into it.</p>
<p><strong>Clean Drop</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in Whittleton Creek where dumping a body over the railing in the garden of certain houses gave two conflicting prompts that could lead to incorrect animations.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Disposal</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in Haven Island where Agent 47 could get stuck when dumping a body into the water near the villa’s main entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Laser Reactivation</strong><br>
Fixed a bug in Berlin where taking items from the briefcase caused the laser tripwires placed on the Radio Tower to turn back on after being disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Unseen, but Not Unbreakable</strong><br>
Removed some invisible collision in Chongqing found in The Block</p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT ART</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unbuttered Blades</strong><br>
Fixed a bug that left a knife lodged in a toaster in an apartment in Sapienza. 47 prefers his tools sharp, not toasted.</p>
<p><strong>Knock, Knock</strong><br>
Corrected the issue in Santa Fortuna where using gate knocker at Rico’s compound while an NPC opens the door causes it to start floating.</p>
<p><strong>No More Surprise Cactus</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in Whittleton Creek where a cactus would suddenly appear inside another plant in Helen’s room.</p>
<p><strong>Telepathic Construction</strong><br>
Resolved an issue in Chongqing where the crane near The Block was not properly aligned with the ground.</p>
<p><strong>CHARACTER ART</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fool’s Gold</strong><br>
Fixed the waistcoat of The Devil’s Own so it is the proper golden color instead of white.</p>
<p><strong>A Perfect Fit</strong><br>
Corrected the visual issue with Murillo’s security guard disguise, where the loose jacket created the illusion of a bulkier Agent 47.</p>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case Closed</strong><br>

<h3 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h3>
<p>Below is a list of known issues that have been identified by the team who are working on fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When travelling to specific locations within Freelancer (currently we’ve only identified a certain spawn in Berlin as having this issue) with a large illegal item, it’s possible for the briefcase to spawn incorrectly, causing it and the item inside to be lost or otherwise inaccessible.
<ul>
<li>We’ve found that repeatedly pausing and unpausing the game for the first few seconds of the intro cutscene can prevent this issue from occurring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In “The Infiltrator” and “The Dragon”, when Bruce Lee is fighting, it’s possible for the fighters to get stuck under specific circumstances, blocking progression of the mission.</li>
