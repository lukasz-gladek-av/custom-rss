<p>Blames Star Wars for poor performance thus far...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot, has been answering questions during a recent general meeting about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has struggled thus far to live up to expectations, with rather poor sales figures overall.</p>
<p>Now, ask this writer and he'll tell you that Star Wars Outlaws is a genuinely cracking game, really and truly, and we're all very excited for its Switch 2 release here at Nintendo Life. Indeed, it's likely to prove the console's first 'impossible port' of sorts, especially if it manages to arrive in a decent state, so interest is high in this one, for sure, even for non-SW fans.</p>
<p>With regards to the game's current sales issues, and as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-blames-star-wars-outlaws-missed-sales-targets-on-star-wars-itself-being-in-choppy-waters-but-hopes-further-improvements-and-a-switch-2-launch-can-revive-the-open-world-game/">GamesRadar</a>, Guillemot says that he sees Star Wars itself as part of the problem, with fans perhaps feeling done in with constant TV shows which, in 2024 when the game was released, had sort of run out of steam a little. Yes, we didn't like The Acolyte either, Yves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game suffered from a number of items. First, it suffered from the fact that it was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters, said Guillemot, whilst also acknowledging that the game wasn't quite perfect at any rate, "The game had a few items that still needed to be polished...they were polished and debugged in the early weeks after release, but it did affect sales volumes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily for Switch 2 fans, then, it also seems that the version we'll get our hands on come September 4th will arrive with some added improvements, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We did heavily improve the game by troubleshooting and debugging. When it will be released on upcoming consoles such as the Switch 2 it will have a new version of the game. Improvements on the game are not finished."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Now, that's what I call a backlog</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="clair obscur actor Mario 64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb2cd6f669cba/clair-obscur-actor-mario-64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sandfall Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is one of those games that, even though it isn't available on any Nintendo consoles - well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-seems-open-to-a-switch-2-port">not yet anyway</a> - we've all likely heard plenty about it thanks to just how widely-acclaimed it's been since launch earlier in the year. And rightly so!</p>
<p>Indeed, this very writer gave the dazzling RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-seems-open-to-a-switch-2-port">a rather nice 10/10</a> over on our sister site Pure Xbox, so yeah, it's a proper all-timer. And therefore, it may come as something of a surprise to learn that Charlie Cox, who plays Gustave in Sandfall Interactive's epic, reckons he hasn't played a video game since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>...which is ages ago.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-charlie-cox-vows-to-finally-play-the-game-his-first-since-super-mario-64">as reported by Eurogamer</a>, Cox, who spent just four hours recording his lines for the game, and says he feels like a "fraud" as a result, has been chatting during a Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon over in New Orleans, as you can see from the following clip from the chat that's been shared on social media.</p>

<p>The British actor, who was most widely known for his roles in Daredevil and Stardust before his newfound Clair Obscur fame, said that <em>"I remember being in the studio and thinking, 'this is beautiful, the visuals are extraordinary...They've come a long way since Mario 64, which is probably the last computer game I played."</em></p>
<p>Now he's promising to pick up an actual console and play the game that's thrust him into the spotlight as a bonafide video game star, <em>"I wanna play the game,"</em> he remarked, <em>"I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game."</em></p>
<p>Maybe, once he's eased back into the pastime with some of his own game, he'll be ready to return to the likes of Mario, who, we think it's fair to say, has changed a little bit since the last time Mr Cox had a blast.</p>

<p>Don't be shy, come closer...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We rewarded Migami Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/chronicles_of_the_wolf">Chronicles of the Wolf</a> a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/chronicles-of-the-wolf">super solid 7/10</a> when it launched just a few weeks ago, saying that, <em>"if you've got the patience to revisit a time when games were slower and more cryptic, and the pacing was a little more intense, Chronicles of the Wolf is like a rich, dark relic that you’ll treasure."</em></p>
<p>For those who're attracted by such a challenge, well, good news! Migami Games has just an announced that their metroidvania is now fully compatible with Switch 2 consoles. Hooray!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The time has now come for you to fulfil your destiny on Nintendo Switch 2. The wait is over, you can now enjoy Mateo’s haunting journey through Gévaudan with improved performance and compatibility on Nintendo’s latest hardware. Whether you’re hunting the Beast for the first time or returning to finish the fight, the experience has never looked or played better on Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With over 100 unique enemies, and a fairly lush gothic vibe about it all, Chronicles of the Wolf has certainly been doing quite well with audiences across the internet, and may not be a bad shout for a fresh new metroidvania challenge to break in your fresh new Switch 2 console!</p>
<p>In terms of upgrades or special features for Switch 2, there is no word of anything of note, so it seems that performance fixes - and there were a few technical issues on switch 1 - will be the highlight here. Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a> should take note, by the way, that not only is the voice of Alucard himself involved here (yes, that's Robert Belgrade on narration duties), there's also a special guest appearance from a Bloodstained character. Lots of crossover fun, it seems!</p>

<figure><a title="Ori Dev" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d537c5efe285d/ori-dev.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Moon Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-22T03:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 22nd Jul 2025, 4:30am</time>]:</strong> As highlighted by our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-skip-xbox-for-the-time-being-due-to-current-market-conditions">Pure Xbox</a>, Moon Studio CEO Thomas Mahler has provided an update today about <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-skip-xbox-for-the-time-being-due-to-current-market-conditions">No Rest for the Wicked</a></strong> coming to other platforms.</p>
<p>Although it seems the Xbox version might be ruled out in the immediate future, a Switch 2 version is still "potentially" on the cards despite the "current market conditions". Mahler <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874">reportedly confirmed this on Discord</a> (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/44658-ori-devs-gauging-interest-in-bringing-no-rest-for-the-wicked-to-switch-2-update">via GoNintendo</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Given current market conditions, we might only release on PS5 and potentially Switch 2 for the time being - we'll have to discuss things with MS to see what makes sense for Xbox."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493">separate thread on social media</a>, Mahler also noted how the team would ultimately ship on all platforms, but "likely not at the same time". Keep in mind, nothing has been "officially" confirmed at this stage.</p>

<p>If we hear any other updates or a proper announcement for Switch 2, we'll let you know. You can find out more about this game in the original story below.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-rumours-leaks-announcement-history">formally announced the Switch 2 last week</a> and while some developers appear to have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-ubisoft-has-more-than-half-a-dozen-games-planned-for-switch-2">already locked in their support</a>, other studios are still gauging whether or not to release certain titles on the Switch's successor.</p>
<p>One of these developers happens to be Moon Studios, with the CEO Thomas Mahler asking on social media if fans of the studio (as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ori_and_the_blind_forest_definitive_edition">Ori</a> games and Nintendo platforms) would be interested in the team's new release, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/no_rest_for_the_wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></strong> on Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard about this game, it was released in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/">early access on Steam last April</a>, has "mostly positive" user reviews, and is described as a "visceral precision Action RPG" aiming to reinvent the genre. Here's the story and you can check out the trailer below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year is 841 – King Harol is dead. As word of his death echoes throughout the kingdom, the crown passes to his arrogant, yet untested son Magnus.</p>
<p>Even worse, the Pestilence, an unholy plague not seen for a thousand years, has returned. It sweeps across the land, corrupting everything and everyone it touches. Madrigal Seline, a ruthlessly ambitious figure in the church, sees the Pestilence as a chance to prove herself in the eyes of her god.</p>
<p>These forces converge on the backwater Isola Sacra, where rebel groups and the provincial government fight for control amid the isle’s crumbling ruins.</p>
<p>You are a Cerim – a member of a group of mystical holy warriors imbued with remarkable powers and sworn to defeat the Pestilence at any cost. But the task will prove increasingly challenging as you become entangled in the people’s plight and the vast political struggle of this downtrodden land. Chaos will pull you in every direction as you seek to cleanse the land of wickedness and shape the kingdom’s fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this might seem like an obvious "yes, you should do it" following the sales success of the Switch, development has become increasingly costly (and timely) in recent years with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/10/concord-cost-sony-over-usd200-million-and-didnt-make-a-single-cent">failures resulting in studio shutdowns</a>, so it doesn't necessarily hurt to gauge markets before committing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/the-switch-eshop-is-a-nightmare-so-weve-made-our-own-better-eshop">eShop is also more crowded than ever</a>, making it tough - even for prominent third-party and indie games to stand out.</p>

<p>Paul Castro Jr., perhaps best known to Switch fans as the voice of Rindo in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/neo_the_world_ends_with_you">NEO: The World Ends With You</a>, plays <em>all</em> of the Toads you see throughout the world. Not the main Toad we know, though — that reveal <a href="https://x.com/PaulCastroJr/status/1947529413555347620">will come later</a>.</p>
<p>"I can finally share who I voice in MARIO KART WORLD<em>...</em> TOAD!(s)" Castro Jr. shared on social media. "Can't thank Nintendo enough for letting me live out this childhood dream."</p>

<p>The playable Toad was previously voiced by the same actor as Peach, so we'll have to see who has taken over at a later date.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p><figure><a title="Princess Peach - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c82f943f7c8a/princess-peach-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last month, alongside the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, Princess Peach's voice actor Samantha Kelly revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/princess-peachs-voice-actor-has-been-replaced-after-18-years">she was no longer voicing this iconic video game character</a> after 18 years.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, it's been confirmed that the new voice of Princess Peach (and Baby Peach) is Courtney Lin.</p>
<p>Lin confirmed this in an <a href="https://x.com/thecourtneylin/status/1947399822946013624">announcement on her social media</a>. She also acknowledged how she has "so much respect" for the previous Peach voice actors and said she will do her best with "every opportunity".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Courtney Lin</strong>: I can finally say… I’m the voice of Princess Peach and Baby Peach in Mario Kart World! Eternally grateful for Nintendo, for trusting me to help carry the legacy of this icon.</p>
<p>These characters are so much bigger than ourselves. I am so honored and honestly can still hardly believe it. I have so much respect for all of the Peaches that came before me, especially the one I grew up with</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>…I will do my best with every opportunity I am given, and I hope you all have been enjoying the game . Wahooo!! Sweet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Lin's <a href="https://www.thecourtneylin.com/voiceover">official website</a>, she has previously voiced characters in series like Monster High, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Pokémon (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Pokémon Masters EX</a>).</p>
<p>Lin's name was previously spotted last month in the credits of Mario Kart World <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/marios-voice-actor-says-its-unbelievable-to-hear-his-voice-in-mario-kart-world">alongside Kevin Afghani (the voice of Mario)</a>, when the game was released on 5th June.</p>

<p>Once again, this confirmation follows Samatha Kelly's update, which revealed how she found out her time as Peach was "over" as the Switch 2, and the latest Mario Kart game, was releasing.</p>
<p>This voice actor swap for Princess Peach follows some recent updates about the voice actors playing Donkey Kong and Pauline in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Monument Valley III Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157466/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>There's something nostalgic about going back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley">Monument Valley</a>. Ustwo's indie hit debuted on mobile in 2014 and helped establish (at least for a mainstream audience) that the mobile space could include the artistry of the wider indie games scene with thoughtful, immaculately presented, perspective-bending puzzlers alongside all the clickers and tappers and match-threes. The striking presentation and Escher-style designs put it squarely in the 'games as art' category. And though short, it was sweet enough to linger long after you'd finished. I remember having a wonderful time with it on iOS.</p>
<p>Two sequels eventually came, and now they're all on PC and consoles. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_1and2_bundle">1 and 2</a>, available separately or as a bundle, are joined by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley III</a>, previously a Netflix Games exclusive since its December '24 mobile launch. These console versions expand the canvas to 16:9 and adapt the controls for a gamepad. And it works, just. It's a shame, though, to see the impeccable presentation let down a little by some odd choices and a glitch or two at launch.</p>

<p>For Monument Valley newbies, you're presented with discreet screens featuring surreal architecture floating in a dreamy landscape and tasked with guiding your character — in this case, Noor — around the blocky structures to buttons, doorways, and eventually the exit. You don't control Noor directly; rather, you tap — or in this case scooch your cursor along the path and click (more on this later) — where you want her to walk, after which she'll make her way there, if the route is clear.</p>
<p>Movable platforms, dials, and other interactable elements enable you to change the twisting terrain in a perspective-breaking fashion which makes sense from an isometric viewpoint, but couldn't exist in real 3D space. For instance, a platform jutting out low down on one tower might form a bridge to the top of a neighbouring structure with a simple 90-degree twist - things like that.</p>
<p>As you progress, the structures and mechanics get infinitely more interesting as platforms turn in on themselves and expectations invert in surprising ways which are best discovered on your own — especially for a short game like this — but the basic goal is always the same: create a clear pathway for your character and navigate to the next objective.</p>

<p>As with the previous games, there's a gentle narrative of self-discovery, here centred around sailing and restoring a lighthouse in a small ocean hub. It touches on familiar themes: relationships, responsibility, the friends we make and lose, recovery when all hope seems lost, and bringing colour back to a desolate world.</p>
<p>It's beautifully presented and animated, and touching in its way, although 'familiar' is the word. It's so delicately and deftly presented — with an injection of character that elevates it beyond just beautifully shaded shapes and illusory puzzle play — that you can't help but go with it. But if you've been playing anything outside mainstream blockbusters for the last decade, only the puzzles will surprise you.</p>
<p>That and the lack of touchscreen controls, perhaps. Instead, you use a fairly subtle circular cursor to select where you want Noor to go. Holding 'A' on an interactable element makes it movable with a push or prod of the stick. This black dot 'adheres' to any surface you can walk on (rather than floating freely across the screen), and while it's not inelegant, it's also not flawless.</p>

<p>Various times, I was prodding the stick to shift a single space to a neighbouring block, but then overshot and found myself readjusting for several seconds. You can change the sensitivity in the options, but after a touchscreen's intuitiveness, any faff whatsoever feels jarring.</p>
<p>These games have always been a case of quality over quantity, and including all my note-taking and experimentation, I spent no more than two hours getting through the 11 chapters currently in the game. It was supposed to have the full Garden of Life DLC included at launch, although that's now coming as part of a larger update sometime later in 2025. You're investing in an incomplete package at launch, then, although it could do with another round of tweaks and polish to get that quality up to the standards you expect from Ustwo.</p>
<p>Nothing is game-breaking or enough to distract you from the brilliance of the base game - there are just some rough edges and glitches which stick out (I played Ver. 1. 218712). My boat jittered a bit as the eyeball on the sail blinked. Text flashed up for a split second before the 'unravel' animation began. Credits appeared garbled as department and position titles couldn't be found to display correctly above the names. <em>(EN - Some of these issues have reportedly been fixed in a day one patch)</em></p>

<p>The game itself runs fine, with performance taxing the Switch a little in the open-ocean segment, although its effect is negligible on a game as sedate as this one. Testing on Switch 2, these hiccups are predictably smoothed over. I'm confident the little 'glitch' issues will be addressed in due course, but juxtaposing them with the otherwise stellar presentation, it's just noticeable.</p>
<p>Visually, MV3 is a festival of colour with some surprising and welcome variation between chapters, and it all looks pleasantly crisp on Switch - and predictably lovely on the OLED Model. The orchestral audio is a treat, too, gently enhancing the mood of the tranquil pastel stone architecture, the ominous polygonal waves, and the more surreal places the story takes you.</p>
<p>It all comes together to make an accessible puzzler of real depth and beauty, but one that doesn't quite reach its potential on a platform that offers the best of all worlds. According to the developers, after testing the functionality and finding that it led to frustration, there are no plans at this time to implement touchscreen controls on Switch. I get that the added screen real estate might make touch input less precise than on mobile, but with the cursor also lacking precision, I wonder if it would be worse.</p>

<p>Maybe adding pinch-to-zoom creates other problems, but you would (or at least I did) expect those to be solved if you're putting out Monument Valley on this platform. It feels like a fundamental oversight that a game originally developed on a touchscreen device <em>doesn't</em> include that input on Switch. Likewise, the gyro in the Joy-Con and Pro Controllers could be used for pointer controls (see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/world_of_goo_2">World of Goo 2</a>). Given the premium you pay on Switch over the mobile apps, you might expect this option to be present, too.</p>
<p>The team is apparently open to feedback, so it's not impossible that touch input could be added in the future. Its absence isn't a dealbreaker, and this remains a wonderful piece of work. It does, however, make for a confounding first impression which doesn't have the time to completely wear off over the game's short runtime.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The confusing lack of touch controls aside, Monument Valley 3 lives up to its predecessors as an excellent little puzzler with mind-tickling structures and stunning presentation sewn together with a delicate narrative thread. That you're able to see some of the developmental stitching show through at launch is a surprise given the polish and reputation of this developer and series, but it's ultimately not enough to significantly affect your enjoyment of this slight but satisfying game.</p></section>
