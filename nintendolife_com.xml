<p>Keep the tunes coming</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Music" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91fb6f12f0df5/nintendo-music.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out its latest update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> mobile app, and the biggest change seems to be the arrival of "some features" for anyone who let their Nintendo Switch Online membership expire.</p>
<p>That "some features" all sounds pretty mysterious, doesn't it? Well, that's exactly how the Big N phrases it in the ver. 1.3.0 patch notes, only detailing the ability for expired subs to "delete their personal playlists". It's likely that there are more additions for those without a membership anymore (this is "feature<em>s</em>", plural, after all), but we're still looking for them.</p>
<p>An active Nintendo Switch Online membership is still required to get started on the app and to actually listen to the music, but at least you'll be able to prune your playlists if you let your membership expire and you're yet to renew.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other tweaks besides this in the latest update, with the new version improving app functionality for particularly beefy playlists, and cleaning up the overall user experience. You'll find the full patch notes (via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">Apple App Store</a>) below:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Music Ver. 1.3.0 (4th August 2025)</h2>
<p>・ We have improved functionality when large numbers of tracks are added to favorites or playlists.</p>
<p>・ Some functions, such as playlist deletion, will continue to be available to Nintendo Music users who cancel their Nintendo Switch Online memberships.</p>
<p>・ We have addressed some issues in order to provide you with a better user experience.</p>

<p>And it's still releasing this year, according to Nintendo!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are all pretty excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>'s arrival at this stage, we think you'll agree. In fact, apart from the ever-elusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, we can't think of another game that's got us biting on our furniture as we wait for further information about when we can actually play the bleddy thing again, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-is-staggering">we loved it so much first time around</a>. Deep breaths.</p>
<p>Now though, Nintendo has just gone and casually announced that lucky gamers who happen to be attending <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/buy-tickets/#multi-day-tier-2">Fan Expo Canada</a> at the end August, will be able to get a hands-on and play the game. They've also, just casually mind, reconfirmed that Samus' latest outing will see a release in the year of our lord 2025. Which is the same year that we are currently in. Hooray for that!</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooPAAaf2Y9seC-9Ow9iIqy8VogVNAAEYA4UWFML6gxabbcr3B07">over on their official website</a>, (cheers, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/04/nintendo-confirms-metroid-prime-4-to-be-playable-at-fan-expo-canada-and-still-due-2025/">MyNintendoNews</a>), Nintendo has had the following exciting statement to make regarding the event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo of Canada is inviting you to visit the Fan Expo Canada in Toronto, Ontario, to check out the latest—and upcoming—games for the Nintendo Switch™ 2 system.</p>
<p>Bring your friends and family to experience games like <strong>Mario Kart™ World</strong>, and the newly released <strong>Donkey Kong™ Bananza</strong>. Fan Expo attendees will be able to play upcoming games like Metroid Prime™ 4: Beyond (available later in 2025). Guests will also be able to play Nintendo’s partner titles such as <strong>Street Fighter™ 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</strong>, and upcoming games Hades II, <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>and ELDEN RING Tarnished Edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a hell of a line-up, and between some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> action, this writer is considering booking some tickets to Toronto for the 21st of August.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Sweating Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44ebc7c7f82fc/donkey-kong-sweating-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever the weather in Japan reached particularly high temperatures throughout the Switch's lifespan, Nintendo would release a statement reminding everyone that the OG hybrid was not cut out for such conditions. As it turns out, the Switch 2 is no different (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-warns-japanese-players-not-to-play-switch-2-in-extreme-temperatures">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>Japan has been experiencing a huge heatwave in recent weeks, with unprecedented temperatures launching the region to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/hot-weather-japan-south-korea-record-breaking-heat">all-time high of 41.2 degrees Celsius</a> (around 106 degrees Fahrenheit). Expectedly, not a lot of household tech is designed to work in this heat, and Nintendo has released a <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651">statement</a> via its Japanese customer support Twitter account to clarify that the Switch 2 is no exception.</p>
<p>The statement reminds everyone that the console is best suited to environments between 5-35 degrees Celsius, with anything outside of this range running the risk of a "malfunction" (via Google Translate). "We have seen several days recently where temperatures have exceeded 35°C," the message concludes, "Please be careful when using the console outdoors".</p>

<p>Now, that bracket is nothing new — Nintendo has issued <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/07/dont-use-your-switch-in-temperatures-exceeding-35c-warns-nintendo">the exact same advice for the Switch 1</a> in the past — but it's still something to pay attention to as the particularly sweaty summer keeps ticking on.</p>

<figure><a title="Missing games from partner showcase 25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d71a8727a49bd/missing-games-from-partner-showcase-25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, we were all quite excited, we think it's fair to say, about Nintendo's Partner Showcase last week and, in the end, it seemed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-switch-2-needed-a-partner-showcase-with-pep-this-wasnt-it">a little light on heavy-hitting or exciting stuff in all honesty</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, we expected a little more sugar, a few surprises to whet our appetites on the third-party front, since the initial wave of excitement, for early adopters at least, may be somewhat wearing off.</p>
<p>Now though, Chris Dring, long-serving game industry journalist, and current Editor-In-Chief and Co-Founder of The Game Business (so he proper knows stuff), has taken to his social media with the following, very teasing, little nugget of info. There were three games missing from the showcase, that he knows of (cheers for the head's up, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/02/chris-dring-says-he-knows-3-games-pulled-from-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase/">MyNintendoNews</a>)!</p>

<p>Hmmm. Well now. Of course, there's no indication of what these games were, but they must have been reasonably sizeable, you would think, for folk to have been made aware of them pre-show. It's not like he's been informed of three unmissable highlight reel games that would have been lost in the mix, we shouldn't think, these may have been somewhat substantial, and somewhat more of what the showcase needed in general.</p>
<p>So what were the games do we reckon? Well, pure speculation, but surely Silksong must have been in the works for a peek...surely? And this particular writer refuses to believe they didn' pull a Vanquish Remastered reveal at the last second (I can dream, can't I?).</p>
<hr>
<p><em>What do you reckon the missing games could have been, and which titles could have made it a better showcase all-round? Make sure to let us know!</em></p></section>

<p>C. Viper returns this Autumn</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following a leak earlier on, Capcom has now officially released the teaser trailer for the next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC character.</p>
<p>The secret agent C. Viper, who originally made her debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>, is scheduled to arrive in Street Fighter 6's World Tour, Battle Hub and Fighting Grounds on <strong>Autumn 2025</strong> for all platforms including the Switch 2.</p>
<p>She's part of the game's third year of DLC, which also includes Sagat (out this week), as well as Alex (<strong>Early Spring 2026</strong>) and Ingrid (<strong>Late Spring 2026</strong>).</p>

<p>In addition to this, Capcom has released a new trailer for the next batch of DLC outfits coming to the game.</p>

<p>Apart from these new trailers for Street Fighter 6, one other Capcom announcement at EVO 2025 was a free title update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>. It's out this week and will add Ingrid as well as multiple other characters to Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and Street Fighter 6 in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life. There's also a demo for the sixth entry available on the Switch 2.</p>
