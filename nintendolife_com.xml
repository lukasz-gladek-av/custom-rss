<figure><a title="Fitness Boxing 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72c977ba4e490/fitness-boxing-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1961111538648899967">Nintendo has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_2_rhythm_and_exercise">Fitness Boxing 2</a> will be taken off of the eShop later this year.</p>
<p>On <strong>2</strong><strong>3rd November 2025 at 23:59</strong>, it will no longer be possible to buy the Nintendo-published game from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Fitness-Boxing-2-Rhythm-Exercise-1843189.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=FitnessBoxing|NULL|ProductDiscontinuation|m_id_2tBvHJYJ48|1843189">digital storefront</a>. If you already own the game digitally, you'll be able to redownload it.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this has only been confirmed <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1961111538648899967">by Nintendo UK on X</a>, but we imagine other regions will follow suit. No reason has been given for the removal, but fans speculate that it's due to the licenses for some in-game music running out.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/19611115386488">https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/19611115386488</a></p>
<p>This happened with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing">Fitness Boxing</a> game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/fitness-boxing-is-being-removed-from-switch-eshop-later-this-year">back in 2023</a>, but just like that game you can also pick up a physical copy.</p>
<p>Presumably, Fitness Boxing 3 is safe for now, but given that this has happened with the first two games, it wouldn't be surprising if 3 was removed later down the line.</p>

<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ed5c383092fc/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>We were pleased to see Bloober Team pop up at last month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> with the announcement that its upcoming sci-fi survival horror <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> will also be arriving on Switch 2 on <strong>5th September</strong>. It's nice to see a Nintendo system treated to the same scares as the other big players in the industry and, as it turns out, the developer has big plans to keep the relationship rolling in the future.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>, Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno said that he's a huge Nintendo fan, so bringing Cronos to Switch 2 is an attempt to make his "personal dreams come true". Citing the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> ("the most important horrors," according to Babieno), the CEO referred to the GameCube's horror scene as a "gold time for Nintendo fans" — something he's keen to bring back.</p>
<p>"In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now," Babieno said of bringing horror games to Switch 2. "We have some plans," he teased, "We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team".</p>
<p>As the team behind last year's critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, this is an exciting prospect. Throw on top the solid previews so far of Cronos: The New Dawn, and our overall good time going hands-on with the Switch 2 version at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-cronos-the-new-dawn-on-switch-2">Gamescom</a>, and we're even more enthused by the mere prospect of more chills and thrills coming our way from the company.</p>
<p>But that's not to say any future Bloober Team plans would necessarily be 'more of the same'. Babieno hinted to The Game Business that the studio already has its eye on the strange mid-point between horror and cosy gaming that Nintendo has struck gold on in the past, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> being a stand-out example. "What Kono-san did with this title was pretty impressive," Babieno said of the ghost-busting GameCube launch title, "And I believe that there is a huge possibility to repeat such an idea in the future".</p>

<p>A Bloober Team survival horror with Luigi's Mansion as a touchstone? Count us in! The CEO even drew a comparison between his studio and the Big N in terms of how the team is structured, particularly when it comes to avoiding layoffs for the greater good of the company's future projects (Bloober Team has been one of the few studios that <em>hasn't</em> seen staff cuts in recent years). “I believe that if we have teams that are making great games and understand our DNA, it's much easier to create new projects," Babieno said in the same interview. "I think that this is another parallel with Nintendo, because [it has] a similar spirit of how we are trying to do things".</p>
<p>We have just one week to go before Cronos: The New Dawn arrives on Switch 2. It's a game full of gruesome darkness, but let's hope that the future is as bright as Babieno imagines.</p>

<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b739dee15b50d/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last week or so, we here at Nintendo Life have been having a few spirited debates about when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> might <em>actually</em> launch. By all accounts, it's still scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, but time's ticking by quickly, and we're still very much in the dark.</p>
<p>Frankly, after literal years of waiting, it feels good to finally talk about Prime 4's release date without feeling the need to plaster our faces with clown makeup (yeah, it's not just you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> fans). But here's the thing: Nintendo's schedule over the next few months is looking reasonably healthy, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</a> launching <em>today</em>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> following on <strong>16th October</strong>, and finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> on <strong>20th November</strong>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is also due in Winter, but this rather broad window means it could potentially come out in January or February 2026.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, assuming Prime 4 doesn't get pushed into 2026 (which, by the way, is definitely possible and shouldn't be ruled out entirely), then logically, we're probably looking at either September or December. There are a couple of us here in 'Camp September' and believe that Nintendo has probably already built up enough hype for the game to pull off a quick and ferocious marketing campaign within just a few weeks.</p>
<p>The rest of us, however, are pretty convinced that we're looking at a potential launch in early December. Rumour has it that we're getting some sort of Nintendo Direct in September, so assuming we finally get a launch date during said presentation, it would afford Nintendo a good two months or so to really drive up interest around the game and launch it without anything else getting in the way.</p>
<p>Of course, it's also not out of the question that the game could launch in either October or November. Audiences for Pokémon and Kirby are quite different to that of Metroid, and while there would certainly be a bit of crossover, we're not sure it would necessarily be enough to negatively impact any of the games in question. Heck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a> launched just one week after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, after all.</p>
<p>But we want to hear from you, dear readers. When do you think might be the most logical time for Metroid Prime 4 to finally launch? Could Nintendo pull off a release in September, or is December looking more likely? Or... <em>gulp</em>... could it be pushed into 2026?</p>
