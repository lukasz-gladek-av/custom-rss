<p>God 'a do it</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>After a lengthy Early Access period, we now finally know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> will be arriving as a Switch 1 &amp; 2 timed console exclusive on <strong>25th September</strong> — that's next week!</p>
<p>It's exciting times for those of us who have been waiting for the full launch all this time, and to make sure that nobody misses a beat, Supergiant Games has announced the exact times that the god-like roguelike sequel will arrive on the Switch eShop in each region.</p>
<p>The times were shared in a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lz54umuubc2e">BlueSky</a>, and we've assembled the following list so you know the appropriate time to hop onto the eShop wherever you are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 9am PDT / 10am MDT / 11am CDT / 12pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 5pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 6pm CEST / 7pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 1am (Fri) JST / 12am (Fri) AWST / 2am (Fri) AEST</li></ul>


<p>As a reminder, Hades II will set you back <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> and there's even a free upgrade path to the 120fps Switch 2 edition if you opt for the S1 version at launch.</p>
<p>Those after the physical edition (which is complete-on-cart, we might add) will have to wait a little longer to get their hands on the game, with Supergiant announcing that boxes won't be hitting shelves until 20th November.</p>

<p>UK, Australia, and the US affected</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Eager <strong>Trails</strong> fans, old and new, are getting their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> today, the remake of the 2004 RPG from Falcom that kicked off the Trails series. With Limited Run Games and Clear River Games handling Steelbook and Bracer Editions, a lot of love and care seems to have gone into this remake.</p>
<p>But today, both physical edition publishers have revealed that they've hit issues in getting those special editions in the hands of some customers (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lz6vmo4zuc23">Wario64</a>)</p>
<p>Limited Run Games has been emailing those who pre-ordered the game about "unexpected manufacturing delays" for both the steelbook and Bracer Edition, and that these will now be "shipping out later than the initially planned date of September 19, 2025."</p>

<p>Over on X (formerly Twitter), European distributor <a href="https://x.com/clearrivergames/status/1968993500042547307?s=19">Clear River Games states</a> that "We began fulfilling all Trails in the SKy steelbook orders earlier this week, despite the games arriving at our warehouse later than expected due to production delays."</p>
<p>While it has managed to ship orders across the EU, the UK, Australia, and other regions, "complications with our shipping partner" have caused other regions to be hit by delays.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Clear River says it has finally found a solution, and the remaining orders will be shipped today. Hopefully this bodes well for Limited Run Games pre-orders too.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed the wait isn't too long for those of you who are big Trails fans — the remake has been getting rave reviews, and this is the perfect entry point for newcomers, too.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like we're essentially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-contains-teaser-for-the-sequel">guaranteed to get a remake of the sequel</a>, given what footage has been shared online by those who go to the game early.</p>
