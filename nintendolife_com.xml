<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Rainbow Road" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/053a632e731bd/mario-kart-world-rainbow-road.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has only been out for a month, but as you'd expect, speedrunners are already aiming to destroy race track times in the game's Time Trial mode, and a familiar face is already dominating the competition on one particular track (thanks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/611310/mario-kart-world-rainbow-road-record-twitch">Polygon</a>!).</p>
<p>Twitch streamer and <strong>Geometry Dash</strong> expert <a href="http://twitch.tv/technicaljl">Technical</a> is the current world record holder in the new iteration of Rainbow Road after spending over a hundred hours perfecting the course and tricking his way to the best time.</p>
<p>In Time Trial mode, Rainbow Road is broken up into four sections, with each section taking over a minute on average for your garden variety Mario Kart World player. Yet Technical has managed to complete the entire course in 3:39:987, and he's currently on top.</p>
<p>The world record has been in flux ever since the game's release, with the leader changing 34 times over the course of the past month. Technical is the very first person to break the four-minute barrier, which means the game is well and truly on at this point. Have a watch below.</p>

<p>This <em>should</em><em>n't</em> be a huge surprise, however; Technical is also the world record holder for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a>'s Rainbow Road (<a href="https://mkwrs.com/mk8dx/display.php?track=Rainbow+Road&amp;m=200">on 200cc</a>). So you could say he's a bit of an expert at the multicoloured course.</p>
<p>Many thought hitting the sub-four minute mark would take a lot longer than it has, but many players have been extremely close to breaking that barrier, but a combination of track length and a late-race trick have proven difficult.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye on this over the coming months — and likely years. Perhaps 3:55 is the next milestone?</p>

<p>"Man, that was seriously lame"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You might remember prior to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>'s launch in 2022 that a bit of controversy made the rounds online regarding voice actor Hellena Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor, who had voiced the titular protagonist in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_2">Bayonetta 2</a>, had been replaced by Jennifer Hale following a pay dispute with PlatinumGames. This was brought to the forefront by Taylor herself via a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-given-the-voice-artist-controversy-will-you-be-boycotting-bayonetta-3">video message posted to social media</a>, with the resulting fallout leading to abuse thrown left, right, and centre to Taylor, Hale, and even the series' writer, Hideki Kamiya.</p>
<p>In a new video from Kamiya, the creator addressed the fallout from the controversy in response to a fan's question, opting to avoid discussing the controversy itself, but rather the way others had treated him online following the whole drama.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was wild. My Twitter timeline was just flying by in real time – it was insane. Just nonstop scrolling. I kept blocking nonstop, though. But even my speed I couldn't keep up. So I was like 'What?! They're coming in faster than I can block them? WHAT?!'</p>
<p>"Anyway, that's not the point. People were saying whatever they wanted. Even famous people were jumping in and throwing comments at me. And then, once things calmed down, I went back and looked – and they had quietly deleted their tweets. Hey, apologise to me first before you do anything sneaky. That's some real coward s***.</p>
<p>"You posted it publicly on social media, right? So if you were wrong, you should publicly admit it. Say "Hey, I messed up" – own it. At least that's how I try to be. I may act like this, but I do have my own code. If I'm not wrong? Then no, I absolutely won't apologise. No chance. But when I am wrong, I'll own it properly.</p>
<p>"Man, that was seriously lame."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although not mentioned by Kamiya himself, one of the "famous people" he spoke about was supposedly the voice actor Bryan Dechart, who perhaps most notably played Connor in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/detroit_become_human">Detroit: Become Human</a>. As demonstrated by a screengrab shown on-screen in the video, Dechart had tweeted to Kamiya to say "Those who treat others well are treated well in return. You make us all sad. Greed is ugly".</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems the controversy is, by and large, behind us now. Bayonetta 3 launched to widespread critical acclaim, though its future is undoubtedly uncertain following the departure from Kamiya from PlatinumGames. He is now working on a sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a> in collaboration with Capcom.</p>

<figure><a title="18 Months And $200,000 Later, Switch Lite Gets OLED And HDMI-Out - And Switch 2 Is Getting OLED Next 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d8badcbdfd074/18-months-and-usd200000-later-switch-lite-gets-oled-and-hdmi-out-and-switch-2-is-getting-oled-next-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942589075359424700">Taki Udon</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>We've covered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/switch-lite-oled-modder-showcases-the-stunning-dinky-screen-in-motion">Taki Udon's work</a> in the past, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/switch-2-may-be-imminent-but-im-loving-this-custom-switch-lite-oled">specifically the excellent Super5 OLED screen mod for the Switch Lite</a>. This upgrade gives the smallest Switch a far superior display to the one it ships with, but the modder wasn't content to stop there; he's also been working on another update which introduces support for HDMI-out.</p>
<p>It has not been an easy journey, as Taki Udon points out on social media. "18 months of R&amp;D, just as many failed revisions, and more than $200K in costs. SUPER5 OLED HDMI is finally done," he says. "This is the first fully assembled device in the world. You can't imagine how relieved I am that it works. This was the most difficult project I've ever worked on."</p>
<p>The modder goes on to explain the <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942600677542486340">mental anguish</a> this particular venture has caused him. "I can't describe how soul-crushing it was to go through so many failed revisions. After the 3rd failure, I was hopeful every subsequent version would be successful, but they weren't. And when you do fail, you are looking at a minimum of 2 weeks to try again."</p>

<p>As you can see in the video above, plugging the Switch Lite into an external screen automatically turns off the console's main display and instantly sends the image to the connected display. Sadly, it's not possible to have the image on both screens at the same time, as <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942595350403113160">Taki Udon says</a> the signal "wasn't stable" with dual input.</p>
<p>Taki Udon also reveals that this project is unlikely to recoup its costs, given the sheer amount of time and materials that have gone into getting to this stage. "I gave up on recoup after the 3rd revision failed," <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942590890671043020">he says.</a></p>
<p>The modder – who also produced the excellent <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/mister-pi-a-usd99-gateway-to-fpga-retro-gaming">MiSTer Pi</a> and is currently working on the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/01/heres-your-best-look-yet-at-taki-udons-superstation-one-fpga-ps1-and-you-can-order-it-now">SuperStation</a> system – then <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942596968464970095">reveals</a> that he plans to create an OLED mod for the Switch 2 next.</p>
