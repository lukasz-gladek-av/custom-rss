<figure data-uuid="b785bf92565b4"><a title="Mario Kart LEGO Luigi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b785bf92565b4/mario-kart-lego-luigi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If this month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lego-pokemon-reveals-first-sets-launches-february-2026">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zeldas-next-lego-set-is-based-on-ocarina-of-times-final-battle-out-march">Ocarina of Time</a> sets didn't break the bank for you, LEGO and Nintendo have today teased another entry in the 'Adult' Mario Kart line, and it looks like the brother in green is taking centre stage.</p>
<p>The tease in question was shared to Nintendo of America and LEGO socials, and sees <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/new-18plus-lego-mario-kart-set-is-a-better-build-than-we-expected">last year's Mario Kart set</a> geared up and ready to go before a mysterious figure emerges on the right side of the screen. It's far from a detailed look at the set, but the green cap, arm, and accompanying caption, "Racing runs in the family," all but confirm it.</p>

<p>Neither Nintendo nor LEGO has revealed any pricing information or a release date for the Luigi Mario Kart set just yet, but for reference, the Mario counterpart went up for £149.99 / $169.99 last year, so we'd be surprised if it's <em>much</em> more than that.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more information down the line, but gosh, what a year to be a LEGO / Nintendo fan — and what a bad year to be money conscious...</p>

<p>It's the Obstagoon Parade!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company is back with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion of 2026, and it's a <em>fantastical</em> one.</p>
<p>The 'Fantastical Parade' set launches on <strong>28th January</strong> at <strong>5pm PST / 1am GMT (29th) / 2am CET (29th)</strong>, featuring none other than Gardevoir on the cover. This one throws in a couple of new Mega ex cards for Gardevoir, Mawile and Teal Mask Ogerpon, as well as a particularly fetching full art card of Falinks.</p>
<p>The above trailer provides a pretty decent overview of what we can expect from the expansion, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>Fantastical Parade will also see the introduction of Stadium cards into TCG Pocket, which, much like the regular card game, can apply effects over the entire battle.</p>
<p>With just one week until this one arrives, it might be a good time to start saving your Pack Hourglasses.</p>

<p>35% more than the PS4</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a3865a73ba47d"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3865a73ba47d/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 ended 2025 with a total of <strong>4.4 million units</strong> sold in the US, according to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczduu7kxc2b">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>
<p>This means that after its seventh month on the market, Nintendo's new system is still the fastest-selling home console in US history. Piscatella noted afterwards that the Game Boy Advance is the overall winner in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this means that the Switch 2's install base is nearly double that of its predecessor after the same amount of time. It's also roughly 35% ahead of the PS4 over the same amount of time, which was remarkably popular when it launched back in 2013.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's sales had slowed down somewhat over the Christmas period, falling by around 35% compared to the original Switch during the same period. It seems, however, to have had little effect on the console's overall performance.</p>
<p>Concerns around potential price rises persist as the US grapples with tariffs and the rapid rise of AI, but overall, it seems Nintendo's new console is off to the best start we could have possibly hoped for.</p>
