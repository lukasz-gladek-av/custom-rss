<figure data-uuid="66625e46e2bb9"><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/66625e46e2bb9/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 and eShop exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has today received a new game update, bumping it up to Version 1.2.0.</p>
<p>This follows an update in September and comes loaded with general updates and multiple fixes. It also makes some changes to Drag x Drive: Global Jam. It's been renamed the Drag x Drive Demo and certain bot games can be played at any time now.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Drag x Drive - Version 1.2.0 (Released 1st December, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytepMKq3hLRsg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0jvhzio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>Added the chasing game Survival Tag to friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: To play Survival Tag when in the parks listed above, the player who created the park opens the X Menu, then selects <strong>Start Survival Tag</strong> on the Players tab.</li>
<li>Depending on the wireless environment, there may be times where player positioning does not perfectly match between users. For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression. Therefore, it has been designed such that a tag is considered successful if there was contact from either perspective (the tagging player, or the one who was tagged).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrected the calculation of Iso Wins on the Game Stats tab under Stats. Previously, it counted the total number of Isos, not just wins.</li>
<li>Added Rope Jumps to Other Stats tab under Stats.</li>
<li>Changed the target of the Focus Cam when near the sumo ring to the sumo ring itself.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to bots in friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: We slightly lowered the strength level of the Easy and Standard bots that the player who created the park can add under the Players tab of the X Menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a feature to enable players to delete their own records.
<ul>
<li>On the screen that displays players’ records before starting time trials or shooting contests, simultaneously press and hold the ZL Button, left directional button, and right directional button on the Joy-Con 2 (L) for 10 seconds to delete the record.</li>
<li>Once deleted, records cannot be restored.</li>
<li>Obtained trophies will remain, even if records are deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a very rare issue where, due to unintended behavior, the displays for level or total distance would reach the upper limit.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue in Circuit Sprint where players sometimes passed through terrain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bunny hops made it possible to accelerate to and maintain speed that exceeded top speed.
<ul>
<li>The intended design is that it is only possible to accelerate beyond the normal top speed when driving down a slope or successfully pulling off a halfpipe or ramp trick. However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed. We fixed this because this issue required players to control their character in unintuitive ways in order to achieve good results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Version 1.1.1 for the <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em> (formerly <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em>) was also released.</p>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed software title from <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em> to <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em>.</li>
<li>Changed the software icon that displays in locations such as the HOME Menu.</li>
<li>Made it possible to play the tutorial and certain bot games any time.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>This bundle deal is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy for <strong>$449</strong> instead of the usual $499, so you're saving $50. This is the first time the bundle has been on sale in this location and gives you access to the new entry in the Mario Kart series at no extra cost (instead of having to fork out extra).</p>
<p>A regular Switch 2 bundle is normally priced at $449, so this current offer on the Mario Kart World bundle brings it down to the same price. Nintendo also previously mentioned how the Mario World Bundle would be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-will-be-a-limited-time-offer">"limited time production" through to Fall 2025</a> in the US and is available "while supplies last".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has only recently passed the six-month mark in its life, and Nintendo has not officially discounted or reduced the price of the new unit, so this latest offer might be worth considering if you were hoping to save some coin.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1122ece876094"><a title="Sonic the Hedgehog 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1122ece876094/sonic-the-hedgehog-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Paramount Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>Paramount has revealed some of its future movie plans, but for us, the biggest draw is that Sonic the Hedgehog will be getting a brand new spin-off movie in 2028.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">Variety</a> reports that this upcoming spin-off is currently untitled, but it's being referred to to as the "Sonic Universe Event Film". It will launch in cinemas on <strong>22nd December 2028</strong>. More than three years away!</p>
<p>Note that this <em>isn't</em> the planned Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie, which is coming out in <strong>March 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>We have no other details right now, but there are a lot of opportunities to branch out in the Sonic universe, with tons of untapped characters and other video games the movies can draw from.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like a no-brainer to expand the Sonic movie universe — the first three films have all received warm critical reception, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie">particularly Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, and fans seem to absolutely love them.</p>
<p>Collectively, the franchise has made over $1 billion at the box office and spawned a TV show focusing on Knuckles the Echidna, so more movies surely means more money.</p>
<p>We at least have some idea of who will feature in the Sonic 4 movie, so we'll have to excitedly wait and see on what the Sonic Universe movie will bring.</p>
