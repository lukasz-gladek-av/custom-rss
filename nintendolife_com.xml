<p>Say hello to the newest fighter</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After a cheeky little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-teases-new-playable-character">tease</a> last week, Super Evil Megacorp has today lifted the lid on the next wave of content heading to the TMNT roguelike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_splintered_fate">Splintered Fate</a> â€” and, brace yourselves, there's quite a lot.</p>
<p>The game will be landing a beefy free content update on <strong>30th September</strong>, with a new game mode, fresh levels, a bonus storyline, visual upgrades, and more all arriving as standard. What's more, a new batch of paid DLC will be cropping up on the same day, adding a fresh-faced playable character: Metalhead.</p>
<p>Let's start with those paid extras. Metalhead is Splintered Fate's first full-range fighter, bringing a laser gun and landmines to the game's usual hack-and-slash play style. Aside from the metallic menace, the DLC also includes five new artefacts to beef up your boost options mid-run.</p>
<p>But the real meat comes in the free update. The biggest addition for <em>all</em> players is the new Arcade Mode, which offers a fast-paced way to play through some combat with pals. There are new enemies and locales to get to grips with in this mode, and a new 'Hex and Flex' system that promises to mix up each run for the better (or worse).</p>
<p>The free update also includes a host of fun features like a new artefact, Drone Tools for passive ranged support, a 'Robotics Turtle Power Tree', and the bonus 'Pizza in Peril' storyline, which spins off from the new game mode.</p>

<p>And this is an <em>update</em>, so the dev also promises a bunch of fixes, quality-of-life improvements, balancing adjustments and more. The update notes on the <a href="https://superevilmegacorp.com/news/tmnt-splintered-fate-brings-its-biggest-ever-update/">Super Evil Megacorp website</a> even claim that there are some visual improvements to boot. <em>Totally tubular!</em></p>
<p>All in all, it feels like it might be a good time to give Splintered Fate another go. We had a good time with this radical roguelike when it first arrived on Switch last year, but felt that the natural comparisons to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> were never going to work in its favour.
