<p>Wake up to the sounds of Kirby</p>

<p>In case you somehow missed it, Nintendo has an alarm clock that it occasionally updates with new (and free) themes.</p>
<p>In an announcement on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/f78d6765-cbb2-450a-b974-61ecbd756989">official Japanese website</a>, there'll be new sounds based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> added to Nintendo Alarmo in a future update, including seven different alarm types.</p>
<p>Here's a rough translation, which also notes how some alarms based on the new DLC will be added. When this information is shared locally, we'll provide an update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There will be seven new alarms , including songs from "Starry World." Please wait for further announcements regarding the release date of the alarms."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this announcement lines up with the release of the Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land today, along with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Star-Crossed World</a> content, which is also available to existing owners as an upgrade.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Alarmo also received free themes based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> and Super Mario. This latest Kirby-themed update follows the news of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> event and an update to the Forgotten Land soundtrack on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app.</p>

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4853f9b8731ad/final-fantasy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following some reports about the performance and visual presentation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2, Square Enix has now officially confirmed the title's frame rate.</p>
<p>Switch 2 users can expect this upcoming release to run at a "stable 30 frames per second" while also offering "smooth performance" as well as some slick visuals. Here's the company's <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1960711660592873862">official update about this via its social channels</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Square Enix:</strong> "Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second offering smooth performance and crisp visuals."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we don't have official specs detailing other aspects of the Switch 2 release just yet, Digital Foundry's John Linneman <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">recently gave this version high praise</a>, calling it the "best-looking thing" he's seen on the Switch 2 so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>I'm gonna say right now, this is the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2. Seeing that game running at a stable 30fps, with that excellent motion blur especially, it looked fantastic. It was completely stable, it looked on par – actually I would say it looks better than the PS4 version, at a glance.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo Life video producer Felix Sanchez went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-on-switch-2">hands on with this title at Gamescom</a>, so if you want to find out more about how the Switch 2 version holds up, check out our previous story. This title is currently scheduled to launch this winter.</p>

<p>It's a deep nest</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/765883a9dbb65/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you've been living in the deepest, darkest cave imaginable, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is <em>finally</em> launching next week, on 4th September 2025. Fans have been waiting years to get their hands on the sequel to the critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, and suddenly, we have just over a week to go.</p>
<p>Team Cherry has sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-has-now-sold-almost-15-million-copies">almost 15 million copies of its hit hand-drawn Metroidvania</a>, but there are still many out there who have yet to dive into Hallownest.</p>
<p>Some have likely bought the game and just never tried it, while others have played a little bit and fallen off. Or, Silksong's announcement might have pushed a handful of people to finally pick up it. Incredibly, the game reached a record number of CCUs (concurrently connected users) on Steam following Silksong's Release Trailer — over <em>eight years</em> since its original release.</p>

<p>We imagine a good chunk of players are those revisiting the game, but that's still an impressive figure. Here at Nintendo Life, editor Gavin Lane has finally started his long trek through the bug world, while this writer here is <em>strongly</em> considering a quick third playthrough, or perhaps even an elusive P5 clear.</p>
<p>Essentially, the hype for Silksong has a bunch of people doing some homework, either seeing what the fuss is all about or refreshing their memories. Has it got you hankering for some tough boss fights and exploration?</p>
<p><em>Let us know how you're preparing for Silksong by voting in our poll below — is this your first time playing Hollow Knight? Are you dipping back in for a second time? Third? Fourth? Tell us!</em></p>
