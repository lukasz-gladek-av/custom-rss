<p>According to <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/12/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-promotion-coming-to-the-u-s-for-franchises-30th-anniversary">a report from PokéBeach</a>, it will run from February into March, with exact dates depending on the country, but that's all the details known right now.</p>
<p>Past events — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/scalpers_and_collectors_buy_up_mcdonalds_pokemon_happy_meals">for the 25th anniversary, for example</a> — have seen scalpers rocking up to stores and buying <em>dozens</em> of Happy Meals to get the cards. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/mcdonalds_uk_plans_to_restrict_pokemon_happy_meal_toy_purchases">McDonald's in the UK</a> put a restriction on buying more than one extra card with your meal following the frenzy in the US, but that feels like trying to stop a geyser with a bathplug.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvjqwmy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The Pokémon Company and Ronald have persevered, though - there was a Dragon-type collab <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-cards-soar-back-into-mcdonalds-uk-happy-meals">earlier in 2025</a>. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">back in August</a>, a three-day Pikachu event in Japan was stopped after 24 hours when demand for the card exceeded supply, with boxes of unopened cards turning up for sale online. <em>Shifty.</em> That one was particularly sought after, though, as the card featured exclusive artwork.</p>
<p>It's a shame that Pokémon cards just seem to attract a manic mix of the FOMO crowd (ask the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/van-gogh-museum-fires-four-employees-following-pokemon-collaboration">Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum</a>) and straight-up scalpers, bringing out the worst in people who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-scalpers-are-ignoring-tornado-warnings-just-to-nab-latest-card-collection">ignore tornado warnings</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/random-try-not-to-cringe-watching-this-video-of-a-pokemon-tcg-scalper">behave atrociously</a> to get their hands on fresh packs.</p>
<p>We'll see in February if TPC and McDonald's have any clever plans to combat the problem.</p>
