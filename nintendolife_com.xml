<p>Plus Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake gets new trailer</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a70ab0909dfec/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Intrepid adventurers, if you've been holding off on playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> and have a Switch 2, today's news might come as a nice little incentive.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoWsrW02ja4">during the Japanese Nintendo Direct</a>, Square Enix has dropped a free performance update for the excellent turn-based RPG. The update adds a new option in the game's Display settings, as well as gives the game an overall resolution bump. Oh, and it's out right now.</p>
<p>Now, you can choose between Performance Mode, where the game will run at 60fps but with slightly blurrier visuals (but much better than they are on Switch 1), or Graphics Mode, which gives you some gorgeously crisp visuals at the cost of the game running at 30fps. You can find details on the update <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq3/faq/en.html">on the official website</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/541d08c305ded/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No more choppy waters. Or pixels. — <em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not the only Dragon Quest news for today, however. We also got a brand new trailer for Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, which is coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 on 30th October.</p>
<p>One thing previous trailers have teased is the addition of a new character to Dragon Quest II, and we now know who that is — the Princess of Cannock. That means they're more than likely the sister to one of the other party members, the Prince of Cannock.</p>
<p>An English version of the trailer dropped earlier, so have a watch.</p>

<p>Unlike the free performance update for DQIII, I &amp; II is getting a native Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release. So far, Square Enix has said <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">there will be no upgrade path to the Switch 2 version</a>, which is also a Game Key-Card release.</p>
<p>It does look good though, and at least from the Japanese Partner Showcase, it looks smooth as butter on Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45577cb8ff836/pac-man-world-2-re-pac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not one to be disappointed often, especially with Directs. Yes, even Partner Showcases — some of the <em>best</em> Directs have been these third-party lead ones, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKB3WXRWTCM&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">June 2022's Mini Partner Showcase</a> ranking pretty highly for me.</p>
<p>Today's Partner Showcase was not one of those, which maybe hit a little harder because this was our first Direct post-Switch 2's launch.</p>
<p>It feels like we're in a new era for Nintendo, where release dates and brand new games can just randomly pop up on a news app, and the Switch 2 is now getting day-and-date ports like Bloober's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>; a cool little surprise for you horror fans out there. This Partner Showcase felt like it was ushering in that era.</p>
<p>But, for anyone watching who was maybe on the fence on buying Nintendo's shiny new console, this probably wasn't the Direct for you. I'm not sure if Partner Showcases have <em>ever</em> been targeted at people without the console, given that they focus on multiplatform releases, but when your console is brand new and you need a hook for people? This perhaps wasn't the greatest lineup.</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7195e7845c5d8/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I did make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-partner-direct-predictions-what-do-you-expect-to-see">one wild prediction</a> that was <em>never</em> going to happen (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a>, my beloved), I'm more than a little shocked that we still have a ton of games shown off during the April Direct that don't have release dates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, despite getting rated in June, is still MIA on Switch 2; a date would've lit the bonfires, or Sites of Grace, I guess. Instead, we get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, which looks cute and, importantly (for Nintendo, at least), uses GameChat and other Switch 2 exclusive features. But it's not a headliner, is it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, all of these games are sitting with a vague "2025" or "Winter" date, and they remain untouched (I think Silksong news is a Gamescom lock-in, though, given that it's playable there).</p>
<p>One of the games that did show up was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I thought for sure we'd get a date for that, but nope, still just "Winter". The trailer felt like a little poke, a reminder that the game exists. But hey, at least we saw a Champion's face <em>and</em> got a glimpse at a new construct.</p>

<p>I promise it wasn't all mediocre for me. My favourite game of the show should be pretty obvious to those who know me; it's a Square Enix HD-2D game, but not the one that <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-nos-predictions-pour-le-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-du-31-juillet-60313">was rumoured to be showing up</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the name, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> looks <em>lovely</em> and is exactly where I wanted Team Asano to go with HD-2D; not just a remake, something a little different, and an action RPG. It gives me a little bit of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a> vibe — multiple weapon types that you can upgrade, a small open world... Oh, and there's couch co-op! You know I've already downloaded the demo.</p>
<p>Sticking with Square Enix, I was worried <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> was going to be a port of <strong>Champions of the Continent</strong>, the mobile game. It's not, as Square Enix confirmed in <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/nintendo-direct-31-july-2025">a blog post</a>, and instead uses the mobile game as a base. And good lord, there's <em>town</em> building? Help me. And, as a little bonus, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Romancing SaGa 2</a>'s remake also gives me a good reason to finally play this one.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> is at last coming to a Nintendo console — it's a fantastic remake and, whether you've played FES or Portable or never touched the game at all, is well worth grabbing. I'm always happy to see a new Katamari game on Switch, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> looks delightful. And, while I've never played a game in this series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> looks pretty darn good, too.</p>
<p>If we were a year or two into the new console's life, I think this'd be a pretty solid Direct. Not earth-shattering, but a nice little cherry on top of the foundation already built. But we're not. We're not even two months in. So it's hard not to feel a little deflated.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because we're in a time when having multiple consoles is more common; my Switch 2 is, of course, my main platform right now, but I've already played Persona 3 Reload and I already own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> on PS4. Again, both great additions to the new system, and I know there's a bunch of people who want to play these games afresh or have yet to play them. Though the steady trickle of Game-Key Card confirmations for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2</a>, Octopath Traveler 0, and a few others seems to be dampening the mood.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's more-powerful specs, even when games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> looked a little rough, open the floodgates for a more mainstream suite of ports, like a feature-rich <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a>, and like Cronos. This is probably the new normal, so we're going to have to get used to it.</p>
<p>But even if you had modest expectations like me, I think many will feel a bit let down with today's showcase, particularly us early Switch 2 adopters. Fortunately, we've got plenty to look forward to — even if the very best stuff still doesn't have a release date. Honestly, Nintendo, how can you stick Hyrule Warriors in a Direct and not even give us a date...? Or a month?</p>
<p>I'm sure a full-fat Nintendo Direct, or even an Indie World later in the year, will be enough to satiate. But for now, I'm left wanting a little more from my new console.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> is coming to Switch 2 only, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</a> is lined up for both Switch 1 and 2 - and Square Enix has confirmed there'll be no way to upgrade a Switch 1 version of the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/square-enix-games.com/post/3lvbhnvp7ys2m">Posting on Bluesky</a>, the publisher says that if you buy the Switch 1 version, you won't be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 version via an Upgrade Pack.

<blockquote>
<p>[Note about the Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch versions 1/2]<br>
The Switch 2 versions (both the physical and digital versions) can only be played on Nintendo Switch 2.<br>
[2/2]<br>
It is not possible to upgrade from the Switch version to the Switch 2 version once purchased. There are also no plans for an option to upgrade to the Switch 2 version in future. Please make sure you purchase the correct version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other publishers have offered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">Upgrade Packs</a> that let anyone with the Switch 1 game get the upgraded version of the game on the more powerful console but, for whatever reason, Square apparently has no interest in offering this as an option.</p>
<p>As a reminder for anybody out of the loop, Nintendo introduced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a> as an option for publishers on Switch 2. They don't contain any game data, with the cart acting — as the name suggests — as a key that must be inserted in the console, first to download the entire game from the eShop, and subsequently to access the game on your hard drive.</p>
<p>While this means that publishers can get a 'physical' product on store shelves and you have something to put on your own shelf (or resell, if you like), you'll still need to have the game downloaded and taking up storage space on your system - and you'll need the card inserted to play it.</p>
<p>Players' reaction to Game-Key Cards from players has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">largely negative</a>, although the option to get a physical copy of the Switch 1 game and then get the digital-only Upgrade Pack for Switch 2 was a compromise some were prepared to make. Zero chance of that here, it seems.</p>
<p>The game's not out until December, so it's possible plans could change. "Please make sure you purchase the correct version" doesn't sound promising, though.</p>

<p>And it's got a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a survival horror fan, you've probably been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a brand new sci-fi third-person shooter where you jump between 1980's Poland and a dystopian future. Previews for the game dropped earlier this week for other platforms, and they seem solid across the board.</p>
<p>Luckily, Switch 2 owners don't need to miss out on the scares, as the game was confirmed to be coming to the new Nintendo console on the same day as other platforms; <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Developed by Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Cronos puts you in the suit of The Traveller who live in a world post "Change", a cataclysm that turned many humans into 'Orphans', monsters who now prowl across the world.</p>
<p>Traveller's job is to jump back in time to the '80s and extract the souls of those who were transformed during the apocalyptic event. Gunplay and combat is thoughtful and you can't just shoot your way through every encounter — even if you want to when a terrifying monster is approaching you.</p>

<p>This was probably the biggest surprise of the Direct for us — a game that's already pretty established getting a Switch 2 version <em>and</em> release date, the same day as other consoles? That's a shock we're willing to accept.</p>
<p>And hey, if previews are anything to go by, this looks pretty solid; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">IGN</a>, <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145273/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">Shacknews</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/after-2-hours-with-the-silent-hill-2-devs-slimy-sci-fi-beast-cronos-im-thrilled-it-has-dead-space-dna-and-the-soul-of-resident-evil-this-is-more-like-a-love-letter-to-survival-horror-than-to-poland/">Gamesradar</a> all have good things to say.</p>
