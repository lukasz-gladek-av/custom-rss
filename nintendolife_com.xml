<p>"I feel like GameChat was made just for Resident Evil'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a new Creator's Voice video, this time focused on Koshi Nakanishi, the director of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>With the game launching later this week on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, the video focuses on providing an introduction to the story along with the wider franchise itself. It also goes into how easy it was to develop Requiem for the Switch 2, with Nakanishi-san promoting features like GameChat for those who might be a bit too scared to play on their own.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 has improved graphical specs, so we wondered if Requiem could run on it – and it did, with ease. When we, the development team, first saw it in our hands, we were sceptical too, so we had to do a triple take. We thought to ourselves 'Oh, this is really running on Nintendo Switch 2?. It all worked so smoothly that we just decided to go ahead with the game as-is and make it for the console. With specs like these in handheld mode, it looks great.</p>
<p>"With Nintendo Switch 2, you also have GameChat. That's perfect for horror games. Even players who think they can't play alone can have fun together just by inviting friends to watch. So I feel like GameChat was made just for Resident Evil."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nakanishi-san also mentions that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/zelda_ii_the_adventure_of_link">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a> is one of his preferred games in the <strong>Zelda</strong> series. When he directed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/resident_evil_revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a> for the 3DS, he designed the Scarmiglione enemies to act in a similar manner to the armoured soldiers in Zelda II, raising their shields up and down to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem are making the rounds online, so be extra careful in these final days leading up to release. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/please-dont-post-or-share-pre-release-leaks-and-spoilers-capcom-sets-its-sights-on-resident-evil-requiem-leakers">Capcom has pleaded with fans</a> not to share any leaks, while original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a> creator Hideki Kamiya has also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-a-thousand-deaths-says-hideki-kamiya">provided his own opinion</a> on the matter.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition (Switch) - Nicely Orchestrated But Misses A Key Note]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition</link>
            <guid>1444651</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman</a> was Ubisoft’s first major commercial success, the company going public a year after its release in 1996. A PlayStation launch title, it was originally conceived for the unreleased Super Nintendo CD-ROM before being developed for Atari’s Jaguar. A fantasy platform game that pops with oil paint colour, its stages encompass themes like the musical Band Land and sugar-laden Candy Chateau.</p>
<p>Rayman, a limbless, affable character, seeks to save the land from Mr Dark, a nefarious sorcerer. To do this, you must free six caged Electoons on each of its 17 stages set across six different worlds. As you earn new powers of combat and scenery traversal, backtracking is necessary to find cages previously out of reach. It’s a simple platform game, but one graced with charm and affection.</p>
<p>Despite the number of Rayman games and spin-offs released, this collection focuses only on the initial game. It includes the PlayStation original, the Atari Jaguar release, those for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, and the MS-DOS PC version. The Sega Saturn release isn't present. While the PlayStation and Jaguar games are largely the same, the Jaguar lacks FMV, doesn’t look or sound as good, and nerfs the ice physics - but has an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/arkanoid">Arkanoid</a>-style minigame included. Originally, it benefited from no loading times over the PlayStation, but that’s moot here.</p>
<p>While Rayman still looks good, its platform collision needs learning and its impressive animation means it takes a couple of seconds to duck and perform other actions. There are also many leaps of faith involved. The Game Boy Color version is the only other game in the collection that’s totally original, and is surprisingly good despite shorter stages. The Game Boy Advance version is cropped in, but like the Game Boy Color is a little cleaner to navigate thanks to fewer animation frames. For some reason, this version suffers frame-rate issues, however.</p>
<p>The MS-DOS release and its add-ons are of most interest, featuring 24 additional stages designed for expert players, 40 stages designed by fans, and another 60 levels designed by Ubisoft. Elsewhere is a single-stage 1992 prototype of the Rayman’s original Super Nintendo build. There’s almost nothing to see or do and it's over in seconds, but it’s interesting to see the game’s origin.</p>
<p>The package includes screen filters, cheats for every game, save states, and a rewind function. Like all Digital Eclipse releases, the History section is superb, charting every beat of its development and featuring over an hour of documentary footage.</p>
<p>If you’re a super fan of the original game and want every possible version of it, the package totally delivers. But considering how many Rayman games there were, including its sequels and spin-offs, it would have been nice to at least have had Rayman 2 included. The elephant in the room, however, is the absence of the original soundtracks. They have been remixed or replaced across the board with a nice composition by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rayman_origins">Rayman Origins</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Legends</a> composer Christophe Héral, likely due to Ubisoft not fully owning the rights to the original audio.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>
