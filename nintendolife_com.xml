Nintendo has finally confirmed that a Nintendo Direct is coming tomorrow, and it's a Partner Showcase.</p>
<p>Kicking things off on <strong>31st July at 6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm BST / 3pm CET</strong>, we'll be treated to 25 minutes of news on third-party games coming to the Switch and Switch 2.</p>

<p>You'll be able to watch the broadcast in all of the usual spots — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/youtube">YouTube</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/7-31-2025/">Nintendo website</a>, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first Nintendo Direct we've had since the Switch 2's launch (not including the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> one), so there should be some exciting news in there! Finger's crossed!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Given all of the rumours and leaks that have been going around the past month, NIS America's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nis-accidentally-reveals-upcoming-switch-2-game-sparking-even-more-direct-speculation">accidentally-leaked new project</a> will likely be popping up, and we think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> might well be getting a date too, as it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-release-date-could-be-revealed-soon-as-switch-2-rating-spotted">was recently rated</a>.</p>
<p>Don't expect any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> news, though...</p>

<figure><a title="Ho-Oh Pokémon TCG Pocket: Wisdom of Sea and Sky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c658c692ace3f/ho-oh-pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Overnight, The Pokémon Company was hit by allegations of plagiarism ahead of the release of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion, <strong>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</strong>. And today, with the release of the expansion, TPC has pulled the card — plus one other card — in question.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">social media</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-suddenly-pulls-card-design-embroiled-in-plagiarism-controversy-as-company-admits-production-issue-and-launches-wider-investigation">IGN</a>), TPC "deeply apologize[s]" for the error, which affects the Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star) cards drawn by SIE NANAHARA, which it puts down to a "production issue". The expansion was datamined yesterday by fans, which is where the card art for Ho-Oh came from.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards". The art has been replaced in-game with a "temporary placeholder".</p>

<p>The team is also "conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game."</p>
<p>The accusations focused on the Ho-Oh card specifically, which appears to be based on fanart art of the Legendary bird from <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu" tabindex="-1">lanjiuji</a>, which they published in 2021.</p>
<p>lanjiuji, confused at the potential plagiarism, shared some <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950044196842459644">comparison pics on social media</a>, and even at a quick glance, you can see that the resemblance is pretty darn close.</p>
<p>They have since released a <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610">statement</a> acknowledging The Pokémon Company's response, stating "My original post stemmed solely from perplexity upon encountering questionable images online, with no means to verify their authenticity as game assets".</p>

<p>"Relieved by the timely resolution, I also thank those who contributed constructive perspectives." the statement concludes. lanjiuji also potentially refers to a figure based on the artwork, created by PC House, which <a href="https://x.com/KetX2L/status/1950099518168432873">someone has linked in the replies</a>. The Ho-Oh art appears to be a commission from the company.</p>
<p>The situation has sparked discussions around Pokémon and its legal terms surrounding fanart — which seemed to suggest that The Pokémon Company owns any publicly shared artwork, and that it doesn't need to notify anyone if the company decides to use it.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/legal/information">legal statement here</a>, but whatever it says, today's decision implies that, while Pokémon <em>could</em> use your art, it wants to avoid doing so.</p>
<p>So, while we wait for the art to be replaced, let's have a look at that placeholder art, then:</p>

<p>Well, at least people are having fun with the temporary cards...! Alongside the new expansion, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week">huge overhaul to trading too</a>, which is a bit of a boon given how much it was criticised when it first dropped.</p>
<p><em>Have you been following this situation? Are you diving into the new expansion today? Let us know down below.</em></p>

<figure><a title="Yomawari" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4627021c6556/yomawari.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're all on tenterhooks awaiting news of a Nintendo Direct that may never arrive, and publisher NIS has only upped the speculation after it accidentally lifted the lid on a new Switch 2 game before swiftly deleting the announcement post.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1md0f07/nis_announced_a_new_2026_game_for_ns2nswps5pc/">Reddit</a> forum by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joseki100/">Joseki100</a>, the Japanese NIS Twitter account was briefly home to the reveal of a new farming game in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yomawari_the_long_night_collection">Yomawari</a> series, accompanied by a 30th July 2026 release date. The post was swiftly removed, but not before more than a handful of people had nabbed a screenshot (you'll find it below, shared to BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/knoebel.bsky.social">Knoebel</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Running the reveal through Google Translate, this one appears to be called '<strong>The Garden of Honolulu</strong>', and seemingly boasts the same chibi art style as we'd expect from a Yomawari game. Naturally, we won't know anything for sure until the game is revealed properly (as in, for more than a few minutes), but hey, at least the key art looks cute.</p>

<p>Now, as many have pointed out on Reddit, the game does <em>feel</em> like a Direct announcement, one that was potentially scheduled too early and accidentally let slip before anything was made official. There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumblings of a July presentation</a> for a good few weeks now, and there are only two days left to fit in that window, so don your tinfoil hat as you will.</p>
<p>Whether it ends up being a sign of an upcoming Direct or not, it looks like we'll have another cute farming sim on our hands next summer. You can never have too many of those, right?</p>
