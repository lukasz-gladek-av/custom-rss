<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161128/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>After hopping into my 20th Hyperspace in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>’s DLC, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, I realised something. I’ve been doing the same things over and over again for the past few hours.</p>
<p>Now, I know the series isn’t exactly known for varying things, but it feels particularly egregious within a condensed DLC experience. And for the entire 10-15 hours I’ve spent running around these Hyperspace pockets, I can probably count on one hand what I’ve done.</p>
<p>This is a pretty chunky DLC in Pokémon terms — the main story can probably be beaten in around 6-8 hours, but there are a lot of new Pokémon, new Side Missions, and more to dig into, including after the credits — but the bulk of Mega Dimension feels like empty calories. Here I am, back in Lumiose City, a place I already got bored with fast because of its lack of variety, and now I’m running around the same handful of randomly-generated Hyperspace pockets over and over again just to fulfil research tasks and progress the story.</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right: randomly-generated. Mega Dimension is <em>sort of</em> a roguelite, and that stopped me from completely sleepwalking my way through every single dimension. For what the liminal pearly white snapshots of Lumiose City lack in variety, they make up for in a handful of other ways. They’re home to an abundance of new returning creatures. Not only that, the ‘mons in these spaces are all over level 100, with many reaching way beyond 150 in the later stages.</p>
<p>I’ve grown up with this franchise, and if you think I don’t still get excited whenever I see a Cubone running around carefree or even newer ‘mons like Sandygast bobbing around in the concrete, then I’m sorry. It’s especially exciting to see these Pokémon at levels way beyond the level cap. Who knew a gang of level 120 Mankey would be lethal? I watched six of them beat up my Feraligatr in no time at all. I got the same level of thrill encountering Alpha Pokémon in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> whenever I jumped into a level 180 dimension and found something I hadn’t caught before.</p>

<p>The higher levels in these dimensions is easily the best thing about this DLC. It makes catching wild Pokémon fun in a different way; no longer am I guaranteed to get something <em>just</em> because it’s a Meditite or a Sandile. It might beat me and my Pokémon up before I get a chance to weaken it a little or sneak up on it. In fact, I found the compact corridors and rooftops of Lumiose worked to the DLC’s advantage, because I had to be a little more thoughtful about how to catch things here than in the base game’s Wild Zones.</p>
<p>Catching Pokémon and dealing with high-level monsters are the highs; the lows are the repetitive maps, the annoying platforming, and the list of random tasks that you complete to build up research points. The grind only gets longer the further in you get.</p>
<p>There’s nothing compelling about awkwardly floating from one rooftop to another, or scrambling around to find the right ladder to get to the top of the building you’re aiming for. Destroying boulders, watering down sludge, picking up items, breaking Poké Balls, catching ‘mons I already have 10 of in my box, or fighting trainers à la the Z-A Royale. It’s all the same stuff in the same spaces I’ve spent hours and hours running around a few months ago.</p>

<p>These alternate pockets of Lumiose City exacerbate all of my problems with the city in the base game. The city lacks character, and in these spaces, it’s all just a blank slate of whiteness. There’s no real way to jump, meaning you have to drop and float and hope you land in the right spot. They’re a chore to get around, with no map and a time limit determined by the type of donut you feed Hoopa before jumping in. And there’s maybe only about six variations of these spaces. When I’m excited to see a sewer, of all places, you know something’s up.</p>
<p>The aforementioned donut making could be cute, and initially, it kind of is – Hoopa and new character Ansha are a delightful pair, and who doesn’t like donuts? But like exploring Hyperspace, baking is a chore. Using berries from the base game (and eventually, Hyper berries), you make donuts that determine how much you increase your Pokémon’s levels and the amount of time you can spend in Hyperspace, depending on the dimension’s star rank <em>and</em> the donut’s rank.</p>
<p>You need to make a lot of these, and you can only make one at a time. It’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> crafting all over again. Weirdly, there’s an option to make the exact same donut you just made, but if your Coba-flavoured confection was a test and you know how to make it better, have fun making one at a time over and over again. And if you don't have any great donuts available, well, get ready to run around the city or Hyperspace or buy them one by one from a vendor.</p>

<p>Luckily, what <em>is</em> great about the base game is still great here. The action-oriented combat is still largely excellent, perhaps let down by some of the chaotic forced double battles peppered throughout the story. The Rogue Mega Evolution fights are actually even better in Mega Dimension, because your foe actually moves around and engages with the space. I even lost to one of them because I jumped in unprepared and was shocked at just how fast it moved and how hard it hit.</p>
<p>When you’re fighting something that matches your level, or something that exceeds it, things get nail-biting, a scramble of defensive choices, Pokémon-swapping, and dodging. But when the DLC basically requires you to be level 100 in the first few hours, but <em>still</em> throws mandatory trainer fights at level 70 your way, it’s a little baffling.</p>
<p>The repetitiveness of Mega Dimension really does let the DLC down because, like with Legends: Z-A, there are some really good foundations here. A Pokémon roguelite could work really well, but there’s little variety to take much advantage of the randomness, besides the Pokémon you encounter.</p>

<p>The combat is great, but give me a set of consistent, high-level fights. Even the Side Missions are a step-up here, for the most part, but for every good battle, story of a city struggling with change, or brand new Mega Evolution encounter, there’s another fetch quest or “trail the Pokémon” task.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The core of Pokémon and the highs of Pokémon Legends: Z-A just about manage to shine through in the Mega Dimension DLC, but the repetitive Hyperspace dimensions, bland level design, and dull donut making stop this from being a true Mega Evolution for the game.</p>
<p>If you’ve grown up with this series, you’ll find it hard to resist the lure of the expanded Pokédex and seeing your favourites almost looking their best is a joy. Repetition is not freeing, though, and as with the base game, I’m missing the freedom of the core series again.</p></section>

<p>"the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During The Game Awards, Capcom finally confirmed the existence of Leon Kennedy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> with an awesome new trailer. It seemingly confirms that players will experience more traditional survival horror while playing as Grace Ashcroft, while Leon's gameplay will be more akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>But will the campaign be skewed in favour of one character over the other? According to Capcom, no. In speaking with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, director Kōshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa confirm that Leon and Grace will share almost equal screen time throughout Requiem.</p>
<p>In fact, Nakanishi compared the structure to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>, during which players jumped between Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield (funnily enough, this, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</a>, was also directed by Nakanishi).</p>
<p>Here's how Nakanishi describes the two play styles with Leon and Grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ve said before that Leon isn’t well suited to horror. Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don’t fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace’s sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We’re really emphasising the difference in their experiences this time.</p>
<p>"It’s almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna (laughs). It was important to combine the slow and fast segments well, and Grace and Leon turned out to be the best combination for that. Leon also has lots of new actions, giving you a strong sense of release compared to Grace’s sequences."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The director also explicitly states that Grace's gameplay is based specifically on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a>, while Leon's is based on Resident Evil 4. By including two distinct styles, the development team is hoping to relieve some of the terror players might feel when playing as Grace by allowing Leon to be the badass we know he is.</p>
<p>That said, Nakanishi is also keen to stress just how much weight Leon is carrying on his shoulders now that he's an older protagonist. He specifically mentions the idea of Leon returning to Raccoon City and responding to the "place where it all began" now that he's a lot more experienced.</p>
<p>This all sounds pretty great to us, and we can't wait to see how things pan out when Requiem launches on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
