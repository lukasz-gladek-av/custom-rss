<p>Nintendo recently kicked off Mario's 40th anniversary, and it appears other companies are joining in on the celebrations.</p>
<p>One of them happens to be First 4 Figures, with the "high end" collectible maker announcing its Mario and Yoshi statue (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/03/pre-orders_for_mario_and_yoshi_statue_go_live_on_first_4_figures_website">which we previously covered here on Nintendo Life</a>) is now back in production - with standard, exclusive and definitive editions available to pre-order.</p>
<p>The definitive edition also comes with the bonus Bowser Checkpoint Flag and is priced at $749.99 / £558.03. The standard edition starts at $549.99 / £409.22, and the exclusive edition will set you back $599.99 / £446.42. There's also an early bird special if you place an order before 13th October 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Calling all Super Mario fans! We're thrilled to announce that we will be heading back into production to complete the edition size of our Mario and Yoshi statue, featuring the Standard, Exclusive, and Definitive versions!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250930.html">official press release</a>, Nintendo Singapore was established last week on 26th September 2025. It aims to accelerate the growth of the company's business in Southeast Asia and will be led by managing director Takahiro Miura. Here's the announcement and overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Co., Ltd.

<p>The same announcement also mentions how Nintendo is considering establishing a local entity in the Kingdom of Thailand to accelerate business in this location. Earlier this year, Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">set up a new subsidiary</a> located in Taiwan, including the launch of the Nintendo eShop in this location.</p>
<p>This follows the launch of the Switch 2 in June, with sales of the new system already off to a flying start. In less than a week, the unit sold over 3.5 million units worldwide, and as of the end of the first month, the device had already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">sold more than 6 million units</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the focus is on "stability improvements" to make the new and old hybrid hardware super stable. Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h3>Ver. 20.5.0 (Released September 29, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qvyjkg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1972886876018123087">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has shared some insight about this latest update on social media. While the patch notes list the sole change as "stability", there is apparently "some code related to handling accounts and system time" that's been updated (<a href="https://switchbrew.org/wiki/20.5.0">via SwitchBrew</a>). As for Switch 2, there are no additional details about these patch notes right now, but according to the same source, there could still be some compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles.</p>
<p>If we find out anything else about this latest update (or if there are any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/more-switch-games-have-received-switch-2-compatibility-fixes">compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles</a>, similar to the previous update), we'll let you know. This follows an update at the start of this month, which also included stability improvements. Nintendo released multiple stability fixes in July and earlier in June as well.</p>
<p>To manually perform this latest system update, navigate to System Settings &gt; System Update &gt; and from there you should be able to download and update your system. Nintendo also updated its music app today, adding a new track from Princess Peach's Switch outing.</p>

<p>Joining Dr. Eggman early next year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> is getting Sega Villains Stage DLC next year, which will see Joe Musashi face off against classic bad guys from past releases.</p>
<p>In August, we found out Sonic's Dr. Eggman would be first up, and now Sega and Lizardcube have lifted the lid on the second character. It's Death Adder - the fearsome giant from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/golden_axe">Golden Axe</a> series. Here's a teaser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The katana verses the axe. Joe Musashi will face off against another classic SEGA Villain – Death Adder, the fearsome giant from the Golden Axe series. Play against him, Dr Eggman and another mysterious villain in the SEGA Villains Stage DLC for SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned, these two villains will be joined by one other mysterious guest villain. And they're scheduled to land in early 2026. This reveal follows last week's game update. This particular patch improved the Nintendo Switch resolution and also addressed some bugs.</p>
