<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fde7eddc2247/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, Level-5 announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> would be treated to a Photo Mode in an upcoming July update. Rather unsurprisingly — given that today is the 31st July and all — the dev has revealed that the update has been pushed back to <em>next</em> month, but this is no bad thing, because it looks like it's going to be a big one.</p>
<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250731/">Fantasy Life website</a>, Level-5 states that it is "currently working to deliver multiple new features in a single update," so ver. 1.5.0 will be much more than a photo op. The dev then goes on to outline some of the upcoming features, revealing that mounts will be getting an overhaul (hello, climbing and double jumps!), a new camera angle will be added, and you'll be able to switch up your party formation on the fly with a new Weird Pad option.</p>
<p>We imagine that there will be more than this added in the next update, but for now, here's a little more detail on the above features that will accompany Photo Mode in ver. 1.5.0.</p>
<h2>Fantasy Life i ver. 1.5.0 (Coming August 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Mount Performance Enhancements<br>
Dash speed will be increased, and mounts will be able to perform double jumps and climb cliffs.</strong></h3>
<p>You'll be able to ride mounts at a higher speed, and double jump will also be unlocked.<br>
In addition, a new feature will allow you to climb cliffs while remaining mounted.</p>
<h3><strong>New Camera Feature for Distant View at Base Camp<br>
New craftable objects will also be added.</strong></h3>
<p>The camera's movement range within your base camp will be expanded, allowing you to see farther into the distance.<br>
New craftable objects are also planned to be added.</p>
<h3><strong>Party Formation Management via the Weird Pad<br>
A new option will also allow you to remove players during multiplayer.</strong></h3>
<p>By using the Weird Pad, you'll be able to change your party's formation at any time.<br>
A new planned feature also lets you remove players during multiplayer sessions.</p>

That sub-header quote from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hitman_absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> has made us sad now. Poor Agent 47. It must be lonely being an insane psychopath who spends his time flying around the world, looking cool, getting free clobber, and offing folk in trendy nightclubs.</p>
<p>However, chin up, baldy, as we've got some good news that involves you: Feral Interactive has just announced that Hitman Absolution is coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 in late 2025 and TBC 2026, respectively.</p>
<p>This follows on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> alongside the Switch 2 back in June.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067syltij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here are some more early details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hitman Absolution features all the series’ hallmarks of stealth, distraction and disguise, while revealing 47 as a more complicated and thoughtful character, aware of the effects of his actions, for both good and evil.</p>
<p><em>Absolution</em>’s missions invite players to explore and experiment as they stalk their targets, engineering opportunities to strike from the shadows or, when the bullets fly, unleashing an arsenal of weapons, gadgets and anything else that may come to hand. Whether executing a silent hit or creating mayhem, players have no end of inventive ways to approach their targets, with opportunities to beat their high scores and meet each mission’s multiple Challenges."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think it's fair to say that Absolution was <em>quite divisive</em> amongst critics when it launched back in 2012, and for what it's worth, this writer did initially kind of hate it when it came out. It was just so far removed from the vibe and style of a 'proper' Hitman, it really didn't hit well.</p>
<p>However! It has to be said that a replay a year or two later, away from the excitement and noise of release week, well, it's a fine enough action game if you just take it on its own terms, really.</p>
<p>The game is also coming to iOS and Android, and Feral says that more details on the Switch versions will be coming "later this year". We'll keep you updated on this one as we find out more.</p>

<p>Based on real dreams?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Mexican indie studio Interactive Dreams has announced that its short interactive story, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/a_dream_about_parking_lots">A Dream About Parking Lots</a>, arrives on Nintendo Switch... today.</p>
<p>The game, which only takes around 30-40 minutes to complete according to the PR, sees you search for your car, whilst at the same time having a conversation with a therapist about why you have this recurring dream about parking lots.</p>
<p>It may be short, but when indies hone in on something mighty specific in a laser-focused way like this — and especially when the writing is up to scratch — special things can occur. And, given this one is currently sat on a "Positive" user rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3500340/A_Dream_About_Parking_Lots/">over on Steam</a>, where it released back in March, it seems it might pack some big messages into its short running time.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer above, and here's some more from the PR blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Dream About Parking Lots</em> is a short, surreal narrative game where you search for your car in endless parking lots while talking to your therapist about recurring dreams. Blending retro visuals with emotional storytelling, it explores themes of feeling lost, creative block, and the strange logic of dreams 🧠</p>
<p>Look for your car by using your car key!<br>
30-40 minutes long.<br>
Retro-style graphics.<br>
Existential story about feeling lost and creative blocks.<br>
Based on real dreams!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can't find details on pricing, as it's not yet showing up on the eShop, but it's $3.99 on <a href="https://interactivedreams.itch.io/adreamaboutparkinglots">itch.io</a> and Steam. It's 699 yen <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000101018">on the Japanese eShop</a>, although there's a 20% launch discount right now that brings it down to 559 yen.</p>
<p><em>Looking forward to having therapy in a car park that may or may not exist?</em></p>
