<p>That really is updating the world</p>

<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time Hunter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c49a7337e494/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-hunter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Just under a month ago, Level-5 revealed that it would be releasing free DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which has been a huge success for the Japanese developer. The game has sold over 1 million copies across all platforms, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 version in particular is absolutely fantastic</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the developer has <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">shared more details</a> about that upcoming free DLC, <strong>Update the World</strong>, and it really is updating the world, as Ginormosia will be transforming into a base for a roguelike, open world adventure (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-update-the-world-to-add-new-mode-roguelike-open-world">Gematsu</a>!). A date hasn't been announced, but Level-5 is aiming to bring it to fans "as soon as possible."</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179kjoguq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Alongside this massive-sounding mode, more powerful gear, new equipment, new mounts, some strange new items, and additional emotes and hairstyles will be coming. But, most importantly, look at this fuzzy new character who will play an important role in the DLC. Is he good? Is he bad? We don't care — he's got a very fluffy mane!</p>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time DLC Character" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eae014d763176/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-dlc-character.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Level-5 promises that, for as big as the world sounds, the upcoming DLC will offer "engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." Well, the base game already does that, so Level-5 will be stealing more of our time in the near future.</p>
<p>We're delighted to see how successful and popular Fantasy Life i has become, and the Switch and Switch 2 versions are now totally up to date with other consoles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-scores-another-switch-1-and-2-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">as of today's free update</a>. Between this and Mario Kart World, we're never going to have time for anything else, are we?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition-a-fantastic-little-upgrade.1223019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I absolutely adored the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fantasy_life">Fantasy Life</a> on the 3DS, and thankfully, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has proven to be a worthy successor, sinking its claws into me all over again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Kate Gray reviewed the Switch 1 version</a> and said, “It's beautiful, it's robust, it's got multiplayer, it's got three fully-fleshed-out areas to explore, it's got crafting and foraging and cooking and fishing and minigames and beautiful music and sidequests and more. And it's all really, really good.”</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182726 @ 1750338004 -->
<p>Well said, Kate, and I wholeheartedly agree. It's one of those wonderfully addictive games where there's so much to do, so much to see, and all the numbers go up and up making you feel really good about your progress. You could argue that it does little to meaningfully evolve the gameplay from the 3DS original, but when it's this good, I'm really not that fussed.</p>
<p>So it’s great news, then, that the Switch 2 version makes the overall experience even more enjoyable thanks to a small batch of noteworthy improvements to the presentation. We’re mainly talking about resolution and frame rate here, so don’t expect any fancy mouse controls or HD Rumble 2 or tie-ins to a mobile app.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i admittedly looked pretty nice and performed reasonably well on Switch 1 at around 30fps. That said, the significant bump up to 60fps on Switch 2 is very welcome and I can’t imagine going back now. It doesn’t <em>always</em> hit its target, particularly in the larger open-world environments, but I didn't get anything more serious than a few minor dips here and there.</p>
<p>Similarly, the visuals are much crisper than before, especially noticeable when playing in handheld mode. The blur effect is still in place around the edges of the screen, but it feels slightly toned down to allow the game’s world to shine brighter than ever. You can turn this off completely, if you wish, but I find the focus blur adds to the charm; kinda like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link’s Awakening</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>
<p>A small patch applied shortly after release also boosts shadow quality and the object render distance; a minor improvement, but one that further widens the gap between the versions. Load times were acceptable on Switch 1, averaging between 5 and 10 seconds, but this has been cut down significantly to 3 or 4 seconds for most scenarios.</p>
<p>Given how cheap the upgrade is for Switch 1 owners — you’re looking at £2.04 / $2.59 / €2.27 or your regional equivalent — the performance improvements for Fantasy Life i on Switch 2 are more than worth the price of admission. Other publishers have the gall to charge full price again (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">looking at you, Sega</a>), but this is an acceptable middle ground. If you’re keen on trying out Level-5’s long-awaited sequel, this is absolutely the best way to play on Nintendo systems.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hideo Kojima has been out and about and doing interviews at the Sydney Film Festival as part of the build-up to the release of his upcoming, Australian-set sequel, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/i-almost-gave-up-hideo-kojima-on-looking-into-the-abyss-death-stranding-2s-australian-setting-working-with-his-idols-and-connecting-with-koalas/">GamesRadar</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> director openly chatted about a whole bunch of topics, including one rather cool Game Boy Advance title by Konami that he produced back in 2003. During the conversation, as he discusses his creative spark and how eureka moments come about, he mentions <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/boktai_the_sun_is_in_your_hand">Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand</a> as an example of his interest in infusing game experiences with new tech.</p><p><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97frziwuq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Indeed, with this in mind, Kojima gave an example of how Konami's toy division once manufactured a UV-light-detecting teddy bear (just what we've always wanted!). It failed to gain any traction, for some reason, and so, with Konami sitting on a load of unused components, Kojima pounced, striking a deal on the UV-sensor tech on the cheap to incorporate into the Boktai cartridges so that the game could detect actual real sunlight and charge up your in-game weapon to kill vampires. Pretty rad, right?</p>
<p>"UV sensors were so expensive at the time," he said. "You have to select the ideas at the best time."</p>

<p>And so it proved, as Boktai released to cracking reviews, and sits on a rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/boktai-the-sun-is-in-your-hand/">83% over at Metacritic</a>, which is actually 1% more than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, so maybe someone should look at sticking some UV tech into the sequel, eh.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> is out now on Switch and Switch 2, and we thought it was really rather good. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">9/10 review of the Switch 1 version</a>, we said it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well," praising the sheer amount of compelling stuff to do alongside the "edgy and dramatic" story.</p>
<p>The kind folks over at Marvelous have sent us the physical Limited Edition of the Switch 1 game to check out, and we thought you might like to see exactly what's included in this edition. So we've put together a cheeky little gallery to peruse at your leisure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xosjtg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>What's included, exactly? Well, the star of the show is a rather beautiful Sacred Fan with an accompanying clear display stand. You've also got a Woolby Plush Keychain, a 161-page softback art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD, and the game itself on cartridge.</p>
<p>Definitely some high-quality goodies, and we're particularly enamoured with the art book – it's chock-full of character designs and environment paintings. Gorgeous stuff. Let's take a closer look.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition is still available and priced at <strong>£79.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US (if you can find one). A proper physical edition for the Switch 2 (i.e. not a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a>) is also available for <strong>£59.99 / $69.99</strong> (or alternatively you can opt for the upgrade pack for <strong>£10 / $10</strong> if you already have the Switch 1 version).</p>
