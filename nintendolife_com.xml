<p>Squad up, Switch 2 style!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>EA has just announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> will be receiving a Switch 2 upgrade next month, or rather next week, as it drops on August 5th. Hooray!</p>
<p>Yep, as part of today's very good/middling/awful (delete as appropriate) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/watch-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-live">Partner Direct</a>, we learned that the online squad-based shooter, which first launched all the way back in 2019 — when it singlehandedly invented pinging stuff for your mates in-game (maybe) — will hit Switch 2 next Tuesday.</p>
<p>It came to the original Switch in 2021, although it's far from the best place to ply it. The Switch 2 version will boast an enhanced resolution and better performance, according to the trailer, which you can check out above.</p>
<p>Of course, this dickied-up new version will also be released to coincide with the start of the game's 26th season of online murdering. How time flies!</p>

<p>Introducing, Elliot</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase was closed out by a pair of announcements from Square Enix: <strong>Octopath Traveler 0</strong>, and an all-new action RPG called <strong>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</strong>.</p>
<p>This is yet another HD-2D joint, which will see you playing as 'Elliot, the Adventurer' (badass name, that), who sets out across the fantasy land of Philabieldia to keep his kingdom safe.</p>
<p>Action seems to really be at the heart of this one, with seven weapon types at Elliot's disposal to take on foes and safely make it through the environment. You can even team up with a pal in co-op mode, and split your combat duties between the titular hero and his fairy companion, Faie.</p>
<p>We still don't have a precise release date for this one just yet outside of the '<strong>2026</strong>' window, though Square Enix did announce that a free demo will be available later today, with a player feedback survey coming shortly after.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Have you also forgotten the title already? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

<p>Kiwami 1 also getting a Switch 2 release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Kazuma Kiryu's story will continue on Switch 2 later this year as <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 2</strong> releases on 13th November 2025.</p>
<p>Continuing the story on from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> — a remake of the first Yakuza game that received a Switch port last year — Kiryu will be facing off against the Dragon of Kansai, Ryuji Goda.</p>
<p>Featuring improved combat and set in both Kamurocho and Sotenbori, this seems to be more of a straight port compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, which was a Switch 2 launch title. We're not complaining! Plus, we can play darts, karaoke, and golf.</p>


<p>If you haven't yet played the first Kiwami, you're in luck — Yakuza Kiwami is also coming to Switch 2! Plus, if you already own Yakuza Kiwami on Switch, you'll be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 version at a discounted price.</p>

<p>Still aiming for Winter</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo and Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> made a surprise appearance during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and while we still don't have a release date (This Winter is all we have), we did get a new trailer.</p>
<p>Largely a story-setting showcase, the trailer gives us a look at many of the game's playable characters, while re-establishing that yes, this is a canonical story that showcases the Imprisoning War.</p>
<p>Plus, it looks like we're getting a brand new Construct to play around with.</p>

<p>Very few other details were shared, so this trailer — and the reveal back in April — are all we have to go on right now. Still, we're looking forward to checking out what Zelda was up to during the Imprisoning War, and to better understanding what happened in the run-up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
