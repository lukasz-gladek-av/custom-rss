<p>In sickness and in stealth</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>While Kojima fans on Switch might be feeling a little left out with all the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a> buzz, not to mention the lack of 60fps options in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a> (we've still got our fingers crossed for a Switch 2 update), it seems like Rainy Frog and the one-person dev Rainy Night Creations might have a little something to help scratch your itch. As long as you're looking for retro-styled stealth, that is; Dollman lovers won't find what they're looking for here. Probably.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spy_drops">Spy Drops</a> isn't shy about showing love for its stealth-action influences, that's for sure. Coming to Switch (and Steam) on 31st July, the game's story features the requisite elements of shadowy operations and shady operatives. The plot apparently unravels through randomised missions that feature PS1-style visuals and gameplay that is very explicitly channelling the escapades of one Solid Snake.</p>
<p>It seems you'll get plenty of familiar spy tech — night vision goggles, drones, grenades — you know, the essentials. The PR blurb also mentions a "Dream Catcher," which you can use to "infiltrate the minds of soldiers and discover the locations of the next targets." As you do.</p>
<p>Beyond the gameplay, one aspect definitely worth noting is that the character designs in this one have been handled by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/companies/artepiazza">ArtePiazza</a>, the Japanese developer with a rich history with Square Enix and the <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> series, and who most recently worked on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a> Switch remake.</p>
<p>The trailer above gives you a great idea of just how authentic-feeling the game's looking compared to the late-'90s classics it's aping. Here are a few screens and some more details from the press release:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A story that takes a turn….</strong><br>
As your mission unfolds, so does the truth behind it. What was believed to be a world-saving op in stopping a global threat quickly spirals into something far more sinister. Who can you trust when the people giving you the orders are hiding behind the biggest lie and conspiracy?<br>
-<strong>Forever replayable:</strong> experience randomly generated missions, letting you enjoy a fresh story and new challenges every time you play.<br>
- <strong>Dynamic Gameplay:</strong> from map layouts to enemy placements, no two missions are alike. Even the weather and time of day will keep you on your toes!<br>
- <strong>Stealth with Style:</strong> upgrade your character, master new stealth skills, and become the ultimate spy.<br>
- <strong>Spy Against Spy Mode:</strong> take on a friend in a head-to-head local multiplayer showdown. Who’s the better agent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's tough to tell without getting our hands on it, but it certainly looks the part, and we're intrigued by the mention of spy versus spy local competitive multiplayer, too.</p>
<p>It's out at the end of the month for £13.99/$14.99, so we can only hope that the impeccable visual vibes carry over into Spy Drops' infiltration gameplay. Let us know below if your fancy is piqued.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo 64 NSO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee8c62a476f5c/nintendo-64-nso.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Intrepid fans have been doing some serious detective work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-shares-video-detailing-new-n64-features-for-switch-online">Nintendo's N64 trailer from May</a> and they think they've identified several as-yet-unannounced releases for Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/ImakuniVT/status/1941912231303585925" tabindex="-1">@ImakuniVT</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-think-nintendo-accidentally-revealed-switch-onlines-next-wave-of-n64-games/">VGC</a>), the section of <a href="https://youtu.be/wDNg1pwrTVg?si=uw2fvNYef51CLwwT&amp;t=38">the trailer</a> showing off the app's new CRT filter has the blurred game selection screen shown below the settings screen. Playing around with layers and a little Gaussian Blur, fans have been busy identifying potential games in the background, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros.</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Looking at the post above, you might think that's a stretch, but this reply from <a href="https://x.com/NitroExists/status/1942003844927435200" tabindex="-1">@NitroExists</a> helps illustrate how people have been matching the blurred and dimmed box art from the trailer. Observe:</p>


<p>Now, does this mean all these games are definitely coming to the N64 NSO app? Not necessarily, and despite being convincing, it's also possible the matches aren't 100%. It's <em>also</em> possible the team just added placeholder art for the sake of testing and the person making the trailer assumed that no one would be able to ID the art. Even if these are correct, it still doesn't confirm an official NSO release is on the cards.</p>
<p>However, all of the suggested games are possible. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK64</a>'s arrival to help promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on Switch 2 feels very obvious, and surely it's only a matter of time until Smash Bros. and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Melee</a> end up on the subscription service. Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/glover">Glover</a> may seem unlikely given that it's already available on the Switch eShop, but so is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turok">Turok</a>, and that's playable via NSO.</p>
<p>And happily, Forsaken was one of the games we wished could be added in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/9-mature-games-wed-love-to-see-on-nintendo-switch-onlines-new-n64-app">a feature we worked up last year</a> when the 'Mature' app appeared. We'd love to see that one added, too.</p>
<p><em>Do you think we'll be seeing these games on NSO in the future, near or far? Let us know in the usual place.</em></p>
