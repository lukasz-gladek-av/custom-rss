<p>We thought developers and publishers would be winding down right before the holidays, but <a href="https://x.com/PATAPON__REPLAY/status/2001957426724282697">Bandai Namco has dropped</a> a little teaser for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, the collection of the two classic PSP games, for some brand new content on <strong>22nd December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the teaser gives us nothing but a cute little animation, before capping it off with the news. The update will give us a brand new game mode, with more details to come, giving us the perfect opportunity to dive back in next week.</p>
<p>And hey, if you haven't picked up Patapon 1+2 Replay yet, in the UK it's currently on sale for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/PATAPON-1-2-REPLAY-2804105.html"><strong>$19.99 on the eShop</strong></a> (until 31st December).</p>
<p>Releasing back in July of this year, Patapon 1+2 Replay bundles together two iconic PSP rhythm action games where you have to command an army of Patapons by beating drums. The key is timing each of your commands to the beat and knowing when it's best to Don or Pata. If you know, you know.</p>
<p>We had a pleasant time with the Switch version of the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">scoring it a 7/10</a>: it's "a real blast from the past and more than proves why this series was such a hit for Sony."</p>

<p>Back on dry land</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It was almost exactly a year ago that we first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a>'s 'In the Jungle' DLC at The Game Awards 2024. We got a brief look at the expansion in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-dlc-swims-onto-switch-in-2026">November Xbox Showcase</a>, but today, developer MINTROCKET has fully lifted the lid on what we can expect.</p>
<p>In a new 'Dev Dive' video, the team gives us our best look yet at the upcoming DLC, which apparently adds roughly 10 hours of gameplay to the already beefy base game.</p>
<p>We get to see the jungle village of Utara, complete with its own real-time day/night cycle, where Dave can converse with the locals, freely dive into the freshwater lake, and gather resources. It still feels a bit strange to see Dave move in a 3D plane, but the whole thing looks really rather sweet. This locale is also home to Bancho's Grill, a new restaurant to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a closer look at Dave's new diving spot, and his fresh transforming 'Jungle Gun' weapon to fend off the beasties therein.</p>

<p>It promises to be quite the expansion when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 at some point next year. MINTROCKET still hasn't shared a precise date, but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more information.</p>
