<p>Going beyond the Mushroom Kingdom</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> arrive on the Switch this October, and Nintendo has now released a new seven-minute overview trailer.</p>
<p>It features another look at the gameplay, the additional content you can expect, as well as the new features added to this updated package. The catch is, the trailer has only been released in Japan, but there's still enough on display to get an idea about what's going on. When an English version of the trailer is released (or a similar trailer is released), we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>You can see our recent coverage of this new package in our previous posts here on Nintendo Life. Nintendo has also announced its next Mario Movie is based on the Super Mario Galaxy universe.</p>

<p>Joining the 'Nintendo Classics' library next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be expanding its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service with two more games for the Game Boy Advance library.</p>
<p>They include the Namco titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mr_driller_2">Mr. Driller 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a>, and they'll be arriving next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>. Here's an official description of both:</p>
<h3>KLONOA™ Empire of Dreams</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The ruler of a distant empire suffers from a serious case of sleepless nights. In his torment, Emperor Jillius passes a law forbidding his loyal subjects from ever dreaming again! One morning, our hero Klonoa and his friend Huepow find themselves in front of the emperor, charged with dreaming of<br>
adventure. As punishment for their crimes, they must defeat the four monsters that plague the lands.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Play as Klonoa and take down enemies with the ever-trusty Wind Bullet. Solve puzzles and collect helpful items like stars as you jump your way through 40 incredible stages! Help Klonoa in his journey to redeem himself and find out just why dreams have become so taboo...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Mr. Driller™2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Join Susumu and Anna as a mysterious outbreak of Blocks threatens the world's existence once more. Armed with a mighty drill, dig deep through multicolored blocks until you reach safety. Not all blocks will be breakable, so be careful that the blocks you break don't cause others to fall on you or cut off your Air Supply! Scramble to grab air capsules for a recharge, and you'll be just fine to reach your goal. How deep can you dig underground? Drill to your heart's content in three modes: Mission Driller, Endless Driller, and Time Attack Driller!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Japan will receive the same two titles next week. Will you be revisiting these games on Nintendo's subscription service? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Coming to Switch platforms later this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of release, Dotemu and Tribute Games have slowly been revealing new playable characters. This week, a new trailer has dropped for Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider. An official description for both of these characters has also been shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"King T’Challa, the Black Panther and stalwart leader of Wakanda, dashes into battle wielding his vibranium-enhanced suit and sonic daggers. With peerless martial arts skills and strength, he’ll pounce on any threat or foe foolish enough to challenge him!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, Cosmic Ghost Rider can’t let that go unpunished. Atop his Hell cycle, this wild incarnation of the Rider roars across the spaceways. Beware: this Spirit of Stellar Vengeance punishes by wielding both hellfire and the Power Cosmic!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the previous character reveals include heroes like Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill, with the rest of the roster made up of Marvel classics like Captain America, some X-Men characters, and Spider-Man.</p>
