<p>Hall effect sticks? Check</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PowerA has launched a new wireless controller for the Switch 2 (with compatibility confirmed for the OG, Lite, and OLED too), boasting features that could give the official Pro Controller a run for its money.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£54.99 / $69.99</strong>, the Advantage Wireless Controller will come in three flavours: Black, Mario &amp; Friends, and Pokémon: Mega Evolutions. It comes with Hall Effect analogue sticks, motion controls, a dedicated C button, mappable back buttons, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, being a third-party pad, you're not going to get <em>everything</em>, so NFC amiibo support isn't here, and it doesn't seem like these controllers will have wake-up support for the Switch 2 either. Still, at £20 less than the $89.99 asking price for the Pro Controller, the monetary saving could potentially make up for these exclusions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>• Hall Effect Modules:</strong> Contact-free magnetic sensors in the thumbsticks provide a more fluid pro-level feel and help with precision and longevity<strong><br>
• Advanced Gaming Buttons:</strong> Get an edge over the competition with mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons you can program on the fly, mid-game—no system settings to configure<strong><br>
• Intuitive Motion Controls:</strong> Get immersed in your games with fluid, responsive motion controls that provide an intuitive way to aim, steer, fly, and more<strong><br>
• C Button:</strong> Easily activate fun GameChat features<strong><br>
• Rechargeable Battery:</strong> Get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. Includes an extra-long 10 ft. USB-C cable to recharge the internal battery*<strong><br>
• Ergonomic Design:</strong> Game for hours with a controller that feels great in your hands, thanks to cutting-edge ergonomics and top-of-the-line materials<strong><br>
• Nintendo Family Compatibility:</strong> Works with the Nintendo Switch system of devices: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and Nintendo Switch Lite<strong><br>
• Officially Licensed:</strong> PowerA products have gone through Nintendo’s rigorous testing and evaluation processes to ensure compatibility with the Nintendo Switch 2 system</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Game launches this month!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (with a brief mention of the OG Switch version at the end), providing more than 6 minutes of information on the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>, Z-A is the sort-of-sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> and takes place in Lumiose City with a revamped real-time battle system. The trailer goes over this along with the character customisation features, photo mode, the 'Z-A Royale Tournament', and more.</p>
<p>If you think the game looks a bit naff visually, you're not alone, and this trailer won't do much to convince you otherwise (though the interiors in 'Hotel Z' look pretty nice, admittedly), but it definitely looks like a pretty neat take on the long-running series nonetheless. We're pretty concerned about how this might look and run on the original Switch, though.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. Some of the new mechanics and modes here sound genuinely interesting, and hopefully this will more than make up for any visual or performance shortcomings.</p>
<p>Legends: Z-A will also offer up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension DLC</a> for <strong>£24.99</strong>, with early adopters receiving apparel sets on day one, with a story expansion arriving at some point before the end of February 2026.</p>

<figure data-uuid="45e366b1f66d0"><a title="Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45e366b1f66d0/super-mario-bros-2-the-lost-levels.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've <em>all</em> heard of Minus World, right? A glitched world in the original 1985 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, it was accessible via World 1-2 and is an infinitely-looping underwater level, similarly designed to World 7-2. It's one of the most legendary glitches in gaming history.</p>
<p>And, it turns out, its direct sequel <em>also</em> has its own Minus World. It's just taken almost 40 years to discover it, and speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA">Kosmic</a> is the one who discovered it (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels-minus-world-levels-found-four-decades-later/">Nintendo Everything</a>!).</p>
<p>In both the Japanese and English releases <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_the_lost_levels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a> (the actual Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan, available officially in the West via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_all-stars">All-Stars</a> bundle on the SNES), various glitched worlds are available, either changing the names, looping screens, or changing enemy behaviour.</p>
<p>However, it's that All-Stars collection where a Minus World is really tucked away, and it's incredibly complex to pull off. You have to first progress through some increasingly-glitched versions of levels; the idea is Kosmic is trying to get past B-8, but reaching B-7 the first time, he realised it was impossible to beat.</p>
<p>Saving, quitting, and reloading brought him back to a completely different level layout, but it allowed him to get past those impassable glitches and roadblocks. A glitched warp pipe (with part of a coin above it) in B-9 brought Kosmic back to World 1-1, but this didn't deter him.</p>

<p>Continuing to progress through glitched worlds until he reaches World B-D and, eventually, various glitched menu options. It's a lot easier to watch than read us explain it, so make sure you watch Kosmic's new video above to see just how <em>wild</em> some of these glitches get.</p>
<p>So, why did this take so long? Kosmic mentions that difficulty is probably the main reason, but he also believes that, because this glitch requires you to make much more progress in-game, and wasn't played by as many people, there's just lower interest in general.</p>
<p>Well, we're glad that someone was willing to dig deep into the glitch worlds of The Lost Levels, and it's a pretty amazing discovery after nearly 40 years.</p>

<figure data-uuid="24d4066719a76"><a title="&quot;OpenAI Is Trying To Get Sued&quot; - Nintendo IP Floods Sora 2 Video Generation App 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24d4066719a76/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: OpenAI / Sora 2</em></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI recently released its dedicated Sora App, which is being pitched as a rival to TikTok and Instagram, with the key difference being that all the videos are generated via the <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">Sora 2 video generation model.</a></p>
<p>As is the case with many of these Generative AI tools, Sora 2 has been trained on millions of hours of human-made footage which already exists online, almost always without permission – and that includes copyrighted material created by the likes of Sega, Nintendo and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Sora 2 has only been available for a day or so, and most social network feeds are already flooded with videos generated using the tool, many of which blatantly steal intellectual property, including Nintendo's.</p>
<p>This fact hasn't been lost on the many people on social media.</p>




<p>It's not just Nintendo's IP which is being infringed here; <strong>Sonic</strong> appears in many Sora 2-generated videos, too.</p>

<p>OpenAI has previously stated that it has adopted an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-new-sora-video-generator-require-copyright-holders-opt-out-wsj-reports-2025-09-29/">'opt-out' policy regarding IP</a> – that means IP owners need to contact OpenAI to have their IP removed from the Sora 2 training database. Critics argue that it's basically the equivalent of robbing a bank and only returning the money when you're told it's not yours.</p>

<p>It's not just the world of video games which is being replicated here without permission; anime and movies are also being reproduced, thanks to the fact that advanced video models like this are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright">betraying their training data with more accuracy</a> than ever before.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the notoriously litigious Nintendo will take this lying down, but many AI sceptics are predicting legal action from multiple IP owners in response to Sora 2's flood of cloned material. Last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-is-reportedly-targeting-ai-generated-mario-pictures">takedowns were filed</a> against AI-generated images featuring Mario and other Nintendo characters.</p>
<p>Generative AI is a hot topic in the world of video games these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">with a recent report claiming that over half of Japanese developers are using AI in some form</a>. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">maintained</a> that it won't be making use of the controversial technology, at least for the time being.</p>
