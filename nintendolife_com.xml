            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It was the Christmas of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/svcznf9cxtY?si=XFI81dUw7IU_LgNC">Mr Blobby</a> was the funniest thing on television (according to your parents), and <a href="https://youtu.be/3JWTaaS7LdU?si=X88fExf5WKFM4q0D">Whitney Houston</a> had been tricked into singing a love song about everyone's favourite sentient cardigan, Kevin Costner (I feel like I'm having a war flashback now).</p>
<p>And me? Well, I was having a great time despite all of this, actually. Because Santa had done me a massive solid.</p>
<p>Now, two things. Firstly, Santa hadn't done a toilet in my lounge. That's not what I mean at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I was 14 years old in 1992, so I shouldn't have been asking my bewildered and frightened parents (Mr Blobby-loving fools) to send a rather bullish letter to the North Pole requesting — demanding — a Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<p>With the arrival of this tour-de-force into to the sitting room of my Dickensian home on 25th December 1992, I, for the first time ever, was experiencing graphical and gameplay parity (<a href="https://youtu.be/BiufDI8cBkU?si=8WK4Z9utZUC-3ee2">after a lot of trying on my beloved Commodore 64</a>) with the local arcade version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">The World Warrior</a>, where I had previously been spending all the money I could steal from my Mr Blobby-loving dad to feed my addiction to Eddie Honda's big shiny chest. (Don't worry, I never paid him back.)</p>

<p>This was my first Nintendo console! My first console of any kind that was mine, in fact, and as a result of this, and because it was the first game that really made me feel as though the home experience could indeed match the flashy side of the arcade one, Street Fighter 2 has — and always will have — a very special place in my heart. It was a bonus, really, that it was also phenomenal to play as well as to sit and stare at.</p>
<p>In a way that it's hard to convey today, when we're drowning in deep and meaningful gaming experiences, and when gamers have grown up with home consoles that give them the best of everything at their fingertips, Street Fighter 2 awakened me to the possibility that, for me, gaming might not, like a puppy for example, be just for Christmas.</p>
<p>And this is the serious bit, the 'science bit' if you will. Because I grew up in a time and place that happened entirely before the internet (and possibly before Jesus, but that's another Christmas story for another Christmastime), it was very easy to feel cut off and left behind in matters technologic. Such was life in rural '80s and '90s Ireland; lots of cow s**t, not so much of the latest high street cool s**t.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3cc5bfd3621c5"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3cc5bfd3621c5/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Street Fighter 2, though, with those fancy arcade-perfect graphics and noises and music, well, that was what everyone who knew anything was playing and talking about that particular year's end (in my young mind), and I was now playing and talking about it, too. Mostly to myself, but you can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>It seems like nothing, and it is! But that little glimmer of feeling as though I was involved was, for a wee guy who was yet to meet any other real-world gaming pals, and for someone who lived quite remotely, it was a big deal to be riding the latest wave of excitement. You couldn't just hit someone up in their DMs back then, y'know. Connections hit different.</p>
<p>And so, because I'm a legit saddo (as you'll now know and understand), every Christmas <em>to this very day</em> I still boot up the old Street Fighter 2 on my SNES (not my OG machine, unfortunately) and dig into one or two runs of its fabulous arcade mode. It's a game that's never aged in my mind; it looks as good as it ever did in its detailed pugilists, atmospheric environments and delightful little background animations. And complaints about the awful frame rate will get you banned from my Xmas party punch bowl, I'm afraid.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fcb98f3984af0"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fcb98f3984af0/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It ties a bow on my festive period, it drowns me in just right volume of intoxicating nostalgia, and it reminds me of more innocent times. All of that guff.</p>
<p>But it also marks a point where I remember vividly having shifted from loving games and playing games for what they were to wanting to keep them in my life as a thing that helped me connect and feel connected. And I guess that's what I'm still doing to this day.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to show my sons how red and trembly my face goes when I can't reliably pull off Vega's wall dive. Merry Christmas and that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> was, coincidentally, one of 2022's <em>sleeper</em> hits.

<p>It will come as no surprise, then, that we were rather excited to see a sequel on the way. Announced in June 2023 and confirmed to be coming to Switch at the June 2024 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/tabletop-inspired-rpg-citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-gets-january-release">PC Gaming Showcase</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> promises more of the same deep space dilemmas, but with an expanded dice system, clean-cut job roles and multiple environments to explore, we were keen to learn more about its new recruits before liftoff.</p>
<p>Sitting for a chat with Gareth Damian Martin (of the game's one-person team, Jump Over The Age), we aimed to do just that. Our conversation covered an intergalactic range of topics, including the pressure of making a sequel, the game's TTRPG roots and their plans for the future.</p>
<p>So, don your space suits and buckle up, Sleeper, it's time to talk spaaaaace...</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Citizen Sleeper was a huge success back in 2022, but you’ve said in the past that a sequel wasn’t the natural next project for you. What was it that made you want to come back to this universe for Citizen Sleeper 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gareth Damian Martin, Jump Over The Age:</strong> I’m a big fan of making experimental projects, and inventing new designs within games, which means a sequel isn’t always my first instinct. But with Citizen Sleeper, I felt there was still so much more of the experiment to do! The first game was fairly modest in terms of system and scale, so it left plenty of space for new systems and ideas. In particular, I’m a big fan of “ship and crew” sci-fi series like <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> and <strong>Farscape,</strong> but I have always felt games never quite got the genre right. So it was exciting to try to make one of these stories within the Citizen Sleeper universe, which I felt was ideally suited to this kind of storytelling.</p>
<p>In the end, I felt like there was an opportunity to build on the first game while also offering something equally fresh and different so that the two games could sit alongside each other as a pair.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2246b1082effe"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2246b1082effe/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2, like its predecessor, is about a lot of different things: capitalism, humanity, survival, loneliness, etc. What are the biggest challenges of balancing so many themes when it comes to writing a story like this?</strong></p>
<p>I have to be honest, I don’t really write “thematically” when I’m telling a story. I’m not really focused on making statements. Instead, I am very interested in my characters and the different paths they can take through the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I start writing, I often have a lot of situations in my mind that feel interesting or exciting. I might have an idea for a contract where you instigate a mutiny on a ship in the middle of a general strike or an idea for a group of characters who are all pursuing the same long-lost interstellar drive. I select and invent these based on my own interests, so the reason Citizen Sleeper has these themes is because that’s what interests me in the world! That’s when I really set up the subjects of the story, and from that point on, my mind is focused on who the characters are, how they speak, how the world works, and what might make for a compelling plot.</p>
<p>Some stories are compelling because they are tense and pacy, others because they are introspective and heartfelt. For me, the beauty of Citizen Sleeper is that the game can contain all these atmospheres and stories at once, so I don’t worry too much about balancing. If it interests me and seems like a strong story, I try to get it in!</p>
<p><strong>Despite sharing some narrative DNA, this sequel feels like it can be played by those unfamiliar with the first entry. How important was it for you to create something that continues the Citizen Sleeper universe, but also works as a standalone?</strong></p>
<p>I think this is always an important part of making a sequel, you have to assume that this is the first game for players. But rather than see this as a limit, I saw it as an opportunity. I have always been a big fan of time skips in stories. When done well, they mix all the existing ingredients of the story, and then the reader or player gets to feel smart and curious as they piece it all back together and tell their own story of what happened in the missing time between.</p>
<p>What is especially fun with a time skip is they often allow for the prequel/sequel order to be read in either way, as discovering where a character came from is as compelling as discovering where they end up. So this was a big focus when making the game, and I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games and being surprised by the often unusual journeys characters may take.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ebd649438a817"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebd649438a817/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The sequel appears to be much more rooted in the RPG genre, with clearly defined class skills, missions and expanded dice mechanics as just a few additions. Were there any other games (video or tabletop) that inspired these mechanics during development?</strong></p>
<p>As with the first game, Citizen Sleeper 2 was massively inspired by designs and concepts from pen-and-paper TTRPGs. <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel">Blades in the Dark</a> was the first tabletop game I ever ran, and it remains my favourite. It inspired the first game, and with the sequel, I saw the opportunity to adapt more of its systems into a video game. Citizen Sleeper 2’s “push” mechanic, where you accrue stress to gain a bonus to or reroll your dice, is a direct inspiration from that game, and its systems are designed around asking the player to “push their luck”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the stress systems I added to Citizen Sleeper 2, I took inspiration from the myriad of stress systems appearing in tabletop games over the past five years, but especially <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gerdling/mothership-sci-fi-horror-rpg-1st-edition-boxed-set">Mothership</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart:_The_City_Beneath">Heart: The City Beneath</a>. There’s so much good and exciting game design happening in the tabletop scene, and I find it a constant inspiration for my own work.</p>
<p>On the video game side, my main touchstone was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/mass_effect_2">Mass Effect 2</a>. I wouldn’t say I was attempting to replicate anything from Mass Effect 2, however, more that I wanted to make a game that approached similar ideas in a different way. I often find this is a way I like to work in games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/in_other_waters">In Other Waters</a> was my own take on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, refocusing it on scanning and xenobiology. In the same way, Citizen Sleeper is my own take on the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series, shifting the focus from saving the galaxy as a supercop to learning to live and survive in the margins of an interstellar society.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8285810a21037"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8285810a21037/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With community and home being such an important part of the first game, how does this theme play into the larger setting of the Starward Belt in the sequel, and what challenges do the new hubs pose for the Sleeper?</strong></p>
<p>Ideas of home play out a little differently in Citizen Sleeper 2: rather than having a massive urban megastructure as the location, the game plays out over a series of scattered habitats of varying size and style. Because of this, your home really becomes the Rig, a ship you have stolen and that expands and changes over the course of the game. I really want to capture that slow and subtle process of transformation as the ship gains crew and becomes more familiar, and often in writing the game, I found that to be in contrast with the Hubs, which ultimately, you always have to leave.</p>
<p>So I think at the heart of the game is a tension between moving on and settling down, which feels very important to the Citizen Sleeper series in general.</p>
<p><strong>There were many stressful moments in Citizen Sleeper, and now Stress is a mechanic in the sequel. Why did you decide to implement this, and what effect will it have on your relationships in-game?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely, while also opening up the possibility of more stories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stress systems are a fairly popular and well-battle-tested element in many contemporary TTRPGs, and I think that’s because they offer an abstract form of harm vs Health Points. You might take stress from a heist, a difficult negotiation, or babysitting a child, but you hopefully wouldn’t take HP damage! This allows for a broader range of challenges for players and also consequences. I was really aware of the possibilities this opened up for telling a broader range of stories from running TTRPGs, especially ones that aren’t focused on combat. So this was one of the first things I wanted to add to the sequel.</p>
<p>As I developed these ideas in Citizen Sleeper 2, stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game. It represents the stress your body is under and the possibility that the pressure might turn into real and permanent harm. It represents your crew’s eagerness to continue working on a contract when things don’t go well. It also represents more abstract ideas, like how quickly a derelict ship is falling apart, or the opinions of a disgruntled crew turning against their captain. So stress bars of various kinds will have a huge effect on your path through Citizen Sleeper 2, and I think managing them is one of the most compelling and tense parts of the game.</p>
<p>This time around, I really wanted the game to be stressful, compelling and filled with emergent stories of success and failure. Stress is the tool that allows me to achieve that.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8d4943da6bf49"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d4943da6bf49/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You recently told</strong> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-will-be-the-last-citizen-sleeper-video-game"><strong>Eurogamer</strong></a> <strong>that Citizen Sleeper 2 would be the last video game in the Citizen Sleeper universe, but a tabletop adaptation is still on the cards for the future. How does it feel to be thinking about returning the game to its tabletop roots and is there anything you feel will be lost/gained in the process?</strong></p>
<p>I’m very early in the process of making a Citizen Sleeper TTRPG (as you might imagine, I’ve been busy with the sequel!), but I have a very clear objective with it. I’m really happy with the two games and the story they tell in this universe. I think Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely while also opening up the possibility of more stories. My aim with the TTRPG is to hand the tools to tell those stories over to the player and to let them carry whichever threads catch their interest forward with their friends (or start totally new ones).</p>
<p>What gets left behind by doing that is, of course, my own presence as the narrator of those stories, but I think after two games, there are a lot of references for people to go to if that’s what they want. What is gained is the radical openness of a tabletop system, the chance for players to fill in the gaps in a meaningful way and really explore their connections to the universe’s characters and ideas. Which, in a way, is what these games have been about all along.</p>

But TL;DR, <strong>Story of Seasons</strong> is the OG – the original farming game series that sparked thousands of copycats hoping to carve out a slice of that cosy game pie.</p>
<p>And who can blame them? The farming game genre is a fantastic, strange little thing, and for a long time, Story of Seasons was the absolute King. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_the_river_king"><em>River</em> King</a>, if you will. That's just a fun little Harvest Moon joke for the fans.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly... they weren't. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> kicked down the door in 2016 and began eating original developer Marvelous' lunch, it was suddenly open season for farming game developers, and everyone was grabbing guns. Everyone, that is, except Marvelous.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytylLGp-DIVlY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436lgsmrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>While other studios were riffing on the formula with dinosaurs, corpses, slimes, witches, and queer relationships, Marvelous faltered, releasing mid-tier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doraemon_story_of_seasons">Doraemon</a> tie-ins, remakes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_friends_of_mineral_town">Friends of Mineral Town</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_a_wonderful_life">A Wonderful Life</a> (which were admittedly good, but a little geriatric compared to modern farming games), and the only original release, the empty grind-fest that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_pioneers_of_olive_town">Pioneers of Olive Town</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3aceb35044bde"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aceb35044bde/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was starting to seem like the glory days of Story of Seasons games were long behind us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/story_of_seasons_trio_of_towns">Trio of Towns</a>, the last SoS game made in a pre-Stardew world, was one of their best. It seemed like Marvelous was spooked by their competition, and worse, like they were trying to <em>copy</em> it – Pioneers of Olive Town cribbed heavily and clumsily from Stardew's homework rather than remembering what made them the genre trailblazer in the first place. Even Natsume's <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> spinoffs started getting better than Story of Seasons, which is like watching a pug with three legs outrun a greyhound.</p>
<p>So by the time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Grand Bazaar</a> was announced – another remake, this time of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">much less popular Story of Seasons game</a> (albeit one with a cult following) – I had already grown jaded. It would probably be <em>fine</em>. It couldn't possibly be worse than Pioneers of Olive Town's deserted towns and dull mines.</p>
<p>But they did it! They actually did it! Marvelous dug deep, went back to the drawing board, found an ember of their old magic hidden at the back of a cupboard, and nurtured it into a roaring flame.</p>

<p>Grand Bazaar's remake is deep, detailed, <em>gorgeous</em>, and as a delightful surprise, fully voiced. No longer is Marvelous looking over its shoulder at the other farming games on the market. No longer are they trying to keep up with the cool kids. Instead, Story of Seasons is finally getting back in touch with its roots, focusing on characters, a sense of community, and that signature supernatural silliness that brought us things like Vinnie the talking plant and the Harvest Sprites.</p>
<p>Even better, I feel like you can tell that the developers themselves are happier. Pioneers of Olive Town felt like a game that struggled to find its identity – often the result of over-iterating on the design with no clear vision, or more simply, just not having a ton of money or time – whereas Grand Bazaar practically <em>glows</em> with personality. There are small touches of care and detail everywhere, from the flags and window shutters flapping in the wind to the post-game addition of the Happy Bingo system, just to give players more to do.</p>
<p>There are tons of additions to the original game, including new characters, villager requests, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-inspired gliding system, voiced dialogue, character customisation, and the all-important same-gender romance – all of which show a great deal of knowledge about what the farming game community likes to see in these sorts of games.</p>
<figure data-uuid="735fdb0231920"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/735fdb0231920/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And then there's the Bazaar itself. I never played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">the original</a>, but from what I understand, it was a much simpler thing, which has been entirely reworked and expanded, with deeper systems. It also does away with some of the frustrations of its predecessor, like customer questions. It's an insightful way to bring the game up to modern tastes without losing the flavour that made those old games successful in the first place, and I can't wait to see them channel these learnings into a new, original game.</p>
<p>We probably won't get any insight into what it was like to develop Grand Bazaar, but I wouldn't be surprised if Marvelous did some drastic reshaping of the studio and its development processes to make Grand Bazaar as good as it is. It's not just pretty – because Friends of Mineral Town and A Wonderful Life were pretty – it's a game that finally stands up to others in the competitive farming game genre. I just hope that it's not a fluke.</p>
<p>I really, really want to see Marvelous continue to prove why they've been around for so long, and Grand Bazaar is, at last, a step in the right direction.</p>
