<figure><a title="Popplio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c2867edeea91/popplio.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's not every day that you get to meet The Pope, but one Pokémon fan decided to make the most of his recent trip to The Vatican on 5th July.</p>
<p>Reddit user ReptileCake took two Pokémon cards with him when meeting Pope Leo (real name Robert Francis Prevost): one to get blessed, and one to get signed. But why? Why Pokémon cards, specifically? Well, the Pokémon in question is Popplio!</p>
<p>Get it..? Popplio. Pope Leo. Guffaw!</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fan-meets-pope-leo-gets-him-to-sign-a-popplio-pokemon-trading-card-and-it-looks-like-the-pontiff-got-the-joke?utm_source=campaigner&amp;utm_campaign=NL_FIX_July_08_2025&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;Ictg=45858995214">IGN</a>, ReptileCake said that Pope Leo took the whole thing in his stride and clearly understood the reference, happily signing the card in question:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftzlykh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was pretty chill. We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p>
<p>"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the card immediately gaining a significant amount of worth, ReptileCake says that he has no intention of selling it on, stating that Pope Leo agreeing to sign the card is "worth more than any monetary value can satisfy", and that it is now "a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity".</p>

<p>So there you have it! Quite a wholesome little incident, all told. Though we imagine this will kickstart a rather concerning trend in which fans flock to the Vatican to get their own Pokémon cards signed.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ball game for scalpers, huh?</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-switch-2-and-steam-deck-face-off-in-cyberpunk-2077-benchmark-test</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-switch-2-and-steam-deck-face-off-in-cyberpunk-2077-benchmark-test.1239306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Digital Foundry is back with another Switch 2 video; this time looking at how the console holds up next to the Steam Deck when benchmark testing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot to get into with this, so we'll let the video do most of the talking, but in a nutshell, we're looking at multiple benchmark tests in docked and handheld mode with the Switch 2, including CDPR's 'official' test, the Kabuki run test, and The Beast In Me test.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the Switch 2 is leagues ahead of the Steam Deck when docked, with much better image quality thanks to DLSS, and a much more consistent frame rate in quality mode. In performance mode, during which the Switch 2 targets 40fps, there's a lot more inconsistency, but it still manages to outclass the Steam Deck for the most part.</p>
<p>Handheld mode is a different story. Performance mode isn't available for the Switch 2 in handheld, so we're looking at a target of 30fps, but interestingly, Nintendo's new console showcases slightly more instability than the Steam Deck during both the Kabuki run and The Beast In Me (albeit at a higher resolution). That said, the Switch 2 is much, <em>much</em> more efficient, drawing around 8.9w compared to the Steam Deck's 24.5w. Essentially, the Switch 2 is able to almost match the Steam Deck's performance using just 36% of the latter's power.</p>
<p>In fact, when lowering the power draw in the Steam Deck to match that of the Switch 2, the Steam Deck effectively runs in slow motion, with frame rate dropping to around 9-13fps. Of course, this won't mean a whole lot in real world use cases, but it's interesting to see the stark difference between the two.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that when replicating the Switch 2's performance on PC, a lot of the settings, including crowd density, contact shadows, volumetric cloud, and more are actually quite similar to that of the PS5 in performance mode. Not bad at all for Nintendo's new hardware!</p>
