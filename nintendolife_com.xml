<figure><a title="Fitness Boxing 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72c977ba4e490/fitness-boxing-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1961111538648899967">Nintendo has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_2_rhythm_and_exercise">Fitness Boxing 2</a> will be taken off of the eShop later this year.</p>
<p>On <strong>2</strong><strong>3rd November 2025 at 23:59</strong>, it will no longer be possible to buy the Nintendo-published game from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Fitness-Boxing-2-Rhythm-Exercise-1843189.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=FitnessBoxing|NULL|ProductDiscontinuation|m_id_2tBvHJYJ48|1843189">digital storefront</a>. If you already own the game digitally, you'll be able to redownload it.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this has only been confirmed <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1961111538648899967">by Nintendo UK on X</a>, but we imagine other regions will follow suit. No reason has been given for the removal, but fans speculate that it's due to the licenses for some in-game music running out.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/19611115386488">https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/19611115386488</a></p>
<p>This happened with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing">Fitness Boxing</a> game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/fitness-boxing-is-being-removed-from-switch-eshop-later-this-year">back in 2023</a>, but just like that game you can also pick up a physical copy.</p>
<p>Presumably, Fitness Boxing 3 is safe for now, but given that this has happened with the first two games, it wouldn't be surprising if 3 was removed later down the line.</p>
<p><em>Do you have Fitness Boxing 2? Will you be grabbing it off the eShop before it's removed? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>
