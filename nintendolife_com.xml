<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is now exclusively available for the Switch 2, and to help get the race underway, the first in-game event has been officially announced.</p>
<p>This marks the beginning of "regularly scheduled in-game events" for Kirby Air Riders, which may or may not remind you of the limited-time events in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. During these events, participants will be able to earn rewards such as "street names, stickers, and themes" to customise their license.</p>
<p>These events are currently planned to run for "a year after launch", so get ready for many more in the future! You'll be able to access them from the main menu of Kirby Air Riders, which you can see in the screenshot below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adnviuly&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The first event is titled "Everyone, to the Stadium!" and sees everyone gather at the same Stadium contest in a fixed eight-player Trial, with the goal being to take out the top spot. Fortunately, there's still time to train up - with the event scheduled for next week. It will run from <strong>27th November</strong> to <strong>30th November</strong>.</p>

<p>Okay, is the vampire in *this* coffin?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> is the gift that keeps on giving. We've had a countless amount of free updates, expansive paid DLCs, and so much content that it's so easy to lose hundreds of hours to. So, how's about a completely new game?</p>
<p>Yep, Poncle is spreading its wings and today announced a spin-off to Vampire Survivors, called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_crawlers_the_turbo_wildcard_from_vampire_survivors">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors</a> (we'll stick to Vampire Crawlers...) coming to Switch in 2026. The tongue-in-cheek trailer above tells you it isn't a roguelite deckbuilder, but it is in fact a roguelite deckbuilding dungeon crawler. <em>Fancy that</em>.</p>
<p>But, in true Vampire Survivors fashion, it's absolutely nuts. Essentially, as Poncle founder Luca Galante puts it on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>, Vampire Crawlers is "about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer."</p>
<p>Galante also compares the game to a "blobber", a type of first-person RPG popular in the '80s that often used giant on-screen buttons; instead of the buttons, Crawlers uses cards.</p>
<p>Here's a brief little rundown from the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is Vampire Crawlers about</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</p>
<p><strong>- Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't worry, this isn't a direct sequel, and Vampire Survivors will still be a thing going forward. But Galante does mention something interesting: "With regards to a sequel to <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’re working on <em>something</em>, but we’re not talking about that just yet."</p>
<p>Stay tuned, then...</p>

<p>Update: Here's a new trailer</p>
</section></header><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-11-20T20:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Thu 20th Nov 2025, 8:30pm</time>]:</strong> Things have been a little quiet on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> DLC front. Well, during today's Xbox Showcase, we got a fresh new look at the upcoming content update, along with a new early 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Announced during The Game Awards last year and originally due to launch in 2025, <strong>In The Jungle</strong> takes Dave away from the Blue Hole and onto dry land.</p>
<p>The jungle gives Dave a bunch of new creatures to catch and ingredients to work with in his sushi restaurant. You get a brief look at what to expect from the DLC at the <a href="https://youtu.be/PFbcVdZRKwE?si=J59eXQrcmR4B6Pe9&amp;t=34">34 second mark</a> in the trailer up top, but we've also got a few new screenshots, too.</p>
<p>For more details, check out our original story from last year below. And hey, don't forget about that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, which will be getting a physical version in early 2026 courtesy of Silver Lining Direct.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>Fri 13th Dec, 2024 11:45 GMT</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> has quickly become one of the most bankable titles for an appearance at <em>each and every game showcase</em> since it arrived on PC and console last year, and The Game Awards was no exception.</p>
<p>Developer MINTROCKET popped up at this year's Geoff-fest to reveal the upcoming '<strong>In the Jungle</strong>' DLC, an expansion that will see Dave and co. leave the Blue Hole and set out into greener pastures (literally) to search for their next catch.</p>
<p>We don't have all that much information on what the DLC entails for the time being, though the swanky cinematic trailer did give us a release window of "<strong>Late 2025</strong>", so that's something to look forward to next year — dare we say on 'Switch 2'?</p>
<p>This comes after a stellar year of Dave the Diver content drops, including a whole host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/dave-the-divers-latest-crossover-update-arrives-today-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">crossovers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/dave-the-diver-catches-new-minigame-in-latest-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">new minigames</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/free-godzilla-dlc-storms-into-dave-the-diver-next-week-on-switch">Godzilla</a>? Damn, what a game.</p>
