<p>After being announced just over a week ago <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-brings-ds-rpgs-to-switch-in-2026">during the Japanese Nintendo Direct broadcast</a>, Capcom has shared an updated trailer and a few new details about the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer was shown during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rD0i4pOTk">Capcom's TGS 2025 Online Program</a> and, as you'd expect from this compilation of DS RPGs, the team has introduced a couple of new features to help modernise the experience and provide a package that loyal fans will love.</p>
<p>These include a toggleable high-resolution filter, an in-game gallery featuring over 1000 pieces of art, a music player — plus "new versions of favourite tracks" — and difficulty and assist settings, which look to include different screen settings, similar to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> from Konami and M2.</p>
<p>Plus, in another win for fans, cards that were exclusive to special events and toys will be available in-game. So this is the complete experience for the entire series.</p>

<p>The latest Mega Man collection is due to drop on Switch in 2026, so we'll bring you that release date as soon as we know!</p>
