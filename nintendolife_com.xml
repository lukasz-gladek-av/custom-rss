<p>Or... a re-remaster?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios has announced yet another remaster for release later this year on <strong>4th December 2025</strong> (which, as a reminder, clashes with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>).</p>
<p>Confirmed for "PC and consoles", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blood_refreshed_supply">Blood: Refreshed Supply</a> is an updated version of the studio's 2019 remaster, <strong>Blood: Fresh Supply</strong>, which itself was a remaster of, uh, <strong>Blood</strong>. The original game launched in 1997 and was developed by the now-defunct Monolith Productions.</p>
<p>This new version benefits from a bunch of added extras, including add-ons Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage, new Marrow and Death Wish missions, behind-the-scenes content revealing key development details, and more.</p>
<p>But of course, just having this on the Switch is pretty cool in itself, though we're still keen to see native Switch 2 ports of Nightdive games so we can get performance parity with PS5 and Xbox. Alas, the wait continues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- The legendary blood-soaked shooter</strong> comes to consoles for the very first time!</p>
