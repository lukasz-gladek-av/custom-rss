<figure data-uuid="57fc17a8e0b65"><a title="Diablo IV" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/57fc17a8e0b65/diablo-iv.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Blizzard</em></figcaption></figure><p>Blizzard kicked off 30th anniversary celebrations for the <strong>Diablo</strong> series yesterday with a 40-minute spotlight, focusing on updates and new content for the franchise's current games. However, one question remains unanswered: is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/diablo_4">Diablo IV</a> coming to Switch 2? And, additionally, what about a Switch 2 Edition for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/diablo_ii_resurrected">Diablo II: Resurrected</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-about-switch-2-versions-of-diablo-2-and-diablo-4">Eurogamer's Robert Purchase</a> attempted to get some clarity, but instead was told that "the company had nothing to say on the matter". A little disappointing, given how successful Diablo 3 <em>and</em> Diablo II have proven on Switch 1, but we'd be surprised if <em>nothing</em> is happening.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qtxhjl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Especially as Robert <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hearthstone-isnt-on-console-switch-or-steam-deck-but-increasingly-likely-to-happen">spoke to Hearthstone's executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith</a> who, when talking about a possible Switch 2 port of the card game, told a room of journalists "In the future as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could". So a wider console base <em>is</em> at least being thought about.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been rumours about Diablo 4 coming to Switch 2 as far back <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-diablo-4-is-claimed-to-be-in-development-for-switch-2">as April 2025</a>, with even series manager Rod Fergusson stating that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/diablo-4-on-switch-2-its-something-to-look-at-says-series-manager">"something to look at"</a>, though it's not guaranteed due to potential live service issues.</p>
<p>Blizzard are, of course, working on getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (that's the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/overwatch-2-ditches-the-number-in-huge-overhaul-switch-2-version-announced">formerly known as Overwatch 2</a>) on Switch 2, and that's due later in the year. But with Diablo II already on the older console, we should at least expect that one, right?</p>
<p>Nothing is guaranteed of course, and Diablo's 30th anniversary isn't actually until 2027, so don't be surprised if we hear something about this much later in the year. At least you can enjoy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/diablo-ii-resurrected-announces-new-warlock-class-and-its-available-today">the new Warlock class</a> in Diablo II on Switch 1 right now.</p>

<p>Full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="16f4b2ee5310b"><a title="Absolum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/16f4b2ee5310b/absolum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Right on schedule, Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, and Supamonks have dropped a big free update for the excellent roguelite beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. And alongside some brand new gameplay modes and run-changing updates, we've got a swathe up bug fixes, character balance tweaks, and more.</p>
<p>We've covered the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/absolums-first-free-content-update-arrives-next-month">Threads of Fate update previously</a>, but it's worth reminding yourself what's included. Mystic Ordeals are a brand new way to embark on runs, which add modifiers and challenges. Corrupted Biomes replace the Rifts system, optional areas within zones that yield great rewards. The Soul Tree has gained new rewards like Elite mounts and additional character skins. And a new "devilish ambush" in the Forest biome.</p>
<p>On top of the new content, the devs have also rebalanced each of the four characters, made a few regional tweaks, and tweaked some enemy AI.</p>
<p>Here's a full rundown of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1904480">patch from Steam</a>:</p>
