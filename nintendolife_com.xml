<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62ddaba56e80d/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo, in its ongoing battle against Pocketpair and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/palworld">Palworld</a>, has been filing various patents left, right, and centre in the US, the latest of which is almost certainly cause for concern.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Games Fray</a>, Patent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-custom-tracking-id="5652783286200639599" data-google-interstitial="false" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-hl-processed="none" data-url="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf" href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf">No. 12,403,39</a> has been granted which essentially covers the summoning of a sub character and letting it fight on your behalf. Now, we're not sure about you, but we can already think of quite a few games that make use of such mechanics outside of Pokémon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, for example?</p>
<p>It goes into further detail and states that the sub character can either be controller by issuing commands, or it can act on its own accord, battling enemies automatically should any appear within the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>So, according to analysis from Games Fray, games that make us of <em>all</em> of the following could potentially trigger an infringement lawsuit from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. There must be a PC, console or other computing device and the game is stored on a drive or similar storage medium.</p>
<p>2. You can move a character in a virtual space.</p>
<p>3. You must be able to summon a character. They call it a “sub character” by which they mean it’s not the player character, but, for example, a little monster such as a Pokémon that the player character has at its disposal.</p>
<p>Then the logic branches out, with items 4 and 5 being mutually exclusive scenarios, before reuniting again in item 6.</p>
<p>4. This is about summoning the “sub character” in a place where there already is another character that it will then (when instructed to do so) fight.</p>
<p>5. This alternative scenario is about summoning the “sub character” at a position where there is no other character to fight immediately.</p>
<p>6. This final step is about sending the “sub character” in a direction and then letting an automatic battle ensue with another character. It is not clear whether this is even needed if one previously executed step (4) where the “sub character” will basically be thrown at another character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world of patents is complicated, and we've no doubt that there will be a number of loop holes that developers could potentially take advantage of to avoid Nintendo's wrath. It's not good though, is it? This is such a wide-reaching game mechanic, and so many titles already make use of it.</p>
<p>This isn't just targeting Palworld, let's put it that way. Whether Nintendo actually intends to make use of the patent in its legal battle against Pocketpair is unclear at this stage, but the mere fact that it exists is a bit of a blow.</p>

<p>Introducing the Detective and Viper</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Among Us" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee65c8e5c04b/among-us.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a> has received a new update across all platforms this week, bumping it up to Version 17.0.0 and adding two new roles to the game along with various quality of life updates.</p>
<p>The new roles include the Detective and the Viper. Here's a rundown about both roles courtesy of developer Innersloth, along with a look:</p>
<h3>Detective<br></h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Keep track of a dead Crewmate’s location, your list of suspects, and what kind of Impostor you’re looking for.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Interrogate:</strong> Start questioning your fellow Crewmates, and find out where they were during the crime!</p>
<p>You can only use the ability on one active case at a time! You’ll need to switch the file if you’re researching multiple murders.</p>
<p>You can change how many Interrogations a Detective can do via the advanced role settings when you’re in the Dropship.</p>
<p>When we made this role, we really wanted to make Emergency Meeting discussions even more fun!</p>
<p>Be careful, though! As you start putting the pieces together, you might be the Impostor’s next target. Make sure to grab a fresh notebook and your magnifying glass — you’re gonna need ’em!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Viper</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>This new Impostor role is perfect for destroying, or in this case, dissolving their victims. Use a well-timed Sabotage to keep the rest of the crew busy while you use your <strong>Acid</strong> ability and watch the Crewmate’s body slowly melt away. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>After a kill, the Crewmate corpse will decay in 3 stages: slightly dissolved, very dissolved, and then just a bone before it’s completely gone.</p>
<p>You can adjust how quickly the corpse dissolves in the advanced role settings in the Dropship.</p>
<p>Before long, the body is gone, and all you have to worry about is your alibi. Time it right and you might achieve the ultimate Impostor dream: killing without leaving any trace of it behind. No one’s going to call an Emergency Meeting when there’s nothing, right?</p>
<p>If you find yourself on the unfortunate end of the Viper’s acidic spit, sadly… this is your end. But at least you’ll be treated to a brand new kill animation before you watch your body start to sizzle.</p>
<p>We had a great time testing these roles and are excited to see how y’all handle these new abilities — whether you become The Skeld’s greatest detective or you just want to go around spitting at other Crewmates (a lil gross, ngl), it’s sure to be a ton of fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As for the QoL updates, players can expect updates to the guide settings, role settings, and an improvement to practice mode. There are various other fixes and bugs addressed in this latest update as well.</p>

<p>"It’s a pig, it’s a plane, it’s the Superman DLC"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>To celebrate the recent Superman movie in cinemas, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> has received some themed DLC on the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>It gives fans a chance to play as Superman, use his powers like Super Strength and Heat Vision, and take down villains, all while protecting Metropolis. You'll also be able to fly to the Fortress of Solitude to "hang out with Kypto".</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the official Minecraft website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this DLC, Lex Luthor is opening a shelter for lost puppies, providing food, shelter, and love. HA! Of course, that’s not what he’s doing. No, no, no, he’s doing evil stuff, as per usual.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>More specifically, he’s orchestrating a most disturbing scheme, perhaps his most disturbing scheme yet (and there’s not a puppy in sight). But Lex is no fool, he knows that Superman constantly foils his masterplans, so to keep the cape-clad avenger (you) occupied, he’s stirring ruckus in Metropolis so that he can work in peace.</p>
<p>To unravel the mystery and save Metropolis, you'll have to swoosh through the air, punch, beam, and freeze your enemies, crack puzzles, and if you ever need any help, you can always ask <em>Daily Planet</em> intrepid reporter Lois Lane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alongside this paid DLC, there's also a free Superman fan top you can redeem in the game's Dressing Room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Obviously, you want to flaunt and flash the classic Superman “S”, so we’re handing out a free Character Creator item – the Superman fan top! Find it in the Dressing Room and show the world whose side you’re on (NOT Lex Luthor’s!)."</p>

<p>Once again, Minecraft hasn't received an upgrade or anything similar for the Switch 2 (at least yet), but if we hear any updates about this, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
