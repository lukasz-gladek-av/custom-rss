<p>The timings for the event are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6pm (Thu) PDT / 7pm (Thu) MDT / 8pm (Thu) CDT / 9pm (Thu) EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3am CEST / 4am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10am JST / 9am AWST / 11am AEST</li></ul><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nlqust&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The official video description reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARC SYSTEM WORKS Showcase will be broadcast, delivering the latest information on Arc System Works, including the announcement of new titles!</p>
<p>"In addition to the latest information on various game titles, including completely new titles developed and published by Arc System Works, we will also be announcing a new project that Ishiwatari Taisuke is working on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we can probably expect to see a bit more from the studio's upcoming project with Sony Interactive Entertainment, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, which is scheduled to launch on PS5 and PC next year. Since Switch / Switch 2 owners won't be partaking in this release (yet), however, we're far more interested in the "announcement of new titles".</p>
<p>Arc System Works has developed and published a few key Switch titles in the past, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear: Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_cross_tag_battle">BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</a>, so we wouldn't be surprised to see something new for Nintendo platforms in the future.</p>
<p>Specifically, Taisuke-san is tied closely to the Guilty Gear series, and with Strive originally launching four years back, it could well be time to see what's next in the long-running fighting franchise.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be keeping a close eye on the upcoming showcase and will share any relevant news with you as soon as it happens.</p>

<p>Plus a new 'PURE' performance mode</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Fast Fusion - PURE Update 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4d6772b28bbdb/fast-fusion-pure-update-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Shin'en Multimedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shin'en Multimedia has been hard at work on the first major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> on the Switch 2, and we can now exclusively reveal that it will launch this week on <strong>26th June 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>But what do you get with it? Well, Shin'en has confirmed to us that the 'Pure Update' – which is completely free, by the way – will contain three new tracks based on classics from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These will be largely faithful recreations of fan favourites from the original 2017 Switch launch title, but with small tweaks to make use of the new 'Hyperjump' feature along with all new visuals and effects.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b9621oxwmgr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Carbium Cup</h2>
<p>- Alpine Trust<br>
- Sunahara Plains<br>
- Zenshoh Habitat</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the new tracks, the Pure Update will also include a new performance mode simply called 'Pure', which renders at 1440p dynamic resolution with no upscaling applied. Fan feedback from the game's release was that the visuals could often look a little blurry due to the application of DLSS, so hopefully this new option will completely erradicate this.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Shin'en has also shared that the Alpine Trust track will implement a new GPU particle system for the snowflakes effect, and we honestly can't wait to see this in action. We're also getting two new Jukebox entries, tweaks to make progression slightly easier (specifically a lower price for the third cup), a bug fix to resolve a rare crash when switching rendering modes often, and several smaller fixes and corrections.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the new tracks:</p>


<p>Fast Fusion is a real showstopper launch title for the Switch 2, earning a well-deserved score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">9/10 in our review</a>. We said that it's "easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far" and is "an absolute must-buy" for new Switch 2 owners.</p>
<p>If, however, you thought the overall content was a little slim, then hopefully this first major update will help alleviate this with the addition of three new tracks.</p>

<p>"About 3 times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="slow lcd df switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fbd80acc0dfd/slow-lcd-df-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">reported a few days back</a> that the boffins over at Digital Foundry were less than impressed with the Switch 2's LCD screen after running various tests on it.</p>
<p>Now, however, DF's John Linneman has <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1937199770788901151">weighed in on social media</a> to confirm that the new screen is more "problematic" than had first appeared—and then some.</p>
<p>On his social media, Linneman pointed to tests run on the Switch 2 LCD on a specialist PC Monitor site, <a href="https://chimolog.co/">Chimilog</a>:</p>

<p>As you can see, the Switch 2's screen is at the bottom of the list of LCDs when put through a gauntlet of technical tests to measure its performance. The image in his post, on the left, shows average response times of 32 LCDs, and the Switch 2 lands with the worst time here.</p>
<p>Linneman also compares the performance to being "about three times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD" and states once again, as we'd covered in our previous article, that it's actually <em>worse</em> in some ways than the 2017 Switch LCD.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, we (or this writer at the very least) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">have been very happy with our screens thus far</a>, and judging by the general reception to it, most gamers perhaps don't need to sweat this stuff.</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame that the screen just doesn't seem to be up to the standard it perhaps could, and should, have been as part of a brand new console circa 2025. There's always the Switch 2 OLED Model though, right?</p>
