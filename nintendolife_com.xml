            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>In the last year or two, Microsoft has been very vocal about its desire to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">support Switch and Switch 2</a>. We've seen a couple of examples of this on the new hardware with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> and the soon-to-come <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but where's the <strong>Gears</strong>? Where's the <strong>Call of Duty</strong>? Where's the <strong>Halo?</strong> As it turns out, we're not the only ones who are a little surprised by the lack of support so far.</p>
<p>Reggie Fils-Aimé recently took a break from playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on his Nintendo 3DS to sit down with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a>' Christopher Dring and talk all things Switch 2. Microsoft's pledged support was one of the topics that cropped up in conversation, and the former NoA president confessed that he'd expected to see more.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," Reggie said, "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to the Switch 2". He even went more specific with his predictions, stating, "I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday. All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I'm surprised it hasn't happened."</p>
<p>Recent months have seen <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> blast onto PS5, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will be making a similar leap at some point next year. Phil Spencer has said, time and again, how keen he is to support Nintendo systems, so it makes sense that Reggie might have been expecting more, particularly with two of the studio's biggest franchises already venturing to pastures new.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Mr. Fils-Aimé has necessarily been disappointed with the Switch 2's software slate so far, though he admits that he's found Nintendo's output a little confusing: "From a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit" — come on, who honestly had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> on their launch year bingo card?</p>
<p>"What I underestimated was the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, which I think has been compelling," he continued. "The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> was a key driver for them.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Reggie discusses the console war, Switch 2's meaty sales numbers and what the future of the industry might look like. You'll find a video version at the top of this article, or you can check it out in writing over on <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a> website.</p>

<p>Launching 2026</p>

<figure data-uuid="ef23178a376c2"><a title="Lego Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef23178a376c2/lego-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released a short teaser video confirming a new <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> Lego set in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>There's not a whole lot to go on for now, but it seems to indicate that we'll be getting some sort of incarnation of Ganon. The shadow rising up from the bottom of the screen to confront Lego Link appears to be pretty large and takes the rough shape of the pig-like villain. We wouldn't be surprised to see Ganondorf either, though.</p>
<p>It's likely that the new set will be based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-new-zelda-lego-set-rumour-links-it-to-fan-favourite-entry">previous rumour pointing to a potential release in March 2026.</a> The video also showcases what looks to be Navi floating beside Link, and we can also see Zelda herself in the background.</p>

<p>Lego fans can already get their hands on the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set, which originally launched in 2024. We gave it a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-2-in-1-a-superb-debut-with-one-minor-irritation">8/10 in our review</a> and said that while "details and nods to the games are plentiful, but with no easy way to convert one to the other, you’re going to have your work cut out for you if you want to get the most out of this one".</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep an eye out for a proper reveal in the days and weeks to come, but for now, colour us excited!</p>
