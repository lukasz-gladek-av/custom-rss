            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/classic-atari-2600-title-adventure-is-being-revived-as-a-metroidvania<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We must admit, when Atari announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> over the weekend, it took us a good couple of minutes to realise it was officially linked to the classic 2600 game <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a>.</p>
<p>Watching the trailer, the overall look and feel of the game didn't really form any connections in our mind, but then the title came up and we thought <em>"heh, Adventure of Samsara from Atari, that's kinda like the original Adventure"</em>. Slumped in chairs after caning the Switch 2 for a few days, the penny finally dropped.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Adventure of Samsara is, according to Atari, a completely new game set in the world of Adventure. In other words, then, it's neither a sequel not a remake. It is, however, a metroidvania, kinda like what the company did with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yars_rising">Yars Rising</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by indie studio Ilex Games, Adventure of Samsara will see you traverse 10 unique biomes with gameplay reminiscent of classic Prince of Persia titles. And, of course, for those who recovered the Enchanted Chalice and perhaps discovered Warren Robinett's hidden room in the original 1980 game, there will be plenty of curious easter eggs to discover.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.</p>
<p>- <strong>Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.</p>
<p>- <strong>Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.</p>
<p>- <strong>Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.</p>
<p>- <strong>Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no date for Adventure of Samsara yet beyond the current 2025 window, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-transferring-pics-from-switch-2-to-pc-via-usb-c-only-works-via-the-bottom-slot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="usb-c" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01cca1554615b/usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, I'm not entirely sure how much you take and use screenshots on your Nintendo Switch or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles, but let me tell you, I take tons and I use even more. So connecting to a Switch to my laptop via USB has become my go-to way to get my game shots up and ready for scrutiny where I need them.</p>
<p>So, you'll understand, I'm sure, my sadness in finding that you can only transfer data such as screenshots betwixt Switch 2 and PC using the bottom of two USB-C connections whilst using this option. What this leads to, dear friends, is a tragic situation, as you can see in my (terrible) photos, where the Switch 2 needs to be set lying down at an angle as it can no longer sit upright properly. The horror.</p>
<p>Indeed, using the top slot sees you greeted with an easy-to-miss message that, no, you'll need to use the bottom slot.</p>

<p>We're sure there's a perfectly valid reason. It's a shame, though, as if the top USB-C allowed it, I could look approximately 76% tidier (and thusly cooler) being able to do all this with my Switch 2 on its stand all nice and proper. But oh no. Well, not yet, anyway. Maybe Mario or one of those Nintendo big shots will see this and get it sorted.</p>
<p>Of course, there <em>are</em> easier ways to get your pics off your Switch, especially by just uploading screens to your phone, which works fine in most cases, so it's not a big issue. Simply open up your album, choose a shot and upload to your phone. But if I did it this way, well, I wouldn't have anything to complain about, would I?</p>
<p>You can also, if you are hip and trendy, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch-2/How-to-Upload-Screenshots-and-Videos-from-Nintendo-Switch-2-to-the-Nintendo-Switch-App-2843767.html#:~:text=You%20can%20set%20up%20your,enable%20or%20disable%20this%20feature.">use the Nintendo Switch app to automatically upload all of your screenshots</a>, without the need to stress at all. Again, where would I be for articles if I used these more modern techniques, I ask you?</p>
<p>In this case, all you need to do (besides having the app installed) is to go to your Album, select the cog on the bottom left of the screen, then select your user icon to head into Upload settings and turn on auto uploads. Hey, it turns out I <em>was</em> doing it a really dumb way, after all.</p>

<p>It's an ancient art form, though, this unnecessary grumbling about new things, you understand. Surely you've noticed something about the console that's irked you? Magnets too strong? Screen too big? Games too good? Come on, there must be something!</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef69b31de3c5d/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite some gripes with the D-pad, it was tough to imagine how Nintendo might improve on the Switch Pro Controller until we finally got our hands on the new one. And while it's a pricey upgrade and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-do-you-even-need-a-pro-controller-for-the-switch-2">one that you might want to put off</a> if you've got a perfectly functioning Switch 1 version, the Pro Controller 2 is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a very nice bit of kit</a>.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, industrious gamers have been dismantling the console and its accessories since launch, and <a href="https://gametraderzero.com/blogs/news/switch-2-pro-controller-tear-down-what-s-new-inside-nintendo-s-new-controller">GameTraderZero</a> has taken the new pad apart to see what makes it tick and how easy it will be to repair should something go wrong.</p>
<p>Giving us a good look at the innards, it appears that Nintendo turned to <a href="https://tech.alpsalpine.com/e/products-info/components/">Alps Alpine</a> (a Japanese company that specialises in automotive and consumer electronic components such as switches) to supply the sticks for this pad - or at least some of them.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lr5z4ewo622v">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, you can see the back of the stick module bearing the manufacturer's name and what appears to be a custom stick design for the Switch 2 controller.</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly for people who like to repair, mod, or just fiddle with their gear, GameTraderZero points out that the design used means replacement is possible without the need to fetch the soldering iron. Hurrah!</p>
<p>However, they also point out that "more intricate internal design" of the pad and other factors make it more complicated to disassemble compared to the old version. If you've played Welcome Tour, Nintendo details the challenges of moulding the new pad in such a way that your hand wouldn't rest on grooves which would collect everyday grime and dust.</p>
<p>The intense interest in the Switch 2's analog(ue) sticks stems from the infamous '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/joy--con-drift">Joy-Con drift</a>' issues that plagued the Switch 1's controllers. Teardowns of the new Joy-Con reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-owners-are-already-stripping-down-joy-con-to-check-the-stick-tech">sticks that look quite similar to the last-gen version</a>, too, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/the-end-of-joy-con-stick-drift-the-switch-2s-controllers-have-been-redesigned-from-the-ground-up">Nintendo says</a> they've been totally redesigned.</p>
<p>While the Pro Controller didn't suffer in the same way, it's nice to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-switch-2-sticks-might-not-be-hall-effect-but-they-feel-fantastic">these smooth-feeling upgrades</a> in the latest 'Pro' pad. Hopefully, they'll stand the test of time.</p>
