<p>Check out the first trailer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Netflix's animated series, <strong>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</strong>, is returning to the streaming service next month, with season two kicking off on <strong>11th December</strong>. And look, we even have a trailer!</p>
<p>This second and final season, which once again stars Hayley Atwell in the titular role, sees Lara and co. race across the globe to get their hands on some ancient masks that pack some mysterious powers. There's an uber-rich "techno-visionary" trying to hunt the relics down too, so no prizes for guessing who the goodies and baddies are in this situation.</p>
<p>The all-new trailer (above) gives a taste of the animated action we can expect to find in December, with super-powered headwear, globe-trotting escapades and a fight with a shark — yes, really.</p>
<p>The first series was met with mixed reviews on release last year, but with a live-action adaptation in the works at Amazon and the 2013 game making a surprise appearance on Switch and Switch 2 today, perhaps there will be more interest this time? Somehow, we doubt it, but hey, it's a good time to be a Tomb Raider fan!</p>

<p>Shadow Drop of the Tomb Raider</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Oooof, we love a good shadow drop – <em>love it</em>.</p>
<p>This is one of the coolest we've seen in quite some time, as Aspyr has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is now available – out of <em>nowhere</em> – on the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2013 by Crystal Dynamics as a full reboot of the legendary action-adventure series starring Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition gained critical acclaim for its more grounded approach to exploration, strong visuals, and brutal combat.</p>
<p>We're a little sceptical about the visuals on display here, though. Although this is the Definitive Edition, which was effectively a remastered version of Tomb Raider for the PS4, some key enhancements don't appear to be present here.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious one as far as we can see is the increased fidelity seen on Lara's hair. This was a big talking point back in the day, and if this was possible on PS4, why isn't it present here on the Switch 2? Our guess is the game has probably been optimised primarily for the original Switch and thus lost a few of those enhanced features.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. We're very keen to get stuck into this, and we're hopeful this means <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rise_of_the_tomb_raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will also follow suit at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Fans can already experience a bunch of classic Lara Croft adventures with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> on the Switch, with Aspyr adding newly enhanced visuals alongside the original PS1 aesthetics.</p>
