<p>Simon says spells</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>If you're an adventure game fan of a certain age, you’ll have a place in your heart for <strong>Simon the Sorcerer</strong>. Part of the first major wave of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-point-and-click-adventure-games-for-nintendo-switch">point-and-click adventures</a> back in the late '80s and early '90s, Simon offered a goofy British counterpart to <strong>Monkey Island</strong>’s swashbuckling comedy.</p>
<p>The series now returns with a faithfully written prequel that will delight long-time fans. Telling the tale of the titular conjurer's beginnings as a magical chosen one, we follow Simon as he gets lost in a fantastical world, learns to wield magic, and meets his long-term antagonist, Sordid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a> has all the charm of its predecessors and even brings back <strong>Red Dwarf</strong> actor Chris Barrie, who voiced Simon in the first two games. The dialogue is funny, cynical, and very British. Rick Astley even pops up on the soundtrack for nostalgia-tinged opening credits sequence.</p>
<p>Our sarcastic hero is constantly breaking the fourth wall. At one point, a waypoint appears on your map, only to come crashing down into the actual environment. Elsewhere, Simon frequently looks straight at the player to comment on the ridiculously contrived situations the developers have put him in.</p>
<p>Those situations follow the tried-and-true point-and-click formula of hunting down items and finding ways to use or combine them to fulfil an ever-increasing set of goals. Your bottomless wizard hat stores things of all shapes and sizes. How you use these items in puzzle-solving is seldom straightforward, staying true to the genre’s tradition of clever frustration.</p>
<p>While obtuse solutions are expected of '90s-inspired adventure titles, the logic-stretching still frustrates on occasion. Areas are large enough that it can become a chore to wander through environments, trying all your inventory on everything around you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a user-friendly interface and control scheme make cycling between interactable objects a breeze. Gone is the tedious pixel hunting of yesteryear; now you can flick between points of interest with the shoulder buttons, or reveal everything in the area with a push of the shoulder button.</p>
<p>There's an alternate control system for those who want a bit more of the original's cursor manipulation. Additionally, undocked mode makes full use of the touchscreen. A hint system would have been a good quality-of-life feature, but Simon will occasionally comment on potential solutions.</p>
<p>The hand-drawn artwork is charming, if occasionally clunky. The aesthetic recalls <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_to_monkey_island">Return to Monkey Island</a> in its stylised interpretation of the ScummVM-powered heyday. Animation can feel stiff at times, and when the camera zooms in too close, the art does not always hold up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>That being said, Simon the Sorcerer: Origins is a solid return for a beloved series, and the developers at Smallthing Studios seem more than capable of carrying on these magical adventures.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/simon-the-sorcerer-origins]]></content:encoded>

<p>Paws for thought</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch eShop is home to its fair share of cosy cat games, but in how many of them is the cat a cute little postie? Do we hear 'gap in the market'?</p>
<p><strong>Catto's Post Office</strong> is coming to fill that exact niche. This one arrived on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2908050/Cattos_Post_Office/">Steam</a> back in August, and publisher Cult Games has today announced that it is pouncing onto the eShop on <strong>2nd December</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll make this clear right from the jump: Catto's Post Office is a <em>little</em> game. Sitting at around one hour in length, this isn't going to be the kind of every-evening cosy experience that you might get from others in the genre, but it sure as hell looks cute.</p>
<p>In it, you play as Catto the Postcat, going about a day's work delivering mail to a quaint little village. Catto has a tiny hat and a postbag. He also wears a sweet little button-up shirt. <em>Still</em> not sold? There's a dedicated meow button, <em>and</em> you can knock over pots. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Here's a look at the game's key features and a few screenshots from the publisher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>● Charming Open World: Explore a vibrant cat-themed town with buildings you can enter, such as a bakery, a florist, and a café. Admire the whimsical theming, such as pawprints on doors and cat-shaped rubber duckies, and see what easter eggs you can discover. (For example, there are only cat-friendly plants and flowers in town!)</em><br>
<strong>●</strong> Deliver Packages and Make Friends: Make deliveries around town and meet eccentric kitty residents as you go. Assist your new feline friends by completing silly tasks and unravel funny conversations with multiple dialogue choices.<br>
<em>● Everybody Wants to Be a Cat: Meow whenever you want! Hide inside boxes! Knock over plant pots, cans, and even more besides! Did we mention you can meow whenever you want? Seriously, meow whenever you want. (Meow.)</em><br>
<em>● A Wholesome Narrative Adventure: It’s Catto’s birthday and nobody’s remembered - oh no! Be whiskered away by this heartwarming tale about a hardworking Postcat who learns just how valued he is by the friends he helps every day.</em><br>
<em>● Short and Sweet: Taking only 1 hour to complete, this is the perfect snackable experience to snuggle up with for a cozy evening this winter!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like it sticks to the cosy formula that we all know so well, and we're far from being short of cat games, but come on, it sure sounds like a cute way to spend an evening in the run-up to the holidays.</p>
<p><em>Will you be adding Catto's Post Office to your Switch cat catalogue in December? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>
