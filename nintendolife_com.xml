Yes, really. On 26th February 2026, ConcernedApe's monumental farming sim will turn a decade old. It came to Switch in 2017 and, in the time since it's release, has sold millions of copies and has consistently received a number of big free updates, with the next one — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">update 1.7</a> — on the horizons.</p>
<p>And, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">IGN</a> ahead of the game's big birthday, Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone gave us a little tease of what to expect from the upcoming update, and they're related to children and marriage.</p><div><figure data-videoid="r3KMxc-vq0o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr3KMxc-vq0o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed35e359pxirkg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Barone admitted he's "trying to not reveal too much because I like for it to be a surprise", but allowed himself to slip in a few little details into the chat: "Well, there is a popular fan request, which has to do with the children, trying to make the children a little more interesting."</p>
<p>Right now, children don't really have a function in the game — they're key to getting the Full House achievement, and you get some extra dialogue with your spouse, but that's about it. Perhaps we'll be able to talk to them more or maybe they can help on the farm when they're old enough. Who knows!</p>
<p>But long-time fans will also be excited to know that Barone is going to be "adding two more marriage candidates, but I'll reveal who it is on the anniversary day." There are currently 12 marriage candidates in-game, so this will bring up the list of eligible bachelors to 14. And of course, there are no gender restrictions here, either.</p>

<p>Of course, those aren't the only two things coming with update 1.7, which Barone also teases: "...there's a lot of other things in the update as well that no one's really asked for, but I think people will appreciate it."</p>
<p>Sounds like we'll find out a little bit more — at least on the marriage candidates — on 26th February, then! Perhaps we'll get an update on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">Switch 2 Edition patch and European release</a>, too.</p>
<p>Make sure you give <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">the full interview a read</a> for some lovely little tidbits about Barone's time developing the game, including how he comes up with ideas, his love of David Lynch, and the fact there's still a secret no one has discovered in-game.</p>
<p>Barone also mentions his next game, <strong>Haunted Chocolatier</strong>, which last week <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/i-am-not-going-to-abandon-haunted-chocolatier-concernedape-responds-to-fan-concerns">he had to calm fears about 'abandoning"</a> due to the long development time.</p>

<p>Not so black and white</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're suckers for a good murder mystery game with a funky visual style, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/posthumous_investigation">The Posthumous Investigation</a> looks like exactly that.</p>
<p>This is an upcoming noir thriller from developer Mother Gaia Studio and publisher CriticalLeap, where you'll be trying to solve the murder of Brás Cubas in 1937 Rio de Janeiro. The catch is that you're caught in a time loop, and will have just one day to get to the bottom of things before everything resets.</p>
<p>The thing that immediately caught our eye with this one is the black-and-white visual style, which lends the whole thing a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_of_the_obra_dinn">Obra Dinn</a>-esque noir flair that we can't help but enjoy. And with 14 different suspects to follow around the loop, we're anticipating more than a few "a-ha" moments to keep the dopamine levels high.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens, courtesy of CriticalLeap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Client is the Victim:</strong> Investigate a murder where the only witness is the ghost who hired you.<br>
<strong>Master the Loop:</strong> You have one day to solve the case, but infinite chances. Learn the routines of 14 distinct characters, shadow them through a stylized 1930s Rio, and use knowledge from previous loops to unlock new dialogue paths.<br>
<strong>A Living Literary World:</strong> Inspired by the biting satire of "The Brazilian Shakespeare," Machado de Assis, the game offers a witty, morally ambiguous narrative where no one—not even your client—is completely innocent.<br>
<strong>True Deduction:</strong> No hand-holding. Use your "Thinking Board" to physically connect clues, reconstruct timelines, and identify the killer through pure logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one arrives on PC at the end of March, and the dev has confirmed that a Switch version is "to follow". Hopefully we won't have to wait too long to see what it's all about.</p>

<figure data-uuid="8dfe57f054943"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Ruff" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8dfe57f054943/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-ruff.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>2026 marks 40 years of the <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> series, a staggering achievement for one of the RPG genre's biggest and brightest. Known for its cosy atmosphere, warm character, humour, and iconic art, Dragon Quest is due a big year, and Square Enix is kicking things off with a brand new "reimagining" — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined.</a></p>
<p>Bringing what is regarded as one of the longest RPGs of the PlayStation era to Switch 1 and Switch 2, Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined has attracted joy — and a few raised eyebrows — for streamlining events and making a few tweaks to the game. What was a 100+ hour experience (or 70-ish-hours on 3DS) is now much leaner. So, how to you retain the magic when you're trying to appeal to new audiences, but make sure that old fans are satisfied?</p>
<p>We had a chance to ask the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, a few questions about the upcoming reimagining — which, for the record, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">we absolutely loved</a>. Ichikawa has worked on the Dragon Quest series since 2018, starting out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> as an assistant producer.</p>
<p>As a long-time fan of the series, we asked him about his experience with the original PS version, what changes were difficult to make, and whether the team got to share their work with the series' artist, the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Before we dive into Reimagined, can you share with us the first time you experienced Dragon Quest VII, and what you thought of the game - PlayStation or 3DS version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeshi Ichikawa, Producer of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined:</strong> I was in the lower grades of elementary school when I first played the PlayStation version. I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?” and I don’t think I managed to clear the whole game back then.</p>
<p>When I played it again as an adult, I was able to complete it successfully, and I found the dark world filled with irrationality especially striking and modern.</p>
<figure data-uuid="84316e918d5fb"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84316e918d5fb/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>There’s a lot of pressure to keep the traditions of Dragon Quest intact while modernising certain aspects. How do you juggle those expectations with a game like Dragon Quest VII Reimagined?</strong></p>
<p>As a major title with a passionate fanbase, there was certainly pressure. However, the excitement of being able to deliver this beloved franchise in a way that feels fresh outweighed it, and I believe we were able to enjoy the development process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Having worked on previous Dragon Quest games before in various different ways, how different is it working on a remake like Reimagined to say, a mainline entry such as Dragon Quest XI or a spin-off like Dragon Quest Builders 2?</strong></p>
<p>In a remake, we believe it’s essential not only to offer players a fresh experience but also to preserve the charm of the original version. Striking the right balance between these two is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Given that it’s a big year for Dragon Quest in 2026 with the 40th anniversary, why is this year the right time to return to Dragon Quest VII? And why kick off the celebrations with this one?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past originally released in 2000 - so this year is its 26th Anniversary! Because of this, we felt it was the perfect time to bring its storytelling and unique atmosphere to a wider audience - especially now, in today’s world.</p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined not only “reimagines” the story and emotional portrayal of its characters but also makes the game significantly more approachable and accessible. We believe this game will be enjoyable for both previous DRAGON QUEST VII players and newcomers alike!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6e3829828eaf"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6e3829828eaf/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What attracted you to the diorama style that’s used in Reimagined? Why did you decide to go with something completely different, as opposed to the HD-2D style used for Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest I &amp; II?</strong></p>
<p>The original DRAGON QUEST VII was defined by Akira Toriyama’s designs, featuring charming, stylized characters. We considered how to convey that cuteness while still capturing the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the same time, we discovered that movies and games featuring doll motifs were well-received globally, which inspired us to combine this concept with DRAGON QUEST VII’s character designs. We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to the visual expression seen in the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama. However, as mentioned earlier, we kept in mind throughout production that the visual style needed to match the charm of his adorable illustrations.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Quest is usually known for being lighthearted and charming – at least, it always feels very cozy to us! But Dragon Quest VII is often considered one of the darker entries. How do you balance this and do you make any changes in Reimagined to lean more one way rather than the other?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is a work whose appeal lies in two aspects: the irrational and dark scenarios encountered throughout the journey, and the exciting coming-of-age story of an ordinary boy growing into the savior of the world. This title preserves that appeal while reimagining it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8152e720c2622"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8152e720c2622/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You’ve talked about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">streamlining the game’s narrative</a> and the discussions you had on which scenarios you wanted to keep, rather than get rid of. How tough was it to cut the sections you eventually settled on, and do you have a favourite that was a must-keep for the final game?</strong></p>
<p>We felt that reimagining the scenario was necessary to create a more fast-paced and immersive narrative experience. Throughout the process, we consciously made adjustments to ensure that the original version’s unique atmosphere and core story remained intact.</p>
<p><strong>If you were to sum up Dragon Quest VII Reimagined in one sentence (or one word if you want a challenge), what would it be?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title allows you to experience the irrational nature of the world and the exciting story of growth that lies beyond.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, to wrap up this interview, what does Dragon Quest mean to you? And how will you be celebrating the 40th anniversary?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is the story of the growth of a boy from humble beginnings, and I hope that, through developing this title, I too have grown. I would be delighted if this game could serve as the beginning of delivering a wonderful 40th anniversary celebration of DRAGON QUEST to everyone.</p>

<p><em>This interview has been slightly edited for clarity and flow.</em></p>
<p>Thank you to Ichikawa-san and the team at Square Enix for making the time to speak to us.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined launches on Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>. Will this be your first time playing the game, or did you play it on PlayStation or 3DS? Let us know down below!</p>
