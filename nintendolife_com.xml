<p>According to director Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, he thought that the seventh entry <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/resident-evil/resident-evil-7-was-possibly-too-scary-and-some-people-couldnt-handle-it-says-director-koshi-nakanishi-and-thats-why-resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-mode-to-make-it-slightly-easier-to-deal-with/">might have been a bit too scary for some</a>. As such, he decided to implement a third-person perspective into Requiem to potentially dial down some of the terror.</p>
<p>In an interesting new development, however, it seems that recent experiences demoing the game at both Gamescom and TGS reveal that Japanese players and Western players have different preferences.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kzhruw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250929d" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denfaminicogamer</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiem-devs-notice-japanese-players-are-more-likely-to-play-in-third-person-westerners-in-first-person/">Automaton</a>), Nakanishi speculates that Western games have a tendency to prefer the first-person perspective due to growing up with FPS games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/doom">DOOM</a>. Japanese gamers, on the other hand, will have spent more time with third-person games like <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn't an exact science, of course, and Nakanishi also thinks that because younger gamers in Japan are playing more first-person games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, the general trend may start to shift. As for us, we're of the mind that third-person Resident Evil games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">RE4</a> are generally more enjoyable than the first-person outings.</p>
<p>But what about you? Do you have a preference? Or will you try both and see which one resonates more? Let us know by voting in the below poll and leaving a comment.</p>

<figure data-uuid="36287598ec7cb"><a title="legend of Zelda weapons toy set" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36287598ec7cb/legend-of-zelda-weapons-toy-set.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The fantastic character designs of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda</a> series have always lent themselves very well to amiibo, toys, and all of that sweet merchandising action that we all seem to love very muchly. Big muchly!</p>
<p>Now, Bandai Candy Toy has announced a set of ten collectible, fully-licensed Legend of Zelda weapons, which we love the idea of because, hey, the weapons in these games deserve a whole lot of love too.</p>
<p>Currently slated for release late February 2026 in Japan (cheers to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tokyogamelife.bsky.social">@TokyoGameLife</a> for the heads-up), the dinky box set recreates Link's Hylian Shield, Master Sword, bow, and a bunch of other iconic weapons from the most recent games in the series, in cute, palm-sized, miniature fashion. Heck, each one even comes with its own little stand and everything.</p>

<p>We've had a little browse around this morning, and the collection is out of stock on most hobby shops that ship worldwide already, so you may need to have a proper search if you are interested, and the price has been varying thanks to pre-order offers, between around $30 - $40 (before taxes and delivery costs) or whatever that translates to where you are.</p>
<p>Here's some more details and pics from Bandai (via <a href="https://hobby-genki.com/en/candy-toy-bandai-shokugan-bandai/63956-the-legend-of-zelda-weapon-collection-10pack-box.html">Hobby-Genki</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>・1 Pre-painted Miniature Figure (9 possible types)<br>
・1 Dedicated Display Base (engraved with title logo)<br>
・(Master Sword only) Additional support stand for pairing with Master Sword (Sheathed Ver.)<br>
・(Sheathed Master Sword only) Additional display base<br>
・1 Soda-flavored gum</p>
<p>Lineup (9 Types)<br>
1. Master Sword<br>
2. Hylian Shield<br>
3. Royal Claymore<br>
4. Zora Longsword<br>
5. Seven Jewels Dagger<br>
6. Great Eagle Bow<br>
7. Stonecrusher<br>
8. Lightscale Trident<br>
9. Rare: Master Sword (Sheathed Ver)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>Now, to think of a target small enough to neutralise with a pocket Great Eagle Bow.</p>

<p>Before this one can blast onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong>, Nintendo has served up the game's pre-order goodies on <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fkirby-air-riders" rel="sponsored noopener">My Nintendo Store UK</a>. As standard, the listings include a small bonus for <em>all</em> pre-orders and the option to upgrade to a 'bundle' for more merch.</p>
<p>We'll start with the standard option. All My Nintendo Store Air Riders pre-orders (<strong>£58.99</strong> for digital, <strong>£66.99</strong> for physical) will come the <em>exclusive</em> Kirby Air Riders Reusable Cup. That's right, <em>it's a cup</em>. It's adorned with pictures of Kirby, Dedede, Chef Kawasaki et al, and it can hold a whopping 350ml of your hot beverage of choice.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Is it the most mind-blowing addition out there? Absolutely not, but we suppose it's roughly on par with the usual keychains and microfibre cloths included in these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bundles are a good bit cuter. Upping the price to <strong>£70.99</strong> for a digital copy and <strong>£78.99</strong> for physical, these also throw in a Kirby plushie to sweeten the deal. There are three different plushies to choose between — Warp Star Kirby, Sleepy Kirby and Ultra Sword Kirby — and all are available for the same bundle price on the MNS website.</p>

<p>Both the bonus cup and plushie bundles can now be pre-ordered from the My Nintendo Store UK website, though the extras will only be sticking around "while stocks last", so make sure to get in there quickly if you have a particular purchase in mind.</p>
