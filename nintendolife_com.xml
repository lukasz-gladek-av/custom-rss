<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161545/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>For serious petrolheads, the Switch 1 wasn't exactly a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/burnout_paradise_remastered">(Burnout)</a> paradise platform. In fact, given the size of the console's library, there's surprisingly little in the way of even semi-serious racing sims for those looking for more than kart racing, smaller-scale experiences that hone in on one aspect and expand (such as the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/art_of_rally">art of rally</a>), or more general arcade fare (like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hot_wheels_unleashed_2_turbocharged">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/horizon_chase_turbo">Horizon Chase Turbo</a>).</p>
<p>These are all great games, for sure, but even now, with the Switch successor nearly eight months into its life, what are we looking at in terms of sim-styled stuff? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rush_rally_3">Rush Rally 3</a> and its follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rush_rally_origins">Rush Rally Origins</a>, perhaps, but precious little. 2019's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> still stands out, though.</p>
<p>I know, Codemasters' 2014 racer (brought to Switch by Feral Interactive) isn't really a sim either, not purely, but it's a different level of racing experience to the others I've mentioned. You can have a big, serious career across multiple disciplines, and so it's a game that comes as close to the likes of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_motorsport">Forza</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/gran_turismo_7">Gran Turismo</a> as you'll currently get on a Switch. Indeed, it's the most impressive racing game port I've played on the console, giving you the full-fat package of single-player content to race through local and online multiplayer was added in post-launch updates), and with no major performance issues to speak of. It also looks great, even now.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161546/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now 2022's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends</a>, the most recent series entry, has landed on Switch 2 and it's brought all the same graphics options and tweakable bells and whistles as its impressive predecessor — more about those in a bit — whilst also upping the ante in terms of the depth and scope of its solo content. Nice! However, does it have the bleedin' multiplayer at launch this time?</p>
<p>No, it doesn't. And whilst, yes, it's a shame, I have to say, as someone who owns this game on other platforms, you're not missing much. At all. In fact, given that online leaderboards <em>have</em> made the cut here, I'd go so far as to say you've still got the best and cleanest multiplayer element intact. It's unclear if multiplayer might be patched in later, like its predecessor.</p>
<p>However, Legends <em>is</em> aiming to please primarily by bringing narrative aspects and solo content to the fore. It feels like that rare sort of racer that's been made with single-player racing fans in mind, in fact. Its story and campaign modes are where it sings, mixing a little light drama with racing that can, and does, get fairly explosive on the regular. Also, this Deluxe Edition lands with all previously-released DLC, meaning there's loads more to dig into in these modes.</p>

<p>Let's talk about the handling of the cars. The Grid games hit my own personal sweet spot (most of the time) for controls in an arcade-sim/simcade style. It immediately feels very satisfying to put your boot down and tear up a straight; to drift ferociously through corners or handbrake at the last second into a hairpin and swing your back around, ready to rinse and repeat step one. If you've played any modern arcade racer, you're immediately comfortable, and this game feels as good as any of its peers when you're on the track. In fact, I've been on a bit of a racer kick lately, and I can say that this one easily beats out <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/need_for_speed_heat">Need For Speed Heat</a></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/need_for_speed_unbound">Need for Speed Unbound</a></strong>. Both lovely games, but this one wins on controls, it wins on content, and it wins on giving solo players loads that they'll feel the need to speed into. (Thank you.)</p>
<p>Now, let's reverse a bit, because I mentioned controls and whilst for some, the lack of a multiplayer suite will be the primary annoyance, it's Nintendo's choice of digital triggers on the Switch 2's controllers that bothers me most for this type of experience. It's not a complete killer, not at all, and I'm sure you've had plenty of experience with it in the past, but it's going to be an issue for some finesse fans who don't want to start considering new control setups or tweaking in order to attain the level of throttle control they enjoy.</p>
<p>Of course, and you'll know this if you've checked out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-with-analogue-trigger-compatibility-that-work-with-the-gamecube-nso-controller">recent guide to Switch 1 and 2 games with analogue trigger support for GameCube controllers</a>, you <em>can</em> also use your snazzy NSO GameCube pad to override this issue and enjoy the wonder of technology that's been around since the late '90s. With the GC controller plugged in, the game shines all the brighter.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161538/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I do also think, on balance, that the lack of analogue triggers on the default controllers isn't quite as important as it could have been. There's no way you're getting me around Monaco in an exacting F1 game with digital triggers, for example — I'm crashing 1000 times on the first bend — but it works fine for what's presented here.</p>
<p>Onto the modes on offer, and Grid Legends brings lots to the table. Besides the main story mode, which I'll get to in a bit, we've got a career that's split up over four unlockable levels, starting with a rookie program and ending in a gauntlet of pro challenges. With a total of nine disciplines to try to master, from touring and electric cars to open-wheeled vehicles, trucks, and high-performance GT stuff (my favourite), there are 128 motors and 137 track routes set in 22 different locations here. Yes, I did say it's a meaty one.</p>
<p>Free play mode then gives you single player quick races, single race events and custom cups for you to set up at your leisure, whilst Dynamic Events mode, as I briefly mentioned earlier, allow you to pit your online times against others via leaderboards.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161539/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the main course, that is the game's 'Drive to Glory' story mode, this roughly seven-hour affair sees you rise up the ranks through events and trials in a tale that's as rote as they come, but it does have an ace up its sleeve! And that ace, my friends, is live-action acting for the cutscenes and all the main parts of rival racers and team members, making for some utterly hammy, totally unnecessary, and really, actually, quite fun cutscenes.</p>
<p>I also vastly prefer the overall style of how this stuff gets delivered here; dropped in casually and quickly as we set up for races and arrive at paddocks, and so on, rather than cutting away for big chunks. It gives you a story, and it keeps you near to the action at all times. So, if you feel like the narrative aspects <em>might</em> get in the way of racing, fear not, as it's a well-balanced thing, and having voices and faces for opponents sure does bring a new level of competitiveness on the track, too. <em>"I really hate that guy!"</em> you'll scream as you ram into their car and make an enemy, or a 'rival', as the game labels it.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161540/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, the racing here once again incorporates the Grid series' slick nemesis system, and it's been improved in Legends, making for some seriously dirty races as you start to make <del>enemies</del> rivals who'll then make sure to get payback by spinning you out on a corner or shunting you at the worst possible moment. I love it, and you can toggle off the rough stuff if you're not a fan, as there are difficulty levels for everyone to enjoy here and options galore.</p>
<p>Speaking of options, this one has got all the graphics modes found in GRID Autosport. So, you've a choice between "Graphics" and "Performance" in TV mode (30/60fps, respectively). In handheld, we get both performance and quality as above, with the addition of a "Balanced" mode and a "Battery Saver" mode.</p>
<p>I've been messing with all of these and the visual quality mode, whilst fine, isn't worth the sacrifice for how smooth performance feels at a solid 60fps. I'll also say I've been pretty blown away by how great the performance mode looks on a big TV screen. There's no need to worry about awful textures and image quality at all with this, it looks fab.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161541/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In handheld, I've landed on the balanced mode after lots of experimenting. It feels that bit smoother than quality and looks sublime on the console's little screen. There are also options to turn on or off enhanced visual effects and to reduce rain intensity, so plenty to muck with, and the game delivers top-notch, highly enjoyable and responsive racing on the go as a result.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you can make peace with a lack of multiplayer outside of online leaderboards, alongside the fact that digital triggers aren't ideal if you're after precision throttle control (grab a GameCube NSO pad to swerve this issue), Grid Legends on Switch 2 serves up an excellent package of slick and satisfying 'simcade' action that looks and plays wonderfully well in both docked and handheld.</p>
<p>With lots of options in terms of graphics and accessibility, and all previously-released DLC included, this is easily the best racing package of this type that's currently available on either of Nintendo's Switches and a real blast for solo racing fans.</p></section>

<p>Fur real</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Raptor Claw's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron">FUR Squadron</a> rather proudly wore its <strong>Star Fox</strong> inspirations on its sleeve when it flew onto Switch back in 2023, and its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fur_squadron_phoenix">FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>, isn't shying away from things either.</p>
<p>This on-rails space shooter arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>25th February</strong>, and it looks every bit as McCloud-ian as we'd hoped. There's a crew of fluffy pilots, nimble space ships, an interplanetary "system" under threat from an evil force — yeah, this is Star Fox.</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, however, there's a certain psychedelic sheen over the whole thing that stops FUR Squadron from feeling like a complete retread of things we've seen before. With neon visuals, CRT scan lines and mech battles (!!), there's a pretty intriguing vibe under all of the familiarity.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A roguelite campaign where every run reshuffles the levels, keeping the action fresh and unpredictable.<br>
- Upgradeable ships, unlockable weapons, and skill trees that let you craft your own path to becoming an ace pilot.<br>
- Massive bosses, dynamic environments, and intense battles across space, air, and sea.<br>
- A dazzling arsenal: unleash power beams, multi-missile barrages, and even a nuke strike. Forget the basics—this is war with style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raptor Claw claimed that the game was heading to Switch 2 last year, shortly after the console's first tease reveal, and while it will certainly be playable on the new system, Switch 1 owners won't miss out. Based on the studio's reply to a comment on the above trailer, FUR Squadron Phoenix has been designed for Switch 1, but will see "boosted performance" on the new hardware.</p>
<p>With Nintendo showing no sign of releasing a new Star Fox game anytime soon, we'll be relying on projects like this to fill the Lylat-shaped hole in our hearts.</p>

<p>Celebrating the "first look" at Yoshi</p>

<p>Last weekend, Nintendo aired a special Direct presentation for its upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a>, which is due out in cinemas this April.</p>
<p>This particular clip focused on Mario's pal Yoshi, who will join the crew in this new adventure, which takes place across all sorts of familiar locations. To celebrate this big reveal, Nintendo and Illumination have now released a new promotional poster, and it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, here's a look. As you can see, it shows Mario actually riding Yoshi:</p>
<figure data-uuid="8c1b96029652a"><a title="The Super Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c1b96029652a/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-a-new-movie-poster">promotional poster released in November</a> last year featuring Mario and Luigi in what appeared to be the Sand Kingdom from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. This looks to be the same location in the new trailer where Yoshi is discovered.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen the new trailer, be sure to check it out in our previous post. This latest update from Nintendo and Illumination also notes how the movie's release date has shifted "in the US and many additional markets globally" and is now releasing at the very beginning of April.</p>
