<figure><a title="Age of Calamity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7aab1096cbe2/age-of-calamity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One pleasant surprise of the Switch 2 launch, beyond the advertised upgrades — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free and otherwise</a> — to various Switch games, has been seeing how <em>some</em> Switch games that once struggled to hit their frame rate targets have gotten a nice boost on the new console.</p>
<p>It seems that Switch 1 games with unlocked frame rates are getting a largely untouted bump in the performance department, with games like the nigh-on unplayable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> — which we called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/batman-arkham-knight">"one of the worst ports we've ever played"</a> — now becoming a viable option on Switch 2. Loads times have also shot down for some titles. Result!</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Here, we've collected 13 examples which have impressed us. Some were fairly miraculous on Switch to begin with, but Switch 2 is making a bunch of the bad ones good (or at least playably stable!) and some of the great ones shine brighter than ever. Let's jump in, in no particular order...</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories!</a> My god, I love this game. However, it was a bit of a mess, a bit of a *bunch of swear words* if i'm being honest, on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Back at the release, our review said, <em>"From a technical perspective, the Switch port of Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories is an absolute mess. Narratively and artistically, however, it’s one of the most fascinating games in recent memory."</em> Correct.</p>
<p>Now, though, thanks to Switch 2, from what I can see, the game runs flawlessly. And you need to play it. Now, I'm not gonna pretend I know exactly what the numbers are here, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're looking at an uncapped frame rate that's lifted the action right up to around the 60 mark. It feels great. It also looks much clearer. I think a replay is unavoidable. Sorry. <em><strong>- PJ</strong></em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I fired <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> up and dove into one of the EX missions and...blimey. Essentially, it now has the performance you always wanted from the game. I played a mission and tried out the two-player splitscreen and didn't note a single dropped frame.</p>
<p>Granted, its original state, while hitchy, didn't massively affect my enjoyment of the game. Of course, I saw it — you couldn't miss it — but I still very much enjoyed my time with it (RSI notwithstanding).</p>
<p>Now, I'm not going to play through the entire thing hunting frame rate dips, but after firing it up again for the first time in several years, I'd absolutely consider it if the backlog didn't just have two dozen Switch 2 games piled on it! <strong>- <em>GL</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3 (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a> is an incredibly ambitious, bombastic game that definitely struggled in places on Switch 1 as a result. It looks fuzzy when playing handheld and the accompanying frame rate rarely hits its 60fps target.</p>
<p>Moving over to Switch 2, the game still kind of looks like arse in handheld mode, and it'll likely take a proper 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' upgrade to change this. The frame rate, however, is now buttery-smooth throughout. There's not a single drop below 60fps, from what I've played, even during the busiest set pieces.</p>
<p>For me, the last mainline entry in PlatinumGames' flagship series has its downsides, but if performance was one of them for you, then you can feel comforted in the knowledge that this has been completely rectified for Switch 2. Oh, and load times are now much zippier, too. Nice. <strong>- OR</strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Booting this horiffic mess up for this article,...I'm now impressed? Sort of.</p>
<p>There's no doubting that the move to Switch 2 has benefitted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Arkham Knight</a> immensely with regards to its frame rate, which is now super smooth — even whilst driving Batman's car. I can't remember what it's called...the Bat Car? Anyway, you can barrel through the streets now and it's all good.</p>
<p>And so it goes in combat. It now feels very smooth, and even spinning the camera around Gotham City as you glide through the sky causes no stutters or anything. Miraculous. Or it would be if they could fix the resolution, which is rough in places.</p>
<p>However, if you only have this one way to play Arkham Knight — or it came in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Arkham Trilogy</a> and you abandoned it — it's good to know this version now runs well enough, besides some fuzzy visuals. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Oh, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU</a> is so lovely. If you haven't played this delightful little 3D platformer yet, then now is the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p>On Switch 1, Bakeru's frame rate was kind of all over the place at times. You could tell it was gunning for that 60fps sweet spot, but it never even came close to hitting it. On the Switch 2, it's a completely different story.</p>
<p>I felt like I was playing a remaster when I booted it up for the first time on Nintendo's new console. The frame rate is absolutely spot on, and it really helps elevate the incredible art design and animations. This is up there with some of Nintendo's best. Get on it. <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I'm gonna be blunt now. I hated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> on Switch. I know, I know...it was a miracle port. Whatever. I couldn't handle the muddiness, the sluggishness, and the draw distance that gave me a headache outside of towns. It just wasn't viable for me. I'm a pig.</p>
<p>And so, I'm very pleased to announce that, having taken so poorly to The Switcher, the very same game on Switch 2 is one I'd happily go on a date with. I might even pay for the food. Switch 2 makes the game look night and day different. It's really crisp and clear and, even with all the graphical excisions, manages to look quite purdy, especially while galloping (unfettered by flailing frames) across the game's glorious countryside.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpn5-Ifk27k">Yep, the frame rate feels slick as hell now, too.</a> The Witcher has gone from struggling to run, to feeling as though it needs a bespoke patch to unleash its full powers on a machine that can handle it. For now, though, it's a bloody nice, free little boost. Ta. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I was super-hyped for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a> on Switch (massive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/castlevania">Castlevania</a> fan detected) and even decided to make that my platform of choice for the game.</p>
<p>Whilst it was okay, in a pinch, there was a big loss in terms of visual fidelity, and frame times were all over the place, leading to juddery, unsatisfying play. It just wasn't a <em>grea</em>t version of what is a great game, put simply. However, on Switch 2, any frame time issues have been sorted, with a fully solid lock to 30fps (yes it's not 60, but it's smooth and maybe we'll get a patch).</p>
<p>It's also just a much nicer game to sit down with, thanks to more responsive menu navigation and loading times that have been squashed right down to a breezy minimum. If the game had arrived on Switch like this, I probably wouldn't have double-dipped. Not bad! <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Compared to other series entries, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> wasn't quite as rage-inducingly bad in the performance department, but as highlighted by Alex in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rwJk2nz_xcA?si=Mqsb70rP8ZKf9sbp&amp;t=1071">a recent live stream</a>, the game is now rock-solid, stable 30fps for anybody playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say that Arceus is some bastion of graphical prowess or anything, but if the frame rate drops bothered you before, they've been zapped on Switch 2. The Pokémon Company let everyone know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> were getting an update, but don't forget this winner, too. <em><strong>- GL</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, despite being utterly incredible, definitely had its drawbacks on the Switch 1. Load times were pretty dire, and even just heading into the pause menu would yield some unsavoury slowdown.</p>
<p>Not so on the Switch 2. Here, everything is as slick as you could possible hope for. Transitions from one area to the next are pretty close to instantaneous, and heading into the pause menu now has absolutely no slowdown whatesoever.</p>
<p>These hardly sound like the most enthralling improvements ever, I know, but with some like Disco Elysium — a game that utterly demands you to pay attention — seeing all these little improvements add up makes for a much more enjoyable experience. <strong><em>- OR</em></strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM 2 Collection (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM 2 Collection</a> is a game that I awarded an 8/10 to when it released on Switch, and I stand by that score, as bringing a game of this depth and size to a dinky little console, and in a form that played well enough, was very obviously a huge undertaking. And Firaxis managed it - albeit with some big concessions.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, while the graphics remain downgraded (for now), the game now runs buttery smooth, meaning that it's now a viable way, <em>a fully enjoyable way</em>, to play this timeless collection of strategy classics in portable mode. Get in. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

</div></div><hr>
<p><em>Elsewhere, we can confirm that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> got a nice bump to stability (although it still looks a little rough in places), and there are plenty of other games we're keen to test, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156735/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Listen. I'm not gonna dive into this review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on Switch 2 with any ideas of pretending to know everything, or even understand anything, about a game that's grown from hastily retooled battle royale to...well...it looks kind of like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/roblox">Roblox</a> now, in all honesty. What on earth is going on here?</p>
<p>Yes, since the last time I launched into a game of Epic's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, it's changed, I think it's fair to say, <em>immeasurably.</em> The menu system that you boot into is incredibly confusing if you haven't been keeping up with the changes, and looks exactly like the mess of game modes, fan content, and madness I watch my sons syphon through on a daily basis in the Roblox Corporation's behemoth.</p>
<p>Fortnite, it seems, has evolved into something of a lifestyle choice, and it's attracted all the big brands. Hey, there's LEGO, that's cool to see. And over there are lots of licensed superheroes in the main battle royale mode, there's a music festival going on, and there's even some sort of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a>-type racing thing happening. It's a lot. And, even though I may sound a little dismissive, it's actually all very impressive.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156739/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Epic has the mega-bucks to make things happen, you see, and it shows. All of the various games here are decently entertaining, great at times even, and they are collected together in such a way that it all feels, I'm sure, as though you are socialising in effect, dropping in and out of game types with your pals and getting chaotic on the mic. Again, it's basically turning into Roblox, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>This is all much slicker, though. You can feel the money in the bigger games, and even the fan stuff is much better. Hopping between games is fast and breezy now, too, and so there's always something, whether official or fan-made, to take for a spin without having to worry about a sluggish port making it much slower than it need be.</p>
<p>Let's dig in, just a little, to the core modes involved for those who are new to this 2016 game, or platform, such as it is these days. You've got the super-solid battle royale that started it all (pour one out for Save the World), seemingly available here in a few seasons at once, with superheroes and some classic older stuff all there to cycle through. It may have been around for aeons now, but honestly the building element to this — where you erect makeshift walls and platforms on the fly — just never really gets old, and having this one mode running smoothly on Switch 2 is probably enough for some to make it worth the download.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156743/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's <strong>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</strong>, a fully fleshed out survival game that's managed to stick around and remain popular for quite some time (full transparency, I've been very excited by what I've played of this so far) alongside <strong>Lego Brick Life</strong>, a sort of multiplayer social-sim deal where you can probably spend hundreds of hours making an apartment just how you like it in a big Lego city full of other people.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Harmonix gets involved with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, which is a full-on rhythm game featuring rotating song selections, a song shop, and the choice to take control of one of four instruments in each song, meaning multiplayer is a go-go. What I played was, like everything in Fortnite, surprisingly in-depth and fully-featured, so I can imagine it's good fun with some pals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_racing">Rocket Racing</a>, meanwhile, is genuinely a pretty great online 12-player racer (by Psyonix!) that does a great job of giving you a fast-paced, flashy and very moreish arcade experience replete with everything from boost pads to drift techniques and more besides.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156740/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>These offerings are the main pillars within the Fortnite zeitgeist at the moment, with all the other good stuff just gravy. You've also got a huge creative suite which has been powered up and added to over time, resulting in a flexible system that enables gamers to make impressively varied content, some of which is actually very decent - from the little I've tried.</p>
<p>There's freeze-tag games, co-op horror efforts, a Minecraft clone (which seems good?!), BMX games, sports stuff, sci-fi adventures and a game which I will even mention by name here, Octo Game, which is basically <strong>Squid Game</strong> online. Nice.</p>
<p>I'm sure none of us need a 46-year-old nerd's in-depth thoughts on every last one of the game modes and fan content bits and bobs here; we all know what Fortnite is and how it plays across the various aspects that have been added to it over the past few years. It's also <em>free</em> — the microtransactions, although annoying in quantity, are purely cosmetic, so ruining yourself financially is entirely optional — so I guess there's no loss to just jumping in and giving it a whirl.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156737/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the big question. How does it play on Switch 2? Well, it's all very good news. Looking back on the original Switch version now, after years of iteration and several console launches, it really is a bit of a muddy, depressing mess. We all put up with it, because we're hard-as-nails gamers, but as soon as you make the leap to Switch 2, there's no turning back.</p>
<p>The blurred visuals have been eradicated to the point my son is happily playing it in docked mode on a big TV and thinks it looks "great". This coming from someone who baulked at the idea of just <em>looking</em> at the Switch version is surely a very good sign.</p>
<p>In both docked and handheld mode you are now getting 60fps and it looks way, way sharper. Resolutions, I believe, have jumped from 900p/660p (or thereabouts) for docked and handheld respectively on OG Switch — both of which were 30fps — to 1220p/900p at 60fps on the Switch 2. Result!</p>
<p>Geometry looks far more impressive, with way more detail and sharper, cleaner edges and textures have seen a big old boost all-round. Foliage has also returned to the map in the form of lots of lovely trees and details, an aspect which looked AWFUL on Switch 1 as you departed the Battle Bus and landed down onto a barren wasteland. Here it looks great. Is it as sharp as a PS5? Of course not. But it looks very nice, especially in handheld, and there have been no issues across any of the game modes as far as I have experimented. It's 60fps all the way, baby.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156744/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of the modes themselves, just very quickly, I still love the main battle royale/building mode of this game. It's just very smart, and one of those timeless things that draws you in fully every time you return to it. Elsewhere, I have to say, I could also quite easily get fully addicted to Rocket Racing and all of the various Lego stuff is also great. I'd much rather my kids stuck to playing this than return to the dankness of Roblox, in all honesty.</p>
<p>Another cool aspect to this embiggened version of Fortnite, is all of the creative opportunities it offers to players through its various Creative modes. I should also mention that the Lego Odyssey survival/adventure mode absolutely got me hooked. I was not expecting it to be this involving.</p>
<p>Seasoned players will also be happy to hear that loading times are way sharper, and all of your various skins — which on Switch might straight up refuse to load in — now appear in a timely and orderly fashion. Heck, they even look good! These are the sorts of changes that take it from a fuzzy, low-end version, albeit one we put up with on Switch, to an eminently viable experience.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156738/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whilst I've been playing Fortnite on Switch 2, it's also received an update to add mouse controls, and I...love them? I was not expecting to say that. Quite the opposite, in fact. However, the way the game handles it all is very cool.</p>
<p>Hopping into Settings, you can select a hand for mouse control, turning your chosen Joy-Con on its side and using the shoulder buttons as your mouse buttons. Sweet. The other Joy-Con then gets held normally for movement with your thumbstick, and combining these gives you a hybrid setup that feels ace. Yes, you'll need to have a little space to do it, but if you're sitting at a desk (or have ironed your trouser legs), this is now the way. A big surprise, and something that's now got me excited to use mouse controls for shooters on Switch 2 going forward.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156741/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, then, this port may not be quite as slick as your powerhouse PC or Series X variants, which is fair enough and expected, but honestly, if I had to choose a console to go with, it's no longer straightforward. Portable brings <em>a lo</em>t to the table, especially considering the gaming habits of the kids this game is primarily aimed at. I also now love mouse controls.</p>
<p>So, yes, it looks a bit shinier on other platforms, but sitting on the sofa to mess in creative mode, listen to tunes via Fortnite Festival, or get stuck into Lego or battle royale? I'm gonna go ahead and say I'm rocking the Switch 2 every time.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fortnite on Switch 2 fixes all glaring — and not so glaring — issues with the Switch 1 version of the game. This is a huge package of activities; from battle royale to survival game, racing, creative modes, music festivals, and more besides. It's a lot, and it now runs at 60fps with crisp, clean resolutions all round.</p>
<p>Mouse mode controls are a revelation, loading times are hugely improved, graphics look very nice indeed, thanks, and, well, I reckon this is now the best way to play this one, regardless of a slight downgrading in visuals.</p></section>
