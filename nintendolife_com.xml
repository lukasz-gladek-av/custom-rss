<p>Should have stapled some photo credit on there</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Sad DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30f78c9fe1a1d/switch-2-sad-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">reported</a> on a handful of unlucky Switch 2 customers who rocked up to their local GameStop on launch day only to find their console screens punctured by a poorly-placed staple. Keen to escape the hot water that such a fiasco (rightfully) landed the company in, GameStop attempted to make light of the situation with a new advertisement announcing console restocks in its stores, but the joke has only ended up pinning more trouble on the company. <em>Tut, tut</em>.</p>
<p>We'll start with the self-deprecating promo itself. GameStop proudly announced its Switch 2 restocks with the new tagline, "Staples not included". The accompanying picture in the company's <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1934729633393725468">announcement tweet</a> shows a Switch 2 unit suspended in mid-air, with a red stapler brandishing a "Do Not Use On Box" message in the foreground.</p>
<p>While perhaps a bit insensitive to those unlucky enough to land a punctured unit, it's just about self-critical enough that we cracked a little smile when we first saw it. "Fair play, GameStop," we thought to ourselves, "you might just bounce back from this"...</p>
<p><em>Whoops</em>, spoke too soon! As it turns out, GameStop forgot to staple some photo credit to its funny little promo. That cool image of the floating Switch 2? It ain't GameStop's to use.</p>
<p>As pointed out on Twitter by Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/chriswelch/status/1934750202478711084">Chris Welch</a>, the snap was originally taken by photographer Janelle Jones <em>for</em> Bloomberg. It even takes centre stage on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-06-16/nintendo-switch-review-hardware-performance-game-selection-battery-life">outlet's console review</a>, for crying out loud! All GameStop did was crudely edit a picture of a stapler over the OG's dock without credit or mention. You can see it for yourself in Welch's tweet below — <em>spoiler</em>: it's not a good look for ol' GS.</p>

<p>As it stands, the GameStop promo is still live on the store's social media accounts, but we imagine it will only be a matter of time before that quietly disappears from our feeds. <em>Sigh</em>, only GameStop could manage to land itself in more hot water while attempting to make light of a previous slip-up.</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda movie casting rumour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78231f8f0257b/zelda-movie-casting-rumour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you'll undoubtedly know by now, Nintendo's very exciting live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> movie</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">has been delayed</a> by a little bit to a release date of 7th May 2027. Now, that may sound a long time away, but when you're making a huge movie that every gamer and their donkey (Kong?) is gonna be champing at the bit to see, well, that's not very long at all.</p>
<p>So, it may come as no real surprise to learn that the casting process has reportedly gotten underway already. Now, before anyone gets too excited, none of this stuff has been confirmed, so make sure to have a cold drink of water handy as you imbibe the purported facts that follow here.</p>
<p>With that said, <a href="https://zeldauniverse.net/2025/06/17/casting-for-zelda-movie-is-possibly-in-the-works/">and according to Zelda Universe</a>, movie industry insider Daniel Richtman has shared details via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/131325843">his Patreon account (paid)</a>, saying that casting for the roles of Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, Impa, and the King of Hyrule could be taking place right this very moment. We knew we could sense a disturbance in the fo...oh wait, wrong franchise.</p>

<p>Link and Zelda’s casting also, according to Richtman, seems to be focused on performers between the ages of 16 and 23, at least for Link and Zelda. The article also suggests that this casting period could be all wrapped up and done by August this year (I mean, you'd hope so!), so it could very well be that we hear who we've got in lead roles fairly soon. If any of this is even remotely factual!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-zelda-live-action-movie-eyes-popular-princess-pick">Last month</a>, Richtman claimed that Hunter Schafer was in the running and we ran down some of our own picks for people we could see in the principal roles back when the movie was first announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-who-could-play-link-zelda-ganondorf-in-the-zelda-movie-25-actors-who-could-fit-the-bill">in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be no surprise if the actors required are fairly young, as this could end up being a trilogy, so there's a whole lot of years of work ahead for those lucky enough to fill the legendary shoes of the likes of Link, Zelda or indeed everyone's favourite, <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Zill_(The_Wind_Waker)">booger boy Zill</a>.</p>
