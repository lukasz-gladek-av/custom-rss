<p>Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble join the party</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced that it will soon be expanding the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library with a pair of classic 3D platformers.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a> will be added to the service on <strong>17th December 2025</strong> (that's next week!), so expect to see a lot of floating hands/feet with no arms/legs attached to 'em.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1999 by Ubi Soft, Rayman 2 sees you tasked with saving the Fairy Glade from Admiral Razorbeard and his army of robots. There's all of the usual collecting and platforming peril that you would expect from a Rayman title, but we remember having a jolly good time with this one back in the day, and it's always nice to have an excuse to pick it up again.</p>
<p>Ubi launched Tonic Trouble the very same year, and while not quite as beloved as its platforming pal, it brings the weirdness with its story. This one will have you playing as an alien named Ed, who's sent down to Earth to clean up a little supernatural conqueror problem after he inadvertently pollutes the planet's water supply with a strange liquid.</p>

<p>Those with an NSO + Expansion Pack membership will be able to play both of these titles on the service next Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We haven't built that into our deal model"</p>

<figure data-uuid="05cb12ec07ae8"><a title="LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/05cb12ec07ae8/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: WB Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hm, we're <em>sure</em> that we won't be looking back on this quote with a suspicious eye down the line. Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/paramount-makes-rival-bid-for-warner-bros-after-netflixs-usd82-billion-offer-includes-game-studios">Netflix's $82.7 billion acquisition agreement</a> with Warner Bros. Discovery (later challenged by a separate offer from Paramount), Netflix co-CEO, president and director Gregory Peters has said WB Games didn't really factor into the company's decision (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/">Pocket Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">recent earnings call</a>, where Peters and Theodore Sarandos — the other co-CEO — were asked if Warner Bros. assets would "enhance or accelerate" success in Netflix's gaming plans. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space," Peters responded, "we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things".</p>
<p>Peters went on to point out that Warner Bros. has "got great studios and great folks working there," and even noted that its properties have spawned financially successful games in the past. "We think we can incorporate that into what we're offering," he stated, "but just to be clear, we haven't built that into our business model".</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warner Bros. Games includes several big-hitting studios such as NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games and Portkey Games. While the company has been through a rocky number of years following the disappointing performance of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/suicide_squad_kill_the_justice_league">Suicide Squad</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/warner-bros-closes-three-studios-including-team-behind-smash-like-brawler-multiversus">shutdown</a> of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, among other things, there have also been financial successes with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what the future of Warner Bros' game division might be under Netflix, though with Paramount Skydance launching a rival bid of its own earlier this week, we imagine it'll be a while before we hear anything concrete.</p>
