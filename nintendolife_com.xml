<p>Boom, waka-waka!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new pre-order trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> on the Switch 2, confirming that the game will run at 4K/60fps when docked.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if you wish to purchase the game on the Switch 1 for the time being, you can rest easy knowing that a free upgrade to the Switch 2 version will be available when you eventually nab Nintendo's new console. Bosh!</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>18th July 2025</strong>, Shadow Labyrinth represents a radical departure for the Pac-Man franchise, moving the action firmly into the metroidvania genre with dark overtones and spooky creatures. It looks neat! And it'll look even neater at 4K with silky-smooth gameplay.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the general premise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As Swordsman No. 8, awoken by a floating yellow orb, PUCK, on a mysterious planet amidst relics of wars past, you are chosen to become the instrument of its will.</p>
<p>"To survive you will discover many secrets, consume your enemies, and grow from prey to the apex predator as you embrace your true purpose."</p>

<p>Launching this October</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're into games that go hard on frenetic fun and stylish visuals, then you might want to keep an eye on Full Metal Schoolgirl, a new title headed for the Switch 2 from Yuke's, the developers behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earth_defense_force_world_brothers_2">EARTH DEFENSE FORCE: World Brothers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>, Full Metal Schoolgirl takes place within a dystopian Japan, where you must face off against Meternal Jobz, a corrupt corporate superpower. Climbing the heights of an ever-shifting 100-story skyscraper, you'll be mowing down hordes of undead salarymen with massive guns as you work to enact your sweet revenge.</p>
<p>It looks pretty cool; we love the colourful visuals, the awesome enemy designs, and of course, the gigantic weapons. We only hope the gameplay brings enough variety to keep us occupied for the entire runtime, but so far, early impressions are pretty positive.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Take Revenge as a Fully-Mechanized Schoolgirl:</strong> Step into the role of a cyborg heroine armed with an arsenal of high-powered weaponry and cutting-edge mechanical upgrades in this exhilarating action shooter. Infiltrate Meternal Jobz, the world’s most ruthless mega-corporation, and fight back against undead “Working Dead”, the relentless corporate grunts that will stop at nothing to protect their employer. Show no mercy – scrap them all!</p>
<p><strong>- Engage in Close-Quarters Combat in an Ever-Changing Skyscraper:</strong> Enter a towering 100-story skyscraper where the evil CEO awaits on the top floor. Climb higher while navigating an evolving structure as each new run introduces changing layouts and obstacles from its trap-like security system. Own the battlefield to reach the top!</p>
<p><strong>- Fund Upgrades with Live-Streamed Battles:</strong> Use the power of content creation to win the favor of viewers! Obtain materials and rewards by defeating enemies to improve your character and earn donations for upgrades by live-streaming to a captivated audience. As the number of viewers increases, so does the support. Even in the face of defeat, remember you are not alone… the viewers of your livestream are cheering you on!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll have more information on Full Metal Schoolgirl as we get closer to its October release date.</p>
