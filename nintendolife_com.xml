            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>2026 is almost upon us, so naturally, everyone is thinking about end-of-year awards. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">hosted his ceremony last week</a>, and today, it's time for the tech experts from <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/digital-foundrys-2025-graphics-of-the-year-awards">Digital Foundry</a> to get involved, as they run down their best graphics of 2025.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise that the shortlist this year is mainly comprised of titles found on PS5 and Xbox Series, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mafia_the_old_country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> getting their flowers, but a handful of Switch newbies got a nod too.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry dedicated the entirety of its honourable mentions section to the Switch 2 this year, giving a shoutout to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> for "maximising the Tegra T239 in different ways", and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which DF calls "currently Switch 2's best 'impossible port'." The outlet also highlights Panic Button's work on the Switch 1-to-2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Switch 2 is entirely absent from the official top 10, mind you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> lands a spot all of its own, with DF calling Samus' latest "a lighting masterwork - a prime (pun intended) example of how pre-baked lighting inside carefully crafted environments, whether fully indoors or exposed to outdoor elements, can implement attractive lighting phenomena like emissive lighting while also organically leading players."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch 1 version</a> of MP4 even gets a shoutout in the Digital Foundry listing, with the outlet praising how it delivers "so much ecosystem diversity within large exploration zones at a steady 60fps, building upon the already impressive likes of Metroid Prime 1 Remastered to push the 2017 console to its limits."</p>
<p>As ever, Digital Foundry's top 10 is unordered until hitting the top three, with the seven preceding entries sorted alphabetically instead. Here's the full list, as laid out on the Digital Foundry website:</p>
<p><strong>- Dying Light: The Beast</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Earthion</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Ghost of Yōtei</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Mafia: The Old Country</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Routine</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Silent Hill f</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Doom: The Dark Ages</strong></p>
<p>A pretty good year for good-looking games, then! You'll find the team's explanation for each entry either in the video at the top of this article or by heading over to the <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/digital-foundrys-2025-graphics-of-the-year-awards">DF site</a>.</p>

<p>And it's a free upgrade for Switch 1 owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Surprise, folks! Larian Studios has dropped a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>. Oh, and it's out <em>right now</em>, and if you already own the game on Switch 1, you can upgrade for free.</p>
<p>It's <strong>$49.99 / £44.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) on Switch 2. However, if you buy the Switch 1 version and then grab the free upgrade pack, it'll only cost you <strong>$24.99 / £22.49</strong> until <strong>7th January 2026</strong>. So save some pennies and grab the Switch 1 version!</p>
<p>Larian, clearly riding on a high after its showcase for a new Divinity game at The Game Awards last week, are treating fans to a sparkly version of the critically-acclaimed CRPG. We don't know what the Switch 2 Edition adds to the experience besides higher resolutions and a better frame rate; can we hope for Mouse Mode?</p>
<p>Here's a little flavour text about the game, just in case you missed out on this pre-Baldur's Gate 3 classic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of Baldur’s Gate 3, experience the world of Divinity in this epic adventure where your choices shape fate itself.</p>
<p>The Divine is dead. The Void approaches. And the powers lying dormant within you are soon to awaken. Choose your role in a BAFTA-winning story, and explore a world that reacts to who you are, and the choices you make. With five races to choose from, and an adventure playable solo or as a party of up to four, lay waste to an oppressive order in a world afraid of magic. Become the God the world so desperately needs.</p>
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition is the most complete version of the best-selling, Metacritic Must-Play RPG.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The game was already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">brilliant on Switch</a>, so we're excited to dive in and lose another hundred hours to this behemoth.</p>
