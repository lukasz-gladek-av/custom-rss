<p>Punch up, super star!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After being announced for Switch 2 way back in May 2025, SEGA has today revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</a> will mark the series' long-awaited debut on a Nintendo system on <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who have missed the details up to this point, this Switch 2 release features full cross-play, so you can battle it out with pals on other consoles as well as rollback netcode support, balance updates, training tweaks, <em>and</em> new moves and combos to slip into your fighting style.</p>
<p>It serves as a pretty beefy upgrade to the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/virtua_fighter_5">original 2007 game</a>, with the drastically improved visuals showing just how far we've come in the last... 20 years *<em>gulp</em>* R.E.V.O. launched on PS5, Steam and Xbox Platforms back in October 2025, where it went on to pick up some pretty strong reviews — it currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage/">Metascore</a> of 78 based on 15 critic reviews.</p>
<p>If this all sounds very much up your street, the game's Open Beta Test kicks off on 18th February, designed to test "network servers and cross-play performance for the game with the other available platforms," says SEGA. You'll need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to get involved, obviously, but it'll be a good chance to see what the game's all about.</p>

<p>If you're already certain that you're going pick it up, however, then you'll be pleased to hear that pre-orders open <em>today</em>! You can pick up the standard digital edition for <strong>$19.99</strong>, or the digital 30th Anniversary Edition for <strong>$49.99</strong>, which includes all kinds of bonuses like the Legendary and Yakuza DLC packs, the swimsuit costume set, pre-production artwork and more. As with the majority of Sega's Switch 2 output, the physical version is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release"><strong>Game-Key Card</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A physical release of the 30th Anniversary Edition is also available for <strong>$49.99</strong>, including all of the gubbins outlined above <em>and</em> with a double-sided poster to boot.</p>

<p>Stellar job, Frasers Group</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="e149f2fb65f93"><a title="GAME" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e149f2fb65f93/game.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>UK retailer GAME has reportedly filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators in a clear sign that the firm is once again on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/frasers-owned-game-retail-signals-it-s-on-the-brink-of-collapse">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/eastmidlands/news/2106649-frasers-owned-gaming-chain-hits-pause-and-alerts-administrators">The Business Desk</a>, GAME – which is owned by Frasers Group – has appointed law firm RPC to oversee the 10-day protection period from creditor action while it considers any potential next steps. What those steps might be at this stage is unclear.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time GAME has fallen into administration – it happened before back in 2012, resulting in the closure of 277 stores in the UK and 2,104 job losses. You might remember shortly before this that several major game publishers refused to provide stock for GAME, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mass_effect_3">Mass Effect 3</a> being a particularly high-profile release that simply wasn't available at the retailer.</p>
<p>Private equity firm OpCapita purchased GAME one week after it fell into administration, subsequently selling the business to Frasers Group in 2019. Since then, standalone stores across the country have been closing down in favour of concession stores within Sports Direct. Additionally, GAME no longer stocks pre-owned games, and its reward scheme has gone the way of the Dodo.</p>
<p>To cap it off, the Basingstoke Head Office fully closed down in 2025.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on how things pan out with GAME over the coming days and weeks, but we're not wholly convinced anybody is going to be keen on saving it this time around. Nothing would thrill us more than to see GAME pulled from the brink and transformed into a thriving specialised retailer that stocks unique, bespoke physical games. But that's probably wishful thinking at this stage.</p>

<p>The Direct showcased a bunch of fun features that we can expect to find in the slice-of-life sequel, including a huge number of character customisation options, personality quirks, more design possibilities than we ever thought possible, and <em>Hugh Morris</em> — the jolly jester from the trailer that we're now campaigning to get in Smash Bros.</p>
<p>And yes, it'll all be compatible with Switch 2. Whether there are any bonus features on the new hardware remains to be seen, but hey, we're excited!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mysloj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
