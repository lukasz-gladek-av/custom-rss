<p>What could it mean?</p>

<figure data-uuid="27deebf30322b"><a title="Persona 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27deebf30322b/persona-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/persona_5">Persona 5</a> originally released in Japan in September 2016, which means it's been nearly a <em>decade</em> since the latest mainline entry first hit shelves. Fans are exceptionally eager to see what <strong>'Persona 6'</strong> might look like, and according to a brief tease from the franchise's <a href="https://asia.sega.com/p30th/en/">30th anniversary website</a>, we might not be waiting too much longer to get our first glimpse.</p>
<p>As covered by our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/persona-anniversary-site-mentions-next-chapter-for-the-series">Push Square</a>, the Google link to the 30th Anniversary website includes a short snippet of information that reads: "Come celebrate the journey as we usher in the next chapter for the series."</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that this could be referring to the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> which, at the time of writing, has not yet been confirmed for the Switch 2. That seems a little odd though, right? To us, "the next chapter" is more likely a reference to the inevitable brand-new game which, unless something drastic happens, is likely to be called Persona 6.</p>
<p>But still, we're not going to get <em>too</em> excited for the time being. It's a really small piece of information and we think it would be a remarkable coincidence if a Google description was our first official indication of Persona 6.</p>
<p>Atlus will no doubt have much more to say as we work our way through 2026, so we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
