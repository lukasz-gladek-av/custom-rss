<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bfb83ae6aa66a/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Surprise! Nintendo has announced that it will be holding a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct on <strong>19th August 2025</strong> (that's tomorrow).</p>
<p>The announcement was made via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, where we learnt that the showcase will kick off at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT/ 3pm CEST</strong> and will last for... wait for it... <strong>45 minutes</strong>. When you consider just how much content Nintendo packed into the 15-minute <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> presentation, this is a <em>long</em> one!</p>
<p>You can find the precise time that the event will get underway in your region below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>If that wasn't enough Kirb for ya, the official <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders" tabindex="-1">@KirbyAirRiders</a> X account has also popped up today, sharing a tweet which declares itself <em>the</em> place for Air Riders updates.</p>

<p>Air Riders was revealed at the Switch 2 Direct earlier this year, hyping us up nicely with Sakurai's involvement and a 2025 release window. We've seen and heard nothing since, so there's plenty to look forward to tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>Will you be tuning in for this Direct? Ride down to the comments and let us know.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/28109af8836b2/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo first-party releases keep coming, and the first of two for August has wheeled onto the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has been out for a few days now, and it has proven to be a divisive one.</p>
<p>Pairing up wheelchair basketball with the Joy-Con 2's Mouse Mode, we actually had a fairly good time with Drag x Drive, with the wonderful PJ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">scoring the game a 7/10</a>. The core gameplay? Good, and surprisingly deep. But outside of online matches and a few minigames... there's not much in the package. But it's on the cheaper side, at least.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186124 @ 1755521429 -->
<p>At the time of writing, the game is currently on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/">62 Metascore, which is "Mixed or Average"</a>. So it seems like this one might have missed the basket for many.</p>
<p>We know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree's Switch 2 Edition</a> are still relatively fresh, and we still have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>'s big Switch 2 upgrade to come, but we imagine some of you have been shooting hoops with friends. So we want to know what you think of the game.</p>
<p>You can score Drag x Drive between 1-10 here or on the game page whenever you fancy; if you've spent lots of time with it at the weekend, you're probably ready, but need more time on the court? That's okay too, come back later.</p>
