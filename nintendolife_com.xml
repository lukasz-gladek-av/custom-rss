<p>Save the date, bub</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> will launch on the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>22nd May 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The new sequel, developed by Fabraz (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>) will also get a 'Pawsome Edition' physical release on both consoles, containing the game itself, a deluxe box, a poster, an artbook, and a manual. Atari is seemingly implying that, much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, the physical release on Switch 2 is <em>not</em> a Game-Key Card but rather a full on-cart release.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, a digital copy of Bubsy 4D will set you back <strong>$19.99</strong>. The physical edition on Switch is <strong>$39.99</strong>, while the release on Switch 2 is <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, I’m on a mission to take back the Golden Fleece from those nasty BaaBots who snatched it right out of my paws. I’ll run, jump, glide and roll across alien planets with platforming purrfection, tackling vibrant fabric- and craft-themed levels, with each planet ending in a BaaBot boss battle. Dress me up in stylish new outfits, collect hidden blueprints to unlock new moves and race against other players’ ghost data in online time trials. Along the way, I’ll reunite with furmiliar friends like Terri, Terry, Virgil and Oblivia - all to a pawsitively funky soundtrack by Fat Bard."</p>

<p>Bubsy has had his fair share of criticism in the past. Most recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> received a score of 4/10 from us earlier in 2025, in which we described the included games as being "frustrating and painful to play".</p>
<p>With Frbraz at the helm, however, we're confident Bubsy 4D will be much better.</p>

<p>Kiki's Bakery Service</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Silver Lining Interactive and developer Sunny Lab are bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchs-bakery">The Witch's Bakery</a> to Switch 2 in addition <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witchs_bakery">to Switch</a>, with the cosy RPG arriving on both consoles in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine opening a bakery in modern-day Paris — not easy, right? Well, as Lunne the witch, that's exactly what you're doing. But this slice-of-life adventure is more than just making Mont Blancs and macarons; being a witch, Lunne has the ability to see inside people's hearts and heal their emotions. Anyone getting some <strong>Kiki's Delivery Service</strong> vibes from the premise alone?</p>
<p>The game is split into three parts — during the day, you're running your bakery, fulfilling customer requests and managing a small group of staff. In the evening, you get to explore Paris, make friends, and also solve problems by using Lunne's aforementioned magical ability. At night, you can decorate your bakery, practise your magic skills, or just relax.</p>
<p>And all of these activities get your experience and money, as well as build relationships and make new friends. But Paris is also home to many shops and unique districts, so make sure you spend time running around the most beautiful city in the world.</p>

<p>And goodness, somehow we haven't talked about the beautiful hand-drawn visuals yet: The Witch's Bakery looks gorgeous, with 2D character models that look like they've come straight out of an anime on 3D-esque backdrops. Paris has never looked more stunning, we think.</p>
<p>In addition to a digital release, Silver Lining has also confirmed it will be releasing a physical version for both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — the latter appears to be a Game-Key Card — for <strong>£29.99 / $34.99 / €34.99</strong>. Pre-orders are opening now <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/search?q=the+witch%27s+bakery&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">on Silver Lining Direct</a>.</p>
<p>We know there's a lot of cosy games on Nintendo's consoles, but the visuals and unique mix of gameplay elements make The Witch's Bakery stand out to us. It looks lovely, and we can't wait to see more later in the year.</p>

<p>Out alongside Meetup in Bellabel Park on Switch 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> is coming out very soon — as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-arrives-on-switch-2-in-march">just announced</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> — but that's not the only upgrade coming to the 2023 GOTY-nominated platformer.</p>
<p>Three brand new amiibo will be released on the same day as the Switch 2 upgrade, <strong>26th March 2026</strong>. The line-up features Elephant Mario, Poplin &amp; Prince Florian, and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower. Yes! Captain Toad <em>finally</em> has an amiibo!</p>
<p>Prices haven't been announced yet, but given the increase as of the Switch 2 generation, they'll likely be on the more expensive side. Here's a little look at them:</p>

<p>What do they do in-game? They'll give you free power-up items if you scan them in while you're in any course.</p>
