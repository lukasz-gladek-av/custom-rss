<figure><a title="Yakuza 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ea2b376ca9e9b/yakuza-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gosh, can you believe it's already been over two weeks since the Switch 2 launched? Where does the time go?</p>
<p>Alas, it's true, but this week brought even more news with the big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Direct</a>! It revealed a boatload of new information and made many of us here at NL <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025">infinitely more excited for its release next month</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 also got its first big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">stability patch</a>, which is nice, and it's also been reported that third-party launch games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">didn't sell quite as well as publishers would have hoped</a>, despite the Switch 2 getting off to a roaring start.</p>
<p>With reviews this week, we've covered off the following:</p>

<p>Now, it's time to kick back and relax with some games, so let's see what we're up to this weekend...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:183939 @ 1750496404 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I finally picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> last weekend and have been enjoying noodling around the past couple of evenings. I’m only an hour or two in at this point and it’s yet to really get its hooks in me, but I’m sure a good sesh this weekend will help that along a bit.</p>
<p>I’m also really fighting the urge to replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> after that Donkey Kong Direct. Maybe I’ll just hop in to mop up a few more moons… maybe…</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>If you'd have told me that my most-played games on the brand-spanking new Switch 2 would be GameCube titles, well... yeah, I would've believed you. I love that I can just whip out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> while my daughter watches utter rubbish on TV.</p>
<p>I am, however, putting quite a few hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>. I must admit, I've been struggling to really settle on something now that most my launch review responsibilities have been fulfilled, but Yakuza really hooks you from the start, and I'm really enjoying my time with it. It looks great and runs like a dream.</p>
<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p>While at times lately it feels like my brain is slowly mutating into a Switch 2, I’ve not had as much time as I’d like with some of the games I’ve been most looking forward to on it. I’ve played so much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> though, lemme tell ya.</p>
<p>Life gets complicated sometimes, but this weekend sounds like it’s gonna be easy! So that means I’m diving headfirst into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. The music, the characters, the combat! Ugh! I’ve already played Chapter 1 and 2, but with 3 and 4 now available, I’m planning to refresh myself with a new playthrough because my brain is mush and I don’t remember as much as I’d like…and I also want to relive those silly moments with Lancer and Spamton!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'll be chipping away at Cyberpunk and otherwise scanning my library and making space for some more kid-friendly fare ahead of a family trip (in addition to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">51 Clubhouse Games</a>' ever-reliable Ludo board, natch).</p>
<p>Despite not being truly grabbed by Free Roam in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, I'm still dipping in now and then to explore, so it must be doing <em>something</em> right. A little more of that too, then. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a> is proving to be quite a good surprise on Switch but most of the weekend will be spend in the streets of Kamurochō. I would probably be far more advanced plotwise in Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut if I did not stop to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/out_run">OutRun</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> every time I pass by the arcades, not even mentioning the bowling alley, the Shogi club, the Mahjong club, the batting center… yeah, now I remember why I kept postponing getting into SEGA’s flagship series: These games are made to keep you constantly distracted while having a fine time while at it. Also, what is up with this clean cut, civilised Goro Majima!?</p>
<p>Meanwhile on PC, having terminated (ah) my first time campaign playthrough of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/terminator_resistance">Terminator: Resistance</a> (a brilliant game I missed upon release) I am quite keen to at last start up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>. You know the drill: my generation was brought up on these movies and we are now living in a distant future where video game technology allows us to "live out" these franchises via our joypad. Sadly, we do have to buy them for way more than a dollar.</p>
<h2>Ken Talbot, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm still spending time in Night City and marvelling at the performance on my undocked Switch 2.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I’ll be revelling in the utter chaos of online Mario Kart World, including the great new knockout mode, which is both infuriating and humbling.</p>
<h2>Michelle See-Tho, Contributor</h2>
<p>Instead of getting Switch 2, I’ve gone back a few consoles and am playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">Pokémon SoulSilver</a> on DS. It’s so much fun seeing the series in its heyday (it’s literally the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1750503536509000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AEl_TN9xdMpQgSA-5fkRV" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time">number one rated game here on NL</a>). The little puzzles, the fun characters, the many many mechanics… They don’t make ’em like this any more.</p>
<p>Other than that I’m cosying up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a> – a slightly more recent classic.</p>

<h2>Tom Massey, Contributor</h2>
<p>Being unable to get in on the Switch 2 right now I’m doubling down on my Switch 1, and going firmly old-school with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>.</p>
<p>I’m working on a long-time-coming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_castlevania_iv">Super Castlevania IV</a> one credit clear, and I was so close on my last attempt I’m already haunted!</p>
<h2>Ethan Zack, Contributor</h2>
<p>It’s another heaping plate of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut for me this weekend. After years of wanting to jump into the franchise but feeling a tad overwhelmed by the scope of it all, I figured that this enhanced port launching next to Switch 2 was as good of an opportunity as I was going to get.</p>
<p>I’m having a blast working my way through the story but, man, I can feel the other games I need to play piling up as I sink hour after hour into this one. Some days I don’t even make progress — I just play darts for an hour, eat a burger, and then go on some insane side quest to beat up a cult leader. In the words of one Frank Reynolds, <em>“Oh my god…I get it.”</em></p>
<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm writing in from Singapore, where, sadly, the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to go on sale. I'm woefully behind the curve but hopefully, by this time next week, the next-gen Ninty console should already be in my hands.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fantasian_neo_dimension">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, the latest from <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The game's diorama-style landscapes look incredible on the Switch OLED, and the battle system offers a unique twist on turn-based combat. I have a deep reservoir of nostalgia for PlayStation-era Final Fantasy, and this scratches the itch for what it's worth. So I'll be chipping away at that until my Switch 2 arrives, and then it'll finally be time for Mario Kart World. Better late than never.</p>
<h2>Nick Ransbottom, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm still wrapping my head around playing Cyberpunk 2077 in the palm of my hands so I'll be making my way through Night City this weekend while cozied up in bed.</p>
<p>I'll also be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. And if I have time, I'll finally be starting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>.</p>

<p>Fans are already calling for a Switch 2 port</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Lies of P" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24c2c3299b595/lies-of-p.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It's been a difficult year for the video game industry at times, but there are still plenty of success stories out there and the latest one is a sales milestone for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studio.</p>
<p>While we don't have anything to report here about a Switch 2 release (<em>at least for now</em>), according to South Korean publication <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec (via VGC)</a>, Korean publisher Neowiz is rewarding every member of the local development team with Nintendo's brand-new system after the success of the new DLC 'Overture' and more than three million cumulative sales.</p>
<p>It doesn't end there, with the team also getting launch bonuses (of roughly $7,300) and two weeks paid vacation on top of the country's "mandatory 15 days of paid vacation". And hey, there's all that time to enjoy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and many other games!</p>
<p>Sure enough, this news has resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lg3ono/lies_of_p_devs_get_bonus_paid_holiday_and_switch/">Switch 2 and Nintendo fans calling for a port</a>. The action RPG with "soulslike" elements launched on platforms like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as well as the next-generation systems in 2023, so maybe there's a chance. For now, soulslike fans with a Switch 2 can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> as well as FromSoftware's new multiplayer game.</p>
<p>When this game was originally released on the PS5, our pals at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p"><strong>Push Square</strong></a> awarded it eight out ten stars – calling it a "first-class" souls-like experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lies of P feels like the result of a developer having already taken multiple stabs at the Souls-like genre, so it's impressive that Round8 Studio has accomplished so much on its first attempt. By fully embracing its dark take on the Pinocchio story, it sets itself apart from anything else available. Elevating it above other games are quality combat and extensive, satisfying customisation, turning Lies of P into a first-class experience for FromSoftware fanatics."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, this isn't the only team to be gifted Switch 2 recently, with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/stellar-blade-dev-says-nothing-confirmed-regarding-switch-2-port-rumours">Stellar Blade studio Shift Up</a> also handing out the new Nintendo system to its employees.</p>

<p>"Put the pedal to the metal"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're a racing fan and are looking for something else to play on the Switch 2, you'll pleased to hear <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> is now compatible on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>Developer Feral Interactive has provided an update on the state of the game – confirming it's now ready to race on the new hardware. There was apparently an "issue that was blocking startup" that's now been resolved in the latest Switch 2 firmware update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feral Interactive:</strong> "Switch 2 racers rejoice! The high-octane thrills of GRID Autosport are now playable on your shiny new console! An issue that was blocking startup has been fixed by the new Switch 2 firmware update, so grab yourself the latest version and put the pedal to the metal!"</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="PH9AJiL5EQ8" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PH9AJiL5EQ8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>The eShop game page for GRID Autosport includes the following notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Updated 06/19/2025 - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>

<p>GRID Autosport originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">made its debut on the Switch in 2019</a>, with a multiplayer update patched in at a later date. While the performance was already decent on the Switch, the experience should be even more enjoyable on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This is one of many third-party Switch titles to benefit from Nintendo's latest firmware update for the Switch 2.

<p>According to updated listings, Nintendo has been able to work its magic and reduce the game's file size from 10GB down to 8.5GB. It's not all that much, but given the size of various other titles on the Switch 2, we're sure many users will appreciate the extra space.</p>

<p>C'mon, Square Enix</p>

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XVI" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01c7eb5647920/final-fantasy-xvi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has supposedly hinted at bringing its latest mainline <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy</a> game to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1936193603837346175">'Genki_JPN' on social media</a>, during a <a href="https://youtu.be/Zg-LRoukGVo">live stream broadcast</a>, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a></strong> producer Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) and creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro briefly touched on the game's future and how Nintendo is the only platform left to conquer.</p>
<p>It's led to plenty of speculation online, with <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/page-3">some Final Fantasy fans already convinced</a> a "Switch 2 port" could be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Before anyone gets too excited, Square Enix's current focus is on bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Intergrade</a></strong> to the Switch 2 this Winter. The tactical RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> is also scheduled to arrive in September.</p>
<p>Following its PlayStation 5 and PC release, Final Fantasy XVI was made available on Xbox Series X|S earlier this month and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/according-to-sales-estimates-final-fantasy-16-had-a-rough-first-week-on-xbox">it's got off to a rough start (in terms of sales)</a> as highlighted by our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This apparent tease follows on from Yoshi-P previously mentioning how a Nintendo release of Final Fantasy XIV Online <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">could be on the cards</a>. For now, though, nothing has been officially announced or confirmed about either of these Final Fantasy games coming to Nintendo's platforms.</p>

<p>See you next time</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> made its debut on the Switch 2 earlier this month and now that chapters one to four are available, you might be wondering when the next one drops.</p>
<p>Well, it seems the end credits of the fourth episode have confirmed chapter 5 will be arriving in <strong>2026</strong>. There's no specific date attached to this release window, but it's scheduled for some point next year. So, there you go!</p>

<p>Deltarune originally debuted on the Switch eShop as a free download in 2019 and in a development update last December, creator Toby Fox mentioned how the fifth chapter was making "steady" progress.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this '2026' release sticks and we see the next chapter arrive within its scheduled window. We should also have a Deltarune Switch 2 review going live here on Nintendo Life at some point in the future, so be on the lookout for that.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
