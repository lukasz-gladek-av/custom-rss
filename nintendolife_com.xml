<p>This year's event kicks off at <strong>5pm PST / 8pm EST / 1am GMT (Fri) / 2am CET (Fri) / 10am JST (Fri)</strong>, though, as ever, a pre-show 'Opening Act' will begin half an hour before that — and you can expect to see some awards given out there too.</p>
<p>Here's the precise time that you'll be able to tune into the Opening Act in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 4:30pm (Thu) PST / 5:30pm (Thu) MST / 6:30pm (Thu) CST / 7:30pm (Thu) EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 12:30am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 1:30am CET / 2:30am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 9:30am JST / 8:30am AWST / 11:30am AEDT</li></ul>

<p>Normally, TGAs aren't packed with Switch news, but there are a lot of big hitters we enjoyed on Nintendo consoles this year up for some headline awards. We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> all up for GOTY, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is in the running for a few trophies too.</p>
<p>There's every chance that we'll hear some third-party Switch 2 news from this one, too, with the fresh hybrid still very much being the new kid on the block. Don't go expecting anything from Nintendo itself, but an announcement of a port or two might be on the cards.</p>
<p>Whatever the event throws our way, we'll be here to watch along with you. You can watch the full event — from the Opening Act right up to the final award — and have a natter while you do it, below.</p>
