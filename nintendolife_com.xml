It still has the accursed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-avoid-blue-shells">Blue Shell</a>, of course, which you can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/yep-it-looks-like-you-can-still-dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world">thankfully dodge</a> if you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>This weapon has been ruining friendships for years and is one of the many tactics the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-kart-games-of-all-time">Mario Kart series</a> employs to avoid having a single player dominate the race. When used, it dashes to the front of the pack and takes out the lead driver, evening the odds.</p>
<p>However, have you ever wondered what would happen if you throw a Blue Shell when <em>you're</em> in the lead?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no more, as it has been revealed:</p>

<p>This isn't a new feature, as many of you Mario Kart veterans will be aware—the Blue Shell can be the cause of amusing 'self-owns' in other entries in the series, as you'll see in the video below.</p>

<p>Still, it's fascinating that I haven't even tried this in all the decades I've been playing Mario Kart games, and I started right at the beginning because I'm an old fart.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's news to you, too? Let us know with a comment.</p>

<p>It's now the third best-selling Street Fighter</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Akuma" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08ac9e4439953/akuma.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250611.html">has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over <strong>5 million units</strong> since its initial release in 2023; a milestone helped considerably by the recent release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>This makes it the third best-selling Street Fighter game of all time at the time of writing. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a> is currently in the lead with a total of <strong>7.8 million sales</strong>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter II</a> for the SNES sits at <strong>6.3 million</strong>.</p>
<p>The company states it "aims to maximize the game’s userbase" by bringing the game to the Switch 2, and has helped to facilitate this by including cross-play, an initiative that allows players to join online fights across multiple console platforms.</p>
<p>The game hasn't arrived without some controversy, however. Like many third-party releases for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/street-fighter-6-somehow-combines-game-key-card-and-code-in-a-box-on-switch-2">Street Fighter 6 is a Game-Key Card</a>, meaning users will need to download the title from the eShop despite owning a cartridge.</p>
<p>The additional content for the Years 1-2 Fighters Edition also isn't included in the download as standard, but rather via a separate code. It's due to expire in two years too, which means that those who buy the 'physical' release at some point in the latter half of 2027 and beyond won't get all of the content advertised.</p>
<p>Capcom has also confirmed that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/capcom-is-recording-switch-2-game-key-card-purchases-as-digital-sales">considers sales of Game-Key Cards to be digital sales</a>, which honestly makes sense since users are downloading the game from the eShop.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, Street Fighter 6 is a damn good fighter for the Switch 2. We're not all too keen on the exclusive like gyro controls, but the core gameplay is excellent. We awarded it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">well-deserved score of 9/10</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of "raw computing power", that is</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 / Xbox Series S" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d9e139a3bed6/switch-2-xbox-series-s.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>They say that comparison is the thief of Joy-Con — or something along those lines — but ever since Switch 2's reveal, people have been clamouring to work out how Nintendo's latest matches up against the other consoles on the market. Before launch, the tech experts over at Digital Foundry suggested the console was roughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">in line with Sony's PS4</a>, but Koei Tecmo has recently estimated that it might be even beefier.</p>
<p>That is according to producer Takuto Edagawa, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/">wccftech</a> about the upcoming Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts S</a>, estimated that Switch 2 might be closer to the Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power" than Sony's last-gen system.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power, so it's difficult to generalise," Edagawa told the outlet, "but I think it can be thought [of] as closer to the Series S".</p>
<p>We suspected that Switch 2 would never be able to stand toe-to-toe with the likes of the PS5 and Series X, but hearing that developers understand it to be roughly in line with the Series S proves that there has been a pretty substantial upgrade under the hood — as if the promise of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> wasn't proof enough.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the wccftech interview, Edagawa revealed that the team has not used NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution for the Switch 2 version of Wild Hearts S, though they <em>did</em> implement HD Rumble 2 to achieve "more nuanced vibration without additional costs for adjustments".</p>
<p>Wild Hearts S arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>25th July</strong>, bringing the Monster Hunter-style adventure to the Nintendo hybrid with more beasts and modes, GameChat implementation, and a new four-player multiplayer option.</p>

<p>Game-Key Card releases have been a huge talking point in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 – arguably blurring the lines between physical and digital media.</p>
<p>Now that Nintendo's new system is out, it seems Capcom has revealed how it will be reporting game-key card sales. This information comes from a financial briefing Q&amp;A summary, and it's been confirmed the Japanese company will treat game-key cards as "digital sales".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. Are key cards for Nintendo Switch 2 (game cards that feature an activaition key necessary to launch the software) recorded as physical or digital units?</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jpylkr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>A. They are recorded as digital sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's that – game-key cards are classed as digital media by Capcom. It follows a story last week about how publishers are actually thanking Nintendo for this new option, as many companies face "rising costs to make games".</p>
<p>Capcom last week released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 as a game-key card release, and while it comes with all of the Year 1 and Year 2 DLC, this part of the game is actually a download code. So the main game is on the game-key card, but you'll still need to input a code on the eShop to access the DLC.</p>
<p>If you were to end up giving away this card in the future, it seems the next user would then have to repurchase the game's DLC.</p>
