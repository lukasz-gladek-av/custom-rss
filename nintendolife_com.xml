<p>Meta turns its back on VR</p>

<figure data-uuid="591af6eaee4a3"><a title="MP3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/591af6eaee4a3/mp3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Armature Studio, a development team primarily focused on creating VR titles, has been shut down by Meta.</p>
<p>Originally founded in 2008 by ex Retro Studios developers Mark Pacini, Todd Keller, and Jack Mathews, Armature has primarily worked on ports, starting with the PS Vita version of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/metal_gear_solid_hd_collection">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</a>.</p>
<p>It soon ventured into the world of VR and was acquired by Meta Platforms in 2022, a company that, at the time, were very keen to put all of its efforts into the metaverse. Now that tech bros around the world are obsessed with AI, Mark Zuckerberg has seen fit to steer away from VR.</p>
<p>The result is the closure of three key VR studios: the aforementioned Armature Studio alongside both Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. Overall, around 10% of Meta's Reality Labs division has been laid off.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope the folks at every studio affected find their feet in due course. Heck, maybe Retro Studios can snap up Pacini, Keller, and Matthews again..? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>The wording of this agreement suggests the movie will be available for physical and digital purchase following its cinema run, before moving exclusively to Netflix's subscription-based streaming platform.</p>
<p>The movie is a co-production with Nintendo and is scheduled for global release on May 7th, 2027.</p>

<figure data-uuid="a9036198f3f22"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9036198f3f22/animal-crossing-new-horizons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, the time is finally upon us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> is now available in its swanky new Nintendo Switch 2 Edition package!</p>
<p>While the free ver. 3.0 update arrived a little earlier than expected for <em>all</em> users (Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2), yesterday marked the big release of Nintendo's latest paid Switch 2 upgrade. This one includes a resolution bump, the new Megaphone item, Mouse Mode integration, and beefed-up online capabilities to make the most of GameChat.</p>
<p>It's something of a slight package, considering there's no free path between the two (it'll only set you back £4.19 / $4.99 to upgrade, but still), and that was our Alex's biggest gripe in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">6/10 review</a>. "It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features," he wrote, "but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196240 @ 1768586314 -->
<p>But of course, this is Animal Crossing: New Horizons that we're talking about, perhaps <em>the</em> defining game of the Switch generation, so we want to hear what you think too.</p>
<p>Whether you've spent the whole day getting to grips with the latest addition to the NS2E lineup, or you're just diving in for the first time, you can tell us what you make of the upgrade in the following poll. And don't worry if you want to change your mind later on, you can come back whenever and do exactly that!</p>
