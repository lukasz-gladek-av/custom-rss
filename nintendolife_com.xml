Fortunately, Level-5 dug deep and was able to <em>finally</em> release the title on the Switch and Switch 2 in November last year.</p>
<p>It's already getting some updates (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/inazuma-eleven-victory-roads-second-major-free-update-kicks-off-this-month">with more to come</a>), but that's not all - with the Level-5 president and CEO Akihiro Hino mentioning how he's already started writing the scenario for a "sequel" to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road. Yep, you read that correctly! We've even got a little detail about it.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ozvnhl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the rundown from the latest <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/level-5-president-akihiro-hino-has-begun-writing-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sequel">Ina-Dai broadcast via Gematsu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akihiro Hino:</strong> “As for the sequel to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, I have already started writing the scenario. As a ‘new Inazuma Eleven‘ that begins in the Reiwa era, I will do my best to deliver surprise and excitement to everyone once again. Please look forward to future announcements.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source also notes how "despite its recent release, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road was announced in July 2016-during the Heisei era. The Reiwa era began on May 1, 2019".</p>
<p>It's worth noting how the Level-5 CEO previously mentioned how a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-final-trailers-ending-theme-song-music-video-and-latest-details">"potential sequel" would support</a> the "Player Bank" data from this current release. Of course, this "sequel" could still be years out, and it isn't exactly uncommon for developers within the games industry to jump straight into the next title like this (or even have some sort of overlap between projects).</p>
<p>Still, we're <em>almost</em> exhausted just hearing this, as it took so long for Victory Road to arrive on the Switch - with multiple name changes and revisions along the way (with the latest one taking place in 2022), and the game also launching on the Switch 2 in the end.</p>
<p>For now, fans of the current release (<em>that's Victory Road</em>) can look forward to the second major free update, which will roll out on <strong>28th January 2026</strong>. You can find out a little more about this in our previous story here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d264bf87b4d78"><a title="Ubisoft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d264bf87b4d78/ubisoft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>A week after we heard about Ubisoft's closure of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-starts-the-new-year-with-a-studio-closure-71-jobs-affected">mobile game-focused studio Ubisoft Halifax</a>, news has now surfaced about the third-party publisher laying off people at two other teams as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>According to a report from IGN, Ubisoft "expects 55 jobs" to be impacted at the Swedish Studios Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm following a voluntary leave program in fall 2025 that apparently fell short of its target.</p>
<p>Massive is known for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/division_2">The Division</a> and Ubisoft Stockholm has been working on an <a href="https://stockholm.ubisoft.com/">unannounced (and new) IP</a> as well as cloud computing technology.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6EOKFq0qA_o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6EOKFq0qA_o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60cf74xtgoih&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the lengthy statement from Ubisoft, highlighting these studio restructuring measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ubisoft:</strong> Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructure that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.</p>
<p>This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.</p>
<p>These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.</p>
<p>The long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged, and we will continue to serve as the global home and lead for to The Division franchise, move forward with an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup, and play a central role in the development of Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect inline with local regulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development on The Division series is still expected to continue "as a matter of priority", and as noted, the "long-term direction" for both of these studios "remains unchanged".</p>
<p>The Malmö-based developer Massive also happens to be behind the Snowdrop engine, which powered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - a game released on Switch 2 last year.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d9aa83d04068b"><a title="It Takes Two" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9aa83d04068b/it-takes-two.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA, Hazelight Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Electronic Arts has been in the headlines for all sorts of reasons over the years, but Hazelight Studios founder and director Josef Fares (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2021/01/josef_fares_blasts_xbox_series_naming_convention_as_a_total_fking_mess?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">who is known for expressing his honest opinion</a>) can't help but feel the third-party video game giant is still "getting more s**t" than it deserves.</p>
<p>His team's award-winning games (including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> and more recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>) have been backed by EA and during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/i-dont-see-ai-taking-over-split-fiction-director-josef-fares-on-the-rise-of-ai">same interview</a> with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">Christopher Dring at The Game Business</a>, Fares took a moment to defend the company - acknowledging how it's actually been a "super good collaboration" between the two parties, even if it hasn't been completely perfect at all times.</p>
<p>He goes on to state how every publisher has its moments, while calling out Nintendo and the other two major players in the console industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Josef Fares:</strong> “Let’s be honest, there’s not a publisher in the world that hasn’t f*****d up now and then. Sometimes I feel that EA is getting more s**t than they deserve. I mean, come on, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, everybody’s done something that’s not good. But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite EA being labelled a "bad guy", Fares insists there are still "a lot of great people at EA" and they know how Hazelight operates and respects this. He adds how he's "surrounded" by people at EA who "love games" and it doesn't feel like he's with a bunch of corporate suits. And if the situation does ever change, Fares says he's got no worries because Hazelight will always do "what it wants".</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the Hazelight founder's thoughts, he's also shared his opinion on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/i-dont-see-ai-taking-over-split-fiction-director-josef-fares-on-the-rise-of-ai">the future of AI in games</a>. And as for his work, his studio's latest release Split Fiction was one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Switch 2's launch titles</a> last year.</p>

<p>We'll take some patch notes now, Aspyr</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="735044a1074d8"><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/735044a1074d8/tomb-raider-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Aspyr, Crystal Dynamics</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the surprise release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch and Switch 2 last November, Aspyr said it would continue to update the Nintendo versions with patches over time to provide the "best possible experience for all players".</p>
<p>With this in mind, it seems an update has been recently released, bumping the game from Version 1.0.1 up to <strong>Version 1.0.2</strong> (thanks for the heads up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/canaryfarmer" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Life user canaryfarmer</a>). The official patch notes don't appear to be available just yet, but this hasn't stopped fans from investigating what's changed.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q8cbzf/update_released_for_switch_2_v102/">early impressions</a> (<em>and as you might expect</em>), there are at least some tweaks and adjustments to improve the overall experience on Nintendo's platforms. Players have also apparently uncovered a few other details, claiming there are adjustments to "shadows" and "foliage", <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-has-shadow-dropped-both-on-switch-and-switch-2.15663/page-4#post-2128335">but other fan reports</a> suggest gyroscope controls and certain other control methods still aren't working with the game.</p>


<figure data-uuid="3dbe0ad375bc1"><a title="Famiboards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3dbe0ad375bc1/famiboards.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-has-shadow-dropped-both-on-switch-and-switch-2.15663/page-4#post-2128335">Famiboards</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, when we get the official patch notes from Aspyr, we'll provide an update about what exactly has changed, but for now you can at least update your game and hopefully experience an improved version.</p>
<p>When this title shadow dropped on the Switch 2 last year, we thought the overall experience on the Switch 2 was "great" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">awarding it 8 out of 10 stars</a>), even if it's not quite as 'Definitive' as the name suggests. Thankfully, the core gameplay experience is still a thrilling action romp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Crystal Dynamics’ 2013 reinvention of Lara Croft just might be the best entry in this decades-old franchise, and for the asking price, you’re getting a thrilling action romp that’ll keep you hooked until the credits."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nintendo released a new system firmware update for the Switch 2 yesterday and it's resolved some compatibility issues.</p>
<p>There's been an issue with the 2021 releases <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a></strong>, with both Switch titles reportedly crashing from time to time on the new hybrid system. Fortunately, Nintendo appears to have finally resolved these problems after the rollout of the 21.2.0 system firmware.</p>
<p>This is now officially reflected on Nintendo's <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">software compatibility search page</a>:</p><div><figure data-videoid="UhXw8bSC6A0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytUhXw8bSC6A0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38ea9bvrophi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 01/13/2026</strong> - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One other game fixed is the "RTS, tower defense, and match-3" title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cats_on_duty">Cats on Duty</a> (<em>yes, you read that correctly</em>), which is <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/01006b401d426000">now fully supported</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also identified an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe</a> on the Switch 2 tied to audio issues in certain areas of the game, so we'll hopefully see a fix for this soon. Once again, you can find out more about the compatibility of Switch titles on the Switch 2 via Nintendo's software compatibility search page.</p>
