<p>Sales launch in just under a week, with LRG offering up both a standard edition and a collector's edition, known officially as the 'Full Force Edition'.</p>
<p>The big boy comes with several added extras, including:</p>
<ul>

<p>Of course, all of these goodies do ramp up the price slightly, so you're looking at $79.99 for the Full Force Edition. The standard, meanwhile, is a bit more forgiving at $39.99. Limited Run Games has also clarified that this won't be a numbered release, so if you're looking for a full LRG set, missing out on this one won't be the end of the world.</p>
<p>Now let's check out a brief summary of the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"R-Type Delta HD Boosted features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this PlayStation masterpiece until they’re sharp enough to cut glass. You simply haven’t experienced R-Type Delta until you've played it in high definition. This version of the game also comes equipped with a new Practice Mode for those of you who want to polish your skills until they are as sharp as the resolution itself!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted will be available digitally on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="72fca9445ef7b"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72fca9445ef7b/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>We had a blast with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> when it arrived on Switch and Switch 2 earlier this summer, but we can all agree that it was missing something, right? Something like, we don't know, bingo?</p>
<p>Well, Marvelous has answered the call and has added exactly that in the new ver. 1.1.0 update. Yes, 'Happy Bingo' is the big addition this time around, giving you the daily chance to fill out an activity card and win a prize. You'll need to have reached 'City Bazaar Rank' or higher to unlock the new mode, but with that out of the way, it's bingo a-go-go.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436npowhk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's a little more information about the new mode from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2508780/view/499459531596630810">Steam game page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve updated the game and reached “City Bazaar Rank,” the Nature Sprites will visit during an event cut scene introducing “Happy Bingo.” Each spot on the card features an everyday activity like fishing or petting animals. Players complete these activities to fill spots on their card until they’ve completed a Happy Bingo! Players then turn in completed cards at the Nature Sprites’ stall, Happy Shoppe, on bazaar days to earn a variety of useful items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's not just bingo, either. Marvelous has thrown a handful of other fixes and tweaks into this update, all of which were shared in an update post on Steam. We've collected these patch notes together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Ver. 1.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bingo features added<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue resulting in a rare game crash<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where dismounting from horse would reset bag color to default outfit settings<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where pet food bowl would stop functioning properly after rehoming a pet<br></li>
<li>Adjusted select BGM and sound effect volume<br></li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
<li>Addressed Unity security vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>While we had a few small issues with the fishing and sheer number of gameplay systems, we called Grand Bazaar "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 8/10 review</a>. You'll find it in full below.</p>
