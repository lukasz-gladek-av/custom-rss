<p>Patch 1.2 offers up a healthy batch of fixes and improvements, including gameplay tweaks, visual updates, and quality-of-life additions such as a separate save slot for quick saves. It's all very welcome, and should go toward making an already-excellent game even better.</p>
<p>We gave System Shock 2 a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">9/10 in our recent review</a>, highlighting the amazing story and explorative elements, but noting that the combat could feel slightly dated at times.</p><div><figure data-videoid="gbGX-nnXc-E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d3c45rxnzwy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbGX-nnXc-E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 / Vita" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/210b61a9a6315/switch-2-vita.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite Sony's PS5 being on the market for nearly five years at this point, it still somehow feels <em>way</em> too soon to be talking about the inevitable PS6 – who even wants or needs one yet? Alas, here we are.</p>
<p>The latest rumour from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/rumour-ps6-handheld-device-can-be-docked-like-nintendo-switch-2">Push Square</a>) is particularly significant, because it seems to hint that Sony is planning to launch a variant of the PS6 that will not only be handheld, but can be docked – just like the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Codenamed 'Canis', the handheld is supposedly one of three SKUs planned for the PS6. The main one will be the 'Orion', which will be your bog-standard 'flagship' console with <em>all the specs</em>. The second is the 'Canis' handheld, and the third is the 'Canis' console, or the 'PS6 S'.</p>
<p>The latter two will share similar specs and will likely lean closer to what Sony is currently offering with the PS5/PS5 Pro, albeit with a few minor upgrades here and there.</p>
<p>So essentially, rather than focusing on sheer power – because if it ain't obvious by now, we're very much in the era of diminishing returns – Sony is seemingly looking to capture both the console and handheld market. Hopefully this might also mean that it's is able to offer slightly cheaper options, because if the so-called 'Orion' is going to retail at a similar price to the PS5 Pro ($749.99 / £699.99), Sony's going to have a real hard time shifting many of them.</p>
<p>Still, it's early days yet. It's best to take these rumours with a grain of salt for now until Sony officially reveals its plans.</p>
<p>Tell you what though, we know we said it's still way too early for a PS6, but a proper, native handheld PlayStation sounds awfully tempting...</p>

If you don't already own the existing Switch version, you can purchase the title for $39.99 / £30.49 (or your regional equivalent).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067okluts&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>For anyone who already has this title sitting in their game library, you can get the "Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack" for free. This upgrade comes with not only Joy-Con 2 mouse controller support, but also other enhancements like updated textures, higher frame rate and enhanced resolution.

<p>"The guild authorizes a special collaboration"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Recently, it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> content appearing in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and now Capcom is flipping this crossover around.</p>
<p>The developer will be bringing the hunt to its latest Street Fighter entry, dressing the fighters up with new EX colours, "new gears" and more. This limited-time event will be taking place between <strong>1st September 2025</strong> and <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about what exactly you can expect, and you can see it all in motion in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guild authorizes a special collaboration between Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest installments in both of these iconic franchises!</p>
<p>All players who log in during the event period will get special collab items! The Shop will also be stocked with special EX colors for Blanka, Akuma, Manon, Cammy, and Ken inspired by some wild creatures.</p>
<p>During this event, the Battle Hub will also get a new makeover while we run a special Street Voter event. Finally, the Monster Hunter 20th Anniversary Fighting Pass will return for the collab!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the game's online Battle Hub is also getting a themed makeover, and the 20th Anniversary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_rise_sunbreak">Monster Hunter</a> Fighter Pass will be making a return, so join in on the festivities while you can.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/street-fighter-6s-first-season-3-dlc-character-is-out-now-heres-a-look">recent release of the DLC fighter Sagat</a>, with multiple other characters also on the way as part of the Season 3 update. When we see and hear more about these additional fighters joining the roster, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although there's no word about Monster Hunter Wilds making its way to the Switch 2, Capcom did recently announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> for the platform. It will be arriving on Nintendo's new hardware at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has been celebrating Kirby in all sorts of ways recently, and apart from the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> on the Switch 2 this week, it's also been restocking its online shops with some goodies.</p>
<p>The item above, which first appeared in 2022, might not be the most exciting, but hey – we're sure some fans out there will appreciate "shopping bag" Kirby. You can get this "exclusive" My Nintendo Store product in the US and Canada for <strong>600 Platinum Points</strong> (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1961104654101627083">thanks for the heads up, Wario64</a>).</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about it, along with another look. One other thing to note is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15575?_gl=1*l9scot*_gcl_au*Mzc3MzcxMjUxLjE3NTY0Mjg1MDc.*_ga*MzM2MjI1NS4xNzU2NDI4NTA4*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NTY0Mjg1MDckbzEkZzEkdDE3NTY0MzAxNTAkajU4JGwwJGg5NDQ5MDE5MzI.">shipping fees apply</a>.</p>

<p>The third-party title got a full cartridge release</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b1cb4e9b9f45/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch 2 generation has got off to a solid start, but not everything has been rosy – with Game-Key Cards becoming a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">huge talking point within the community</a>. Many third-party developers are currently shipping their games on these cards, but have also come under fire for not offering <em>proper</em> physical releases.</p>
<p>Of course, outside of first-party Nintendo games, there are a handful of teams offering their titles on full game cards, so what's the pay-off? While we haven't really had any information about this up until now, CD Projekt Group's latest financial report has shared data about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s digital and physical sales in the Switch 2's launch month.</p>
<p>According to a graphic on the fourth page of this report, approximately <strong>75.4%</strong> of Switch 2 users who purchased this title in June bought the physical version, which contained the entire game on the cartridge. As you can see, <strong>24.6%</strong> opted to purchase the game digitally last month, with the game also hovering at the top of eShop purchases in its opening month.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd341d2a7cee8/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing this report didn't reveal was the exact sales figures, but according to some other sales updates in select regions recently, Cyberpunk 2077 has been featured in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">best-selling charts in its opening month</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This follows comments by CDPR's Vice President of Business Development Jan Rosner, who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/cyberpunk-2077-dev-tells-studios-do-not-underestimate-the-physical-edition">spoke earlier this year about offering a "complete" physical edition</a> of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 – stating at the time how "Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere".</p>
<p>He further noted how physical releases are "especially important for the Nintendo audience", acknowledging how "the right thing to do" was to have Cyberpunk 2077 "on the cartridge".</p>
