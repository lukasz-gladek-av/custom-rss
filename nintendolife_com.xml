<figure data-uuid="0f8fe0aa4ee94"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f8fe0aa4ee94/xenoblade-chronicles-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Monolith Soft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours about a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> release have started to circulate online today after a possible leak on the casting platform Spotlight.</p>
<p>The page of voice actor Caitlin Thorburn (who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qvb7f9/caitlin_thorburn_just_updated_her_spotlight_page/">voiced multiple roles in the second game</a>) has reportedly been updated to reference a "Xenoblade Chronicles" project due out in 2026. She's apparently reprising her role as KOS-MOS, who previously appeared in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/xenosaga_i_and_ii">Xenosaga</a> series.</p>

<p>So that's what's supposedly been leaked. As for the legitimacy of this, it is just a rumour for now, but <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/monolith-soft-development-and-speculation-st.51/page-55#post-2165560">apparently the profile</a> can only be updated and edited by the person who is the subject of the page.</p>
<p>If this is a sign of a new Xenoblade game (or a returning one), this wouldn't actually be the first time something like this has happened. Xenoblade fans have been quick to point out how something similar happened ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, when the Melia voice actor Jenna Coleman spoke about "another game" before the official announcement.</p>

<p>If we hear any updates, we'll let you know. Just be mindful Nintendo or Monolith Soft haven't announced any new or returning Xenoblade Chronicles projects at this stage.</p>

<p>Following a delay last September</p>

<figure data-uuid="56cfcaf6b549d"><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56cfcaf6b549d/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last September, 2K Games and Gearbox Software announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> had been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">delayed for Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The plan was to spend a little extra time to deliver the "best possible experience" on Nintendo's new system, but it appears the plan has changed. In Take-Two's latest earnings results (the parent company of 2K Games), the Switch 2 version has been removed from the company's release schedule.</p>
<p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Variety, the "difficult decision" has been made to "pause development" on this particular version of the game. The team at Gearbox is instead focused on delivering "quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game".</p>
<p>This decision <em>won't</em> impact other Switch 2 projects, and 2K will continue to collaborate closely with Nintendo. Upcoming releases for Switch 2 include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pga-tour-2k25">PGA TOUR 2K25</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26</a>.</p>
<p>Before the most recent delay and cancellation of pre-orders, Borderlands 4 was meant to arrive on the Switch 2 in October 2025. This title was originally released on other platforms last September and while the shift to open world was praised, there were also reports of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/borderlands-4?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">console version's problematic performance</a> at the time.</p>

<p>As we enter February, Nintendo has today announced two more title for the Switch Online's Game Boy library.</p>
<p>Today, it's the 1990/91 platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/balloon_kid">Balloon Kid</a> and along with this is the 1991/92 puzzle title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/yoshi">Yoshi</a>. Here's the official Nintendo description of both games and you can check out the trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yoshi™</strong></p>
<p>Yoshi is an action/puzzle game starring Mario's trusty buddy Yoshi, who has been imprisoned in an egg. Now it's raining Goombas, Bloopers, and Boo Buddies, and you have to help Mario stop the airborne invasion. As the critters fall, catch them on trays. Stack two of a kind and they both disappear, or capture the whole bunch in between eggshells. When the eggshells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. To save the day, switch and shuffle, and don't let your piles get too high!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Balloon Kid™</strong></p>
<p>In the little town of Pencilvania, there lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother Jim would spend countless days filling the skies with their balloons. One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away.</p>
<p>As Alice, you must save your brother from peril. Float through eight different stages as you follow Jim's trail of balloons. Collect as many balloons as possible to earn bonuses. Test your piloting skills to avoid enemies, or let go of your balloons to face enemies on the ground. In BALLOON TRIP mode, compete for the highest score and move up the ranks. Take a big gulp of courage and give Alice a hand as she searches for her missing brother!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan is getting Yoshi and <strong>Balloon Fight GB</strong> this week. The second game is the Game Boy Color version. Here's a look:</p>
