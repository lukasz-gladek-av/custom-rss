<p>Mario &amp; Luigi vs. Bowser Jr.</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At The Game Awards, Nintendo and Illumination surprised fans with another look at the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>It features Bowser Jr. taking on Mario and Luigi in a very brief teaser. Some not-so-pleasant introductions are exchanged, and before you know it, the younger Bowser is smashing everything in sight. Fortunately, Luigi steps in to save the day (and Mario).</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to arrive in theatres next year in <strong>April 2026</strong>. This latest teaser follows the announcement of the new movie in November, along with an official trailer reveal. You can see the first video in our previous story.</p>
<p>This wasn't the only video game movie trailer shared at The Game Awards this year. Capcom also showed off a first-look at its live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> movie.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The Game Awards for 2025 has officially wrapped, and <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> by French Studio Sandfall Interactive has been crowned the 'Game of the Year'.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, the competition included <strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></strong> and <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong>.</p>

<p>On the Nintendo front, Donkey Kong Bananza won best family game and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a></strong> was crowned the best sports/racing game of 2025.</p>


<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also picked up multiple other awards on the night, including best independent game, best performance, best art direction, best score and music, best debut indie, best narrative, best game direction and best RPG.</p>
