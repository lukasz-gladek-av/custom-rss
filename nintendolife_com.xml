<p>Evil Empire recently shared a blog post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/541130614987817395">Steam</a> page, revealing the Spring 2026 roadmap with all of the new additions we can expect in the coming months. Alongside the new 'Flaming Horses' tool (out now), the team announced the 'Breathless Update', which will arrive in April, and the 'Endgame Update, which'll launch in May.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8svhzrp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As you might expect from the name, the first of these is all about upping the speed. The Breathless update introduces some tweaks to the early section of the game, including when/how unlocks are introduced and boss battle difficulties. There will also be a new freeze element and slingshot weapon, gauntlet 'arena' zones, and new weapon affixes.</p>
<p>Here's the official Breathless Update summary from Evil Empire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>“Breathless update”</strong> will arrive with a public beta around the end of March! As you can guess from its title, this update means making the whole experience quicker and more intense, leaving you... breathless!</p>
<p>We have done a big rework of the pacing of the <strong>first hour,</strong> including when and how you will unlock new game content and new mechanics, as well as the bosses’ difficulty. Reworks of the level design of the first few biomes will also highlight our iconic wall-run move and make each biome <strong>quicker and tougher</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>veteran</strong> players who have been looking forward to new toys to play with, don't worry, we've got you covered! First up, we're introducing a new element - <strong>freeze</strong> – which is coming with a new weapon, the slingshot!</p>
<p>Next on the list is the <strong>arenas</strong> – zones that lock you in, and the only way out is to defeat wave after wave of enemies!</p>
<p>Most importantly, <strong>weapon affixes</strong> are coming too!! These affixes will make each weapon that appears in your run much more interesting and varied, giving you some difficult choices to take...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Details are a little thinner for May's Endgame update, but we do know that it'll mainly focus on late-game sections (shockingly), with some extra challenges thrown in there too. Here's how the dev puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're planning for it to land in early May, and some of the content may change, but we know what we'd like to do... It will focus on the End Game, plus bringing more challenges like Speed Run mode and Daily Awakening.</p>
<p>You'll be able to really test your skill and push the limit with this update coming! Speed, precision, and strategy—show us what you've got.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We had a great time with The Rogue Prince of Persia when it arrived on Switch 2 late last year, calling it "a very easy recommendation for anyone interested in a more approachable roguelite that doesn’t have a massive learning curve" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">our review</a>. Here's hoping that the free updates keep the good times going throughout 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse (Switch) - Plenty To Plunder In This Solid Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse</link>
            <guid>1437982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_seven_mysteries_of_honjo">Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo</a> was one of the most delightful surprises for the Switch; a visual novel that broke the fourth wall in unique ways while telling a compelling story laced with horror. The sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_mermaids_curse">Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse</a>, is more of the same, and that’s a good thing. If Square Enix wants to keep putting out new Paranormasight cases for the foreseeable future, that’s A-okay with me.</p>
<p>Unlike the first title, The Mermaid’s Curse spends a little more time setting up the story and providing more background behind the mysteries at play. As such, you might find the first couple of hours quite slow by comparison, though the result is a narrative that eventually feels more fleshed out and complete. That said, there’s no denying that you’ll need to persevere through the opening segments to get to the good stuff, and that’s something that simply wasn’t a thing with the original.</p>
<p>Progression is mostly a case of chatting with your companions while observing your surroundings and completing the odd minigame. One of the earlier scenes has you diving to the sea bed in an effort to recover valuable material, and the more you succeed, the more you can increase your ability to swim, extract items, breathe, etc. It’s shallow stuff (pun totally intended), but it’s a nice little detour from the lengthy dialogue sequences.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes, The Mermaid’s Curse is loaded with text that you’ll need to work your way through fairly slowly if you want to take it all in over the roughly 10-hour runtime. Specifically, the in-game files and character profiles contain hundreds of words' worth of backstory and lore. This isn’t a game to rush through.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be a <em>little</em> frustrating at times, since you’re essentially unable to progress onto the next scene until you’ve exhausted all possible lines of dialogue. This means pursuing the same topics multiple times until every character has had their say. The game does indicate which ones you’ve completed with a handy little tick next to each subject, but it can definitely feel quite drawn out.</p>
<p>If you’re also a fan of the oppressive, grim nature of the original game, The Mermaid’s Curse might also give you a bit of whiplash. Lots of scenes take place in broad daylight, with seemingly no sign of anything weird or supernatural. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of the story involves exploring past events, historical context, and interrogating various characters. You’re certainly not going to be using curses every five minutes to kill an NPC, and overall, it never feels particularly unsettling or scary.</p>
<p>It’s still well worth your time, though, even if it doesn’t match up to the original. As for performance, everything runs perfectly fine on the Switch, with some lovely DS-inspired static images throughout along with excellent, mysterious music. Similarly, I experienced no hitches on the Switch 2, so if that’s your platform of choice, you’ll be fine there.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse]]></content:encoded>
