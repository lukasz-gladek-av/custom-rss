<p>Crawl through dungeons and learn Japanese in Shujinkou</p>
</section><section>

<p>2025 has been an absolutely stacked year for video games — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> are just a few games that have picked up over a 90 average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/">OpenCritic</a>. But until Hades II arrived, there was a game that stood head and shoulders above the rest, and you might not have even heard of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> launched on PC via Steam and PS5 earlier this year and the Switch version is out <strong>today</strong> (2nd October) on the eShop for £26.99 / $29.99 (or your regional equivalent). The port was actually announced about a month ago, but given the craziness of September, it completely slipped by us!</p>
<p>Developed by Rice Games, a studio founded by Julian Rice, Shujinkou is a dungeon-crawling RPG where you can also learn how to speak and write Japanese. Anyone with decent knowledge of Japanese might spot that the very game's title translates to 'Protagonist' and that the three main characters are all named Shu, Jin, and Kou.</p>
<p>But teaching you Japanese isn't the primary focus — while it is a part of the game, it's actually entirely optional, and Julian Rice has said in interviews that "It is not a Japanese language learning tool". This is first and foremost a video game inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/etrian_odyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the RPG side of things, then this rundown from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shujinkou-switch/">eShop</a> should help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Japanese is entirely optional. For those more interested in the adventure, Shujinkou delivers a rich role-playing experience:</p>
<p>• Explore challenging labyrinths and solve puzzles from a first-person perspective.<br>
• Engage in strategic turn-based battles that evolve over time.<br>
• Switch to “English-Only” mode at any time to focus solely on the gameplay experience.<br>
• Master hundreds of Arawasu skills and uncover powerful items.<br>
• Forge dozens of distinct weapons and armor, each with unique flavor text.<br>
• Fish for a wide variety of marine creatures at various scenic spots.<br>
• Complete 100 side quests that explore and expand upon the many inhabitants of Genya.<br>
• Play six minigames hosted by members of the Fuu Lobby.<br>
• Revisit your journey through the Art Gallery and Jukebox.</p>
<p>Having been in development for over six years, what truly sets Shujinkou apart is its additional, seamless integration of Japanese language learning. Whether you’re only here for the adventure or here to finally learn Japanese through a real video game, the ability to learn a challenging, real-world skill makes Shujinkou stand out in the already-crowded genre of amazing role-playing games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game is currently at a 94 on OpenCritic after 9 reviews, and a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/shujinkou/">90 on Metacritic</a> after 6 reviews. That's not many, <em>but</em> it is notable, as many of those reviews are pretty glowing.</p>
<p>"Shujinkou is a phenomenal game, easily making its way to the ranks of my favorite JRPGs,' says <a href="https://noisypixel.net/shujinkou-review-jrpg-learn-japanese/">Noisy Pixel</a> in its review. <a href="https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/02/review-shujinkou-sony-playstation-5.html?callback=in&amp;code=MMVJY2YXNGETODHLZC0ZMGI4LWE4MTGTMJI1ODJHNWEZNJNK&amp;state=b14c57950a9c4fd0a2d7245c8890cb76">Digitally Downloaded</a> was equally full of praise, saying "It’s an inspired, intelligent idea and I hope people give it a chance despite being as indie as they come." And, similarly, <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/shujinkou/">RPGFan</a> calls the game "one of the most ambitious indie games I’ve ever played."</p>
<p>Obviously that's just a handful of opinions (there are a few lower-scores there) and over on Steam, it's only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386630/Shujinkou/">garnered 14 reviews</a>. But the fusion of mechanics alone has us interested. Shujinkou, we have our eyes on you.</p>

<p>And it's coming to Switch this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Onion Games has shared the Western release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stray_children">Stray Children</a>, a childlike RPG where a young boy is transported into the world of a retro RPG and encounters a world where only children live. And it's finally coming out in the West on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar, well, it should! Onion Games is the team behind the rerelease of the cult classic PS1 RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/moon">Moon</a>, which similarly transported your character inside the world of a video game.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the devs at Onion Games worked on the original 1997 release; the team is primarily made up of Yoshiro Kimura (director and game designer), Kurashima Kazuyuki (art director), and Hirofumi Taniguchi (composer), whose credits include <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/rule_of_rose">Rule of Rose</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/chulip">Chulip</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/little_kings_story">Little King's Story</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a>. That's an eclectic mix!</p>
<p>But Stray Children seems to be very much in the same vein as Moon, an oddball RPG which subverts genre tropes. Moon is probably most famous for inspiring Toby Fox and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> nowadays, and you can see those elements even clearer here.</p>
<p>Instead of battling enemies outright, you can choose to whisper in the ear of the Olders — described as "monstrous adults carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and the many other grievances that all grown-ups gather." Oh geez, way to call us out, Onion Games...</p>

<p>You can choose to make them laugh, smile, or tell them you love them, but don't expect to win them over immediately. There will be plenty of strange and unique interactions throughout as you attempt to save the kids from the Olders. And if Moon is anything to go by, this will certainly be a bit of an odd one.</p>
<p>October is already packed full of amazing games, but this one could be one to look out for. Especially if you loved Moon (like this writer did). It's not for everyone, but there's nothing else quite like it.</p>
