<p>Fully compatible with Switch and Switch 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Accessory manufacturers GameSir and Hyperkin have joined forces to produce a fully modular controller that's compatible with the Switch and Switch 2: the <strong>GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron</strong>.</p>
<p>Ignoring the terrible name for a moment, this thing actually looks pretty neat. Utilising an extendable telescopic arm design, you can clip it onto your Switch, Switch 2, iPhone, iPad, or Android devices for instant handheld play. It also comes with Bluetooth technology to allow for PC gaming, if you wish.</p>
<p>The biggest draw, however, is the modular design. You can swap out the front modules to completely customise your controller's layout, with options ranging from a fight pad design to faithful (ish) recreations of the GameCube and N64 controllers.</p>
<p>It also comes with a host of modern features that you'd come to expect from controllers these days, including triggers that can swap between tactile, micro-switch functionality to full Hall Effect analogue functionality. Similarly, the capacitive sticks come with the ability to alter their height to ensure maximum comfort for each individual player.</p>
<p>It all sounds lovely on paper, but we do wonder if this 'Jack of all Trades' approach will work out for Gamesir and Hyperkin. CES 2026 attendees can get an in-person view of an early model of the X5 Alteron, but we'll have to wait and see if this thing can be a legitimate contender in a world jam-packed with third-party controllers.</p>

<p>There's no word on when the X5 Alteron will launch, but we'll keep you posted as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>How will it hold up on Switch 2?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> arrives on the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms next month, and ahead of the anticipated release, new footage has surfaced at CES 2026 this week.</p>
<p>During Nvidia's PC showcase of the title featuring path tracing and DLSS 4 with multi frame generation, a new setting in the series has reportedly been revealed. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/resident-evil-requiems-nvidia-trailer-includes-a-big-tease-at-a-new-environment/">highlighted by VGC</a>, it's a glimpse at a "new city environment" and what's believed to be the fictional location Wrenwood, where the game unfolds.</p>
<p>What's so unique here is it's a big contrast to what we're used to seeing in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> series. Instead of chaos and zombies in every direction, as you can see, it's actually a lively place, with humans and vehicles making their way through the streets. Of course, we don't know for sure how much activity will take place here, but it's an exciting glimpse!</p>
<figure data-uuid="71948ed41df8d"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71948ed41df8d/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom, Nvidia</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the source further notes, <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Resident Evil enthusiast Dusk Golem</a> (who has a history covering Capcom-related rumours) has previously mentioned how Requiem could contain some "big open levels". It follows the news last month that the legend and video game icon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem">Leon Kennedy would be returning</a> in the latest outing. You can check out Nvidia's full clip above, which shows the new protagonist and FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft walking around the city.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance and visuals on the Switch 2, Nintendo Life contributor Lowell Bell went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">hands on with the handheld build at the Tokyo Game Show</a> in 2025 - mentioning at the time how this version still "looked amazing" (even though there was a "visual downgrade") and didn't notice any "dropped frames". So, hopefully, the final build for Switch 2 launches in a good state when this title arrives on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> demo is now live in select locations around the globe, and we've got some early details about how this game runs. This comes from the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGIHRqRQWp0">YouTube channel SwitchUp</a>, which regularly investigates the performance of Switch and Switch 2 games.</p>
<p>Players on Nintendo's original hybrid system can seemingly expect 30fps (with some frame pacing stutters), and as you might have already guessed, there's a drop in resolution. On the Switch 2, the game will run at a "silky smooth" 60fps, with more consistent frame pacing. Both versions apparently deliver a respectable experience in handheld mode - with the Switch 2 build maintaining smoothness in portable play. The Switch OLED panel also makes the game look great, and Switch load times are "surprisingly solid".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067irhojm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The TLDR is that on Switch 1, if you're playing on an OLED, it looks better, although it does run at 30 frames per second with a few visual downgrades. There are also some stutters below 30 frames in certain scenes and you'll notice that in the frame pacing...on the Switch 2, everything is silky smooth, 60fps - perhaps the very occasional stutter...it looks great"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's further mentioned how this reimagined version has gone "all in" with the shallow depth of field technique, as it gives everything a <em>proper</em> diorama look similar to Square Enix's previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">HD-2D</a> games. There's also some "noticeable aliasing" across both versions of the game, but overall, it's a better experience in the "higher resolution" Switch 2 version, even with some jaggy edges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...Generally, it looks absolutely stunning. The ocean waves, the way they've designed those to overlap each other to kind of almost be an illusion of three dimensions works great. There are a couple of issues in terms of texture overlap. If you look carefully you might see the straight lines in certain scenes, perhaps a little work needed there but nothing major."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also differences in the level of detail and draw distance across the Switch and Switch 2 versions, but the overall image quality and amount of effects (minus some particle effects and other effects) remain intact on the original platform. Keep in mind the full game isn't out until <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, so the demo may not necessarily reflect the final release. When more information about the game's performance and resolution is revealed, we'll provide an update.</p>
