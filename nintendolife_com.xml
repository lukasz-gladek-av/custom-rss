<p>Dotemu has finally revealed that the hotly anticipated beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> will assemble on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>1st December 2025</strong>. What's more, it's lifted the lid on two new characters in the roster.</p>
<p>Aside from giving us the release date, the all-new trailer also gives us our first look at Iron Man and Phoenix, the final two fighters in the game's 15-hero line-up. <strong>Spectacular Spider-Man</strong>'s Josh Keaton will be lending his vocal talents to Tony Stark, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>'s Jennifer Hale will voice Jean Grey — the same character she voiced in <strong>X-Men '97</strong>.</p>
<p>Yep, these were the two names unearthed in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-datamine-leaks-more-heroes">earlier datamine</a> of the game's Steam demo, but hey, it's still exciting to see them in action. Here's a closer look at the new pair:</p>

<p>With these two newbies, the full launch character roster is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Phyla-Vell</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Nova</li>
<li>She-Hulk</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Silver Surfer</li>
<li>Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Phoenix</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a strong collection, and every new trailer sells us even more on the beat 'em up gameplay — if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> is anything to go by, we're in for a treat.</p>

<p>But producer Kensuke Tanabe decided against it</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="359443003808c"><a title="Metroid Prime Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359443003808c/metroid-prime-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is shortly launched <strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>, a new art book looking at concept art for the original trilogy on GameCube and Wii (with a small section dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of the more recent Switch remaster, the book reveals that Retro Studios had originally proposed completely new cutscenes for the game. However, in a producer's note, Kensuke Tanabe confirmed that he opted against this approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the project first started, Retro proposed an idea regarding cutscenes – that we create entirely new ones. The prototype cutscene they presented was undeniably impressive, with a high level of quality.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>"However, I came to the decision to closely observe the cutscenes from the GameCube version and replicate them essentially as they were. The reason for this choice was that the cutscenes were not created solely for dramatic effect; they also played a role in conveying gameplay-relevant information to the player. Each scene was carefully crafted with this purpose in mind. Retro demonstrated exceptional professionalism and fully adhered to this direction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting, huh? It's hard to imagine what this cutscene prototype might have looked like, but our assumption is that it might have been something akin to Halo 2: Anniversary. That game, remastered by Halo Studios (then 343 Industries) took the original Bungie-created cutscenes and revamped them from the ground up.</p>
<p>Still, we fully understand Tanabe's reasoning here. The cutscenes do provide a lot of information to the player regarding gameplay mechanics, so we can't be too mad. The final product looks pretty amazing as it is, after all!</p>

<p>What are you saying, Tanabe?!</p>

<p>Fans have been speculating about the prospect of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> remaster/remake for quite some time now, and interestingly, the book actually somehow teases and debunks such a concept in one go.</p>
<p>The following quote from Tanabe regarding Echoes' multiplayer mode seemingly confirms that a remake isn't in development, and nor is it currently being planned. But at the same time, it kind of reads like a bit of a tease, right?</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Retro completed the multiplayer mode without compromising on quality even under such challenging conditions. Being of its time, it was designed for local play, so the number of players who actually experienced it might not have been very large. If it is remade, I would be delighted for more people to have the chance to experience it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gosh, who knows... Either way, it's seems likely at this point that we won't be seeing anything of the sort until well after the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which drops on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd sure love to see it, though. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a> while you're at it please, Nintendo!</p>
