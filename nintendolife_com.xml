<figure data-uuid="36287598ec7cb"><a title="legend of Zelda weapons toy set" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36287598ec7cb/legend-of-zelda-weapons-toy-set.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Candy Toy</em></figcaption></figure><p>The fantastic character designs of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda</a> series have always lent themselves very well to amiibo, toys, and all of that sweet merchandising action that we all seem to love very muchly. Big muchly!</p>
<p>Now, Bandai Candy Toy has announced a set of ten collectible, fully-licensed Legend of Zelda weapons, which we love the idea of because, hey, the weapons in these games deserve a whole lot of love too.</p>
<p>Currently slated for release on February 31st 2026 in Japan (cheers to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tokyogamelife.bsky.social">@TokyoGameLife</a> for the heads-up), the dinky box set recreates Link's Hylian Shield, Master Sword, bow, and a bunch of other iconic weapons from the most recent games in the series, in cute, palm-sized, miniature fashion. Heck, each one even comes with its own little stand and everything.</p>

<p>We've had a little browse around this morning, and the collection is out of stock on most hobby shops that ship worldwide already, so you may need to have a proper search if you are interested, and the price has been varying thanks to pre-order offers, between around $30 - $40 (before taxes and delivery costs) or whatever that translates to where you are.</p>
<p>Here's some more details and pics from Bandai (via <a href="https://hobby-genki.com/en/candy-toy-bandai-shokugan-bandai/63956-the-legend-of-zelda-weapon-collection-10pack-box.html">Hobby-Genki</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>・1 Pre-painted Miniature Figure (9 possible types)<br>
・1 Dedicated Display Base (engraved with title logo)<br>
・(Master Sword only) Additional support stand for pairing with Master Sword (Sheathed Ver.)<br>
・(Sheathed Master Sword only) Additional display base<br>
・1 Soda-flavored gum</p>
<p>Lineup (9 Types)<br>
1. Master Sword<br>
2. Hylian Shield<br>
3. Royal Claymore<br>
4. Zora Longsword<br>
5. Seven Jewels Dagger<br>
6. Great Eagle Bow<br>
7. Stonecrusher<br>
8. Lightscale Trident<br>
9. Rare: Master Sword (Sheathed Ver)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>Now, to think of a target small enough to neutralise with a pocket Great Eagle Bow.</p>

<p>Before this one can blast onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong>, Nintendo has served up the game's pre-order goodies on <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fkirby-air-riders" rel="sponsored noopener">My Nintendo Store UK</a>. As standard, the listings include a small bonus for <em>all</em> pre-orders and the option to upgrade to a 'bundle' for more merch.</p>
<p>We'll start with the standard option. All My Nintendo Store Air Riders pre-orders (<strong>£58.99</strong> for digital, <strong>£66.99</strong> for physical) will come the <em>exclusive</em> Kirby Air Riders Reusable Cup. That's right, <em>it's a cup</em>. It's adorned with pictures of Kirby, Dedede, Chef Kawasaki et al, and it can hold a whopping 350ml of your hot beverage of choice.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Is it the most mind-blowing addition out there? Absolutely not, but we suppose it's roughly on par with the usual keychains and microfibre cloths included in these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bundles are a good bit cuter. Upping the price to <strong>£70.99</strong> for a digital copy and <strong>£78.99</strong> for physical, these also throw in a Kirby plushie to sweeten the deal. There are three different plushies to choose between — Warp Star Kirby, Sleepy Kirby and Ultra Sword Kirby — and all are available for the same bundle price on the MNS website.</p>

<p>Both the bonus cup and plushie bundles can now be pre-ordered from the My Nintendo Store UK website, though the extras will only be sticking around "while stocks last", so make sure to get in there quickly if you have a particular purchase in mind.</p>

<p>It only works in two-player mode</p>

<figure data-uuid="bd12a019bd879"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd12a019bd879/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is out this week, and in case you missed it, it comes with all sorts of enhancements. Apart from the resolution boost on the Switch 2, the game also supports the system's Joy-Con 2 mouse mode feature, which is a welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Before you jump in and try this out, there's one thing you might want to know. This mode can only be accessed in the 'Co-Star Mode' with a second player. Here's the full rundown about this from our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Co-Star Mode’ makes a welcome return for those who wish to bring a friend on board to help gather Star Bits or defeat enemies. Player Two waggles their Joy-Con about to move the onscreen cursor, but if you’re on Switch 2, you can also use the console’s mouse functionality, and it works wonderfully. Chances are you’ll play both games solo, but it’s a nice little extra regardless."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890gryjum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>So, if you were hoping to experience mouse mode on a single-player run, it seems you're out of luck. You'll need to call on a friend, family member, or someone else if you want to properly test it out. Once again, this control mode in these new versions is only accessible to Switch 2 users.</p>
<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be made available on 2nd October, with fans also able to purchase each game separately from the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> this week, Nintendo has released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> on the Switch.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo's official support page, Version 1.2.2 addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience. It doesn't go into any details beyond this, but if we find out what is going on behind the scenes here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Compatibility with existing versions is also noted, so be mindful of that. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Ver. 1.2.2 (Released September 30, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Note: Does have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.2.1-1.1.0. Does not have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.0.0. Please be careful of the update version on each player’s system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major update for this same title in June</a>, which optimised the game's visuals and frame rate for the Switch 2. It also added HDR support in Bowser's Fury and a GameShare option.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the original release on Switch in our review here on Nintendo Life. Bowser's Fury is also well worth a look, if you haven't already given it a go.</p>

<p>Expect improved FPS, load times and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d04ea720d106d"><a title="Warframe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d04ea720d106d/warframe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Extremes (via Steam)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, the team at Digital Extremes provided a development update on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a> - confirming a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the free-to-play title was officially in the works.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent developer livestream, the team has shared the first gameplay footage from this particular build of the game, now that they've finally got their hands on some dev kits. It highlights faster load times, higher shading quality, improved frame rate, and more.</p>

<p>You can see a little <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2575538613">more gameplay footage</a> in the official stream around the 28-minute mark. Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair reiterates how the load times are much shorter than the Switch counterpart, and also notes how this new version of the title will apparently target 60fps in docked mode.</p>
<p>There's no information just yet about when exactly the Switch 2 version of Warframe will be released, but when we hear more, we'll be sure to let you know. Warframe was made available for the original Switch in 2018. The port specialists at Panic Button helped out with this version of the game at the time, and we labelled it a "remarkable technical feat" for Nintendo's hybrid system.</p>
