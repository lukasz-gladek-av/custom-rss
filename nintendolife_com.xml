</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a fan of the Goemon and Mystical Ninja series, there was a rather exciting 40th anniversary announcement shared during this week's Japanese Partner Direct.</p>
<p>Konami and the <a href="https://x.com/M2_game/status/2019429197727572111">emulation experts at M2</a> are teaming up to release <strong>Ganbare Goemon Daishuugo!</strong> - a new retro collection coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms in Japan on <strong>2nd July 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This package will include 13 titles from across the series. It includes releases from the Famicom, Super Famicom and Game Boy era. Here's the full list (<a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2026/02/japanese-fans-are-getting-a-ganbare-goemon-collection-and-weve-never-been-more-jealous">thanks, <strong>Time Extension</strong></a>):</p>

<p>Once again, the catch is that this collection has only been announced for Japan. If there are any updates regarding a local release or online pre-orders, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>In some related news, during the local Partner Direct, Konami announced a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a> and it's available now on the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is now available. If you are wondering how the Switch 2 version holds up, the <a href="https://youtu.be/V5Ai1Zg4jGU?t=21">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has released a side-by-side graphics and performance comparison, showing it alongside the original Switch release.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition runs at 4K at 60fps docked, and there's also a 120fps option - lowering the game's resolution to 1080p. As for the handheld mode, players can expect a bump from 720p on Switch to 1080p on the Switch 2, with the game running at 120fps. You can see it all in motion in the video above.</p>
<p>The game's frame rate on the Switch 2 is mostly consistent when it comes to reaching its target frames, even on the higher 120fps setting. As we've already noted, this is a free upgrade if you already own the Switch version of the title. You can access this download from the eShop.</p>
<p>And if you don't own Hollow Knight on either of these platforms, it will set you back $15.00 / £10.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Chrono Trigger, Xenogears Writer Is Releasing A Brand New RPG On Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/chrono-trigger-xenogears-writer-is-releasing-a-brand-new-rpg-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1427554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment during today's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>, you may have caught a glimpse at a cute-looking RPG called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/another-eden-begins">Another Eden Begins</a>. Coming to Switch 2 and Switch 1 this <strong>summer</strong>, it features time travel, turn-based combat, ten different endings, and New Game+.</p>
<p>What if we also told you that the creator was none other than Masato Kato, one of the writers of acclaimed '90s Squaresoft RPGs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/xenogears">Xenogears</a>, as well as the director of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross</a>? And that the game's music is composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who <em>also</em> worked on all three of those games? The pieces are starting to fall into place now.</p>
<p>Yep, while it may have been a footnote during the Direct, this sounds like a big one for classic RPG fans. Plus, while it's not immediately clear from the trailer, this is almost-definitely a reworking of Kato's free-to-play mobile RPG <strong><a href="https://en.another-eden.jp/">Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space</a></strong>, which came out in 2017 and is still ongoing.</p>

<p>Fans online seem to think so, highlighting that Begins appears to only cover the first "arc" of the mobile game, while highlighting some of the differences, including a few character redesigns.</p>
<p>Taking place across multiple timelines, Aldo's younger sister is kidnapped by the Beast King. Forced to pursue them, the young hero finds himself falling through spacetime, where he awakens 800 years in the future.</p>
<p>As Aldo, you'll gather 18 different companions, including an android, a feisty hunter, and a noble frog samurai. Look, <em>you're</em> thinking it, not us (Okay, maybe us too) to help traverse the timelines and save the world. Blend in some strategic turn-based combat and you have a JRPG that feels ripped right out of the SNES and PSOne era.</p>

<p>So, this seems to be following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> formula of reworking a mobile favourite to remove the gacha elements <em>and</em> make it fit on home consoles. We'll have to wait for more details, but for now, this looks promising.</p>
