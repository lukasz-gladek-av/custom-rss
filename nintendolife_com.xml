<p>Keep in mind this is just one region and depending on your location, your Switch 2 eShop's top-selling games might look a bit different. Still, this provides an idea of what people are buying in the launch week of Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>In the UK, the lists are mostly the same - with Mario Kart in first, Cyberpunk in second, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> is in third place overall, No Man's Sky has also entered the top ten, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a> is listed as one of the most downloaded eShop titles in this location as well.</p>

<p>Or are you an agent of chaos?</p>

<figure><a title="MARIO KART POLL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3effd655ac2fb/mario-kart-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have been wanting to ask a bunch of people this question for a while now, and it seems this is as good a time as any!</p>
<p>It's a question of gaming habits really, and how you approach doing things within them, that I'm sure holds up a mirror (mode) to our personalities in the 'real world' and all that, but I'm not a certified mind...person...so let's skip getting into anything deep.</p>
<p>No, best not. Anyway. I'm the sort of gamer who needs to stay organised, I'm also the kind of person who checks that doors are locked 50 times every night before bed. It therefore stands to reason that, when playing the likes of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> game, let's say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, since that's popular at the moment for some reason, I 100% <em>must</em> complete a cup to its fullest and shiniest gold-star level before racing the next one.</p>
<p>It is — or at least it feels as though it is — against any religion to skip forward though cups without first making sure I fully rinse the one I'm currently on. I just don't do it. Well, unless something is really frustrating me, then I <em>might</em>. Only might, mind.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs with most games I play. I can't leave a nook or cranny unexplored in open-world games (something that often puts me off them entirely) and I always feel the need to spend extra time milling about and trying to find everything before moving on - hence why Ubisoft-esque maps full of icons have the effect of making me need a 'wee lie down'.</p>
<p>So, I want to know, via the medium of a good old-fashioned poll, how many of you lot need to make sure you've done <em>everything</em> before moving on in Mario Kart's cups, and who is reckless? Who lives their lives like gaming anarchists, blasting through everything without a care in the world? You know. Having <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Let's get polling!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera-shocking-image-quality-but-its-cuteness-will-snare-you<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd9984a9e6f89/review-nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Nintendo itself put out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">an official Switch 2 Camera</a> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the new console</a>, it's Hori's officially licensed — and we have to say <em>adorable</em> — Piranha Plant camera which attracted the most attention.</p>
<p>A little USB-C webcam fashioned after the enemies from the Super Mario series, it's certainly a lot more fun-looking that Nintendo's old-school radio mic-looking one. However, the cuteness comes with caveats when it comes to image quality.</p>
<p>Let's fetch our gardening gloves and take a look, shall we?</p>
<h2>What's in the box?</h2>

<p>In the box you get the camera itself (with clip-on leaves to attach to the stem), the base 'pot' which the camera connects to via USB-C, a 1.5m USB-C cable, and a little right-angled headphone jack adaptor (to use, presumably, if you're plugging in wired headphones but the leaves are in the way).</p>
<p>You also get a large leaflet full of warnings in various languages with a QR code pointing to <a href="https://hori.co.uk/content/PRODUCT%20MANUALS/NSX-001E_EN_Online_Manual.pdf">an instruction manual</a> containing the same warnings alongside the necessary how-to-use info.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, the resolution is 640 × 480 pixels, so instantly you shouldn't be expecting iPhone-level quality here. Capture is 30 frames-per-second and it has a viewing angle of 85°. To compare, Nintendo's offering offers 1080p with a viewing angle of around 110°.</p>

<p>As with Nintendo's standard camera, the Piranha Plant is surprisingly petite — even smaller than Nintendo's. The plant detaches from the pot, too, immediately making it an attractive option if you play in handheld mode a lot and plan on engaging in regular GameChat sessions with friends and family.</p>
<h2>First impressions</h2>
<p>I've never been a <em>massive</em> fan of Piranha Plants, with the notable exception of the amiibo, which ranks in my top three, probably. There's something about the detailing on the head, with the glistening tongue and the teeth, that I just find ace. And this camera has a similar effect! It's incredibly cute.</p>
<p>There's a specific place at the bottom of the stem for the leaves to clip on (I had them in the wrong place for a while). The plant's big lips close around the camera itself, which covers the lens for privacy - a neat touch compared to Nintendo's twisty shutter and 'on' light. The bendy stem/cable even lets you pose the plant, adding to the personality, and while it's not useful for anything in particular (other than taking pics of your camera - oh the irony), you're able to open its mouth halfway, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>The camera itself plugs into the top of the Switch simple enough. It's just light enough (30g) for the port to grip it solidly enough, though I wouldn't go shaking it too hard. But that goes for your shiny new Switch 2, as well.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c65e89c6c8f24/review-nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot capture is disabled when the camera's on, so getting shots is a challenge. On the plus side, the 480p resolution makes my scraggly beard look fuller - whack that in the 'Pros'... — <em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>I tested handheld mode first. Once the camera is plugged into the top and you're in a GameChat group, simply share your camera in the settings and you're off (or you can 'Test USB-C Camera' in the system settings beforehand).</p>
<p>You can manually zoom in and choose whether you want your background visible, although anybody who's fiddled around during a Zoom call or Google Meet knows the patchiness caused by suboptimal lighting and other environmental factors on these filters. You can also choose to have just your face framed in a circle.</p>
<p>As the modest specs should make obvious, it's immediately apparent that the video quality here will be surpassed by practically any other camera-quipped device in your house. This device is <em>extremely</em> limited in terms of video capture ability.</p>
<p>However, for what it's designed to do — ie. work in conjunction with GameChat to inject your hilarious face into Nintendo games so that your pals can see (as well as hear) your moans, groans, and celebratory yelps while dealing and receiving green-shell punishment — it functions just fine.</p>

<p>As well as being a camera stand, the green plant pot doubles as a clip to attach to your TV — handy if you park your dock behind the telly. Clipping it to my thin-screened LG OLED, it felt a little precarious, but provided you bend the plant stem to balance everything, it stays put well enough. Don't go shaking your TV...but again, why would you <em>want</em> to violently shake your expensive electronics? Why do you keep doing that? <em>Just leave them be!</em></p>
<p>Ahem. As with everything else with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the Switch 2 hardware</a>, the camera just works. The face-tracking follows you around the room well enough, although it definitely gets a little, erm, let's say 'impressionist' if you're feeling generous ('AI-style, feature-melting nightmare fuel' if not) when you move backwards out of its face-sensing range. Around three metres back it started getting choppy for me, and the camera failed to pick my face up after I moved three-and-a-half/four metres away in a decently-lit living room during the morning. It's not a high-tech gadget.</p>
<p>BUT! I'd argue that getting upset about the image quality here is missing the point somewhat. When you look at Nintendo's own offering, it's a sturdy little thing but it's only delivering 1080p and, crucially, if you're sitting across the room, the resolution of your face once it's been cropped out by the software will be an order of magnitude below HD.</p>
<p>Also, any video conferencing tool that automatically removes the background is patchy. With the official Nintendo one, there's all sorts of artefacting and flickering going on as the console struggles to filter out the non-human elements in suboptimal living room lighting conditions. The lower resolution of Hori's cam doesn't help, but it's not a massive step down from the alternative, either.</p>

<p>Simply put, whether you go with Nintendo or Hori, you aren't getting premium-level, full-resolution, Face Time-quality video with either option. However, it works well enough to get the job done (which at launch is essentially injecting a live profile pic into a box in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">we all had a great time GameChatting with that</a>).</p>
<p>Naturally, the more pixels, the better, but the Piranha Plant camera will be sufficient for the vast majority of face-tracking use cases. It looks like the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree TV</a> might demand more with its CameraPlay, and the resulting images will look commensurately worse with this 480p cam. But even with its lowest-of-low-tech qualities, this camera just makes me smile every time I see it. It's a fun little thing.</p>
<p>Compared to Nintendo's camera, it's a straight-up trade: resolution for cuteness. If you happen to have a compatible USB-C camera already, it's hard to recommend either, especially if you don't plan on making GameChat a regular thing. But given that this is cheaper than Nintendo's camera (outside the US at least - this is £33.99 / €39,99 / $59.99), and that the other one, while offering better resolution, is hardly a precision eyepiece, it's all much of a muchness to me.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're wondering, it absolutely works just as a standard PC webcam. So if your laptop camera's borked and you want to give your video calls that blurry, late-'90s vibe, a Piranha Plant on your desk is an option.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're buying Piranha Plant Camera — or any of the Switch 2 cameras — expecting a crystal-clear, super-sharp image, you're going to be disappointed. These are rough-and-ready webcams meant to deliver knockabout, lo-fi fun in the vein of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/game_boy_camera">Game Boy Camera</a> or the 3DS' in-built lens. Approached from that angle, Hori delivers the functionality you want in an exceptionally cute package.</p>
<p>If you're planning on streaming or you absolutely need the best possible picture quality, this simply won't meet your needs. Otherwise, only grade-A grouches won't grin when they walk into the living room and see this clipped to the top of the telly.</p>

<p>Expectedly, it's been another big one at Nintendo Life this week. We got the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">official sale numbers</a> on the console from Nintendo, ran down a bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/11-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">games with 'secret' Switch 2 performance updates</a> you should check out, <em>and</em>, as if we weren't all full of news already, Nintendo lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">new Splatoon spin-off</a> coming to Switch 2.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm using my crisp new system to dive into games at the cutting-edge of modern design... like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. Yes, I'm Switch 2-ing the GameCube catalogue in my downtime, but can you blame me? All those Knockout Tours take their toll on a man.</p>
<p>I'm also still fighting the urge to buy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>. I don't <em>need</em> anything else to play right now, but gosh, it sure does look good! Keep your wallet safe out there, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m very much invested in Cyberpunk 2077 at the moment; it’s a delight playing this game on the go, and I just love cruising around Night City. I never would have imagined such a graphically intensive experience with a huge open world would work so well in handheld mode, but there you go.</p>
<p>I’m also playing quite a bit of The Wind Waker and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. With the new wireless GameCube controller at hand, playing these games is like taking a time machine back to my early teenage years. Just pure bliss.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>OK, so, I haven't actually had much time to play Mario Kart World as much as I'd like to thus far, having only just managed to blast through all the cups in 100cc. So, this weekend we've got a big karting event scheduled, as I get busy smashing all of the content in free roam whilst my sons occasionally drop in to try (and fail) to best me in a race. Pair of losers.</p>
<p>Aside from this, I'm hopefully also gonna be getting into some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. I haven't played this one yet, and am hearing good things about the Switch 2 port (I don't mind 30fps in this sort of caper) so my wife and I are hopefully gonna be sitting down to some good old couch co-op. Have a nice weekend!</p>

<p>The Switch 2 has more in common with the Wii U release than Switch itself. In the first couple of months on Switch I only had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a> to mess with, while on the Wii U there were plenty of third party releases that ended up being my introduction to franchises like <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> and <strong>Mass Effect</strong>. So here I am with a Switch 2, a Nintendo first-party killer app named Mario Kart World, while I am also playing catch-up with Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>.</p>
<p>But this week I also took a glimpse into the near future thanks to the ongoing STEAM Next Fest, confirming that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will most certainly end up on my GOTY 2025 list, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> is the current-gen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> game of your dreams, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323490/Truxton_Extreme/">Truxton Extreme</a> lives up to its surname, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a> will certainly see a spot on my schedule next weekend.</p>
<p>This is certainly shaping up to be one hot Summer of gaming!</p>

<p>So, you've probably noticed I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart World. That's still the case — so many collectibles — but I have started a second Switch 2 game finally; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. Chapter 3 has had me howling with laughter (It's. T.V. TIME.) and I didn't realise how much I've missed Kris, Susie, and Ralsei.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm actually reviewing another game, a Switch 1 one, but you'll hear about that soon enough. Enjoy the weekend, folks!</p>

<p>In the run up to Switch 2 I was most excited about Mario Kart World, but actually it’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> that has held my attention so far, it’s simply a far better experience than on Switch. Therefore this weekend I’ll be freeing at least one Divine Beast as my little boy watches on, this his second Hyrule adventure after we played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> earlier this year. Mario Kart World will just have to wait!</p>
