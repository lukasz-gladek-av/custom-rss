<figure><a title="Dum Dum - Cyberpunk" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/16c53ae5eadcd/dum-dum-cyberpunk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cd Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">has announced</a> a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on Switch 2, adding in four new cars and a boatload of improvements.</p>
<p>There's no release date for the update at the time of writing, but we'd wager it probably won't be too far off. It's hitting the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC tomorrow (that's <strong>17th July 2025</strong>). We'll let you know as soon as we get more details on the Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>For now, let's see what's in store, shall we?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Hunt</em> and <em>The Beast In Me</em>).</p>
<p>An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Beast in Me: Badlands</em>, <em>The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo</em>, <em>Transmission,</em> and <em>Search and Destroy</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete <em>Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...</em>).</p>
<p>If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing AutoDrive! This cutting-edge, autonomous driving feature will take you to your chosen destination (i.e. job objective or placed pin on the map). If you have no set destination, it will take you on a leisurely ride through the streets of Night City. Simply hop in any of your vehicles, make sure you're on a road, and hold H (PC) / Left Stick (consoles) to activate. This feature is disabled when you enter combat or when your vehicle is heavily damaged.</li>
<li>Implemented Cinematic Camera for AutoDrive. Hold Q (PC) / D-Pad Right (consoles) to activate. Sit back and enjoy cinematic views of Night City as you cruise toward your destination.</li>
<li>Self-driving Delamain cabs are now available on demand! Simply open the menu to call vehicles, then select "Delamain Cab" from the list to request a ride. This feature unlocks after completing the job <em>Don't Lose Your Mind</em> (regardless of outcome) and receiving a message from Delamain.</li>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ is now available for vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles. Additionally, the infamous hacker known as Cosmetic_Troll exploited a vulnerability and created a cracked version of Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology for lower-end vehicles. Please note, however, that some models do not support the technology, such as heavily modded nomad vehicles and job-related vehicles.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color schemes did not work properly on the Mizutani Shion MZ1 and MZ2.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color scheme could not be applied properly to the Villefort Deleon "Vindicator".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Photo Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added 27 new NPCs that can be spawned in Photo Mode, including Rita Wheeler, the Cassel twins, fixers, Dum Dum, the iguana, Brendan, and more.</li>
<li>You can now switch between alternative outfits for NPCs spawned in Photo Mode.</li>
<li>You can now switch between V's saved Wardrobe outfits in Photo Mode.</li>
<li>Added a confirmation pop-up when exiting Photo Mode to prevent accidental exits after setting up the perfect shot.</li>
<li>Added more customization options to the Look-At Camera feature, including an option for only the character's eyes to turn toward the camera instead of their entire body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Added improvements to Lighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added multiple new stickers and frames, including iconic quotes and stylish overlays that let you turn your screenshots into Night City postcards – perfect for sharing memories from the City of Dreams.</li>
<li>Improved Depth of Field and moved it to the Camera tab.</li>
<li>Added a new Color Balance tab, allowing you to create your own custom filters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Added a new Time and Weather tab:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Life &amp; Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game will now detect if the player is using inverted mouse button settings and automatically adjusts in-game button prompts accordingly.</li>
<li>Added an option to toggle aiming down sights in Settings → Controls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jobs &amp; Open World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Bloody Ritual</em> - the "Crack the ritualist's shard" objective now properly disappears from the Journal after completing the objective.</li>
<li><em>Sex on Wheels</em> - now properly appears in the Journal after receiving the message from Jake Estevez.</li>
<li><em>Shot by Both Sides</em> - fixed an issue where selecting a specific dialogue option in the conversation with Bree created a nameless, iconless item in the player's Inventory.</li>
<li><em>Shot by Both Sides</em> - fixed an issue where the button to go to the lower level didn't appear on the elevator panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when using a controller in Trauma Drama, the controllable character would default to shooting upwards instead of forward.</li>
<li>Players can now drop more Cyberware Capacity Shards if some within the intended drop limit were previously missed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing automatic weapons to fire slower than intended.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Official BARGHEST Tac Vest didn't drop from the scripted Airdrop as intended.</li>
<li>The level 60 Engineer perk no longer activates the EMP blast outside of combat or after entering a vehicle.</li>
<li>Added an option to replay the gameplay tutorial at any time via Settings → Controls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added an option to tell Johnny to go away after you look at him for a short while when he appears in the passenger seat. He takes the hint and disappears as a passenger for a couple days.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the sound of V's Radioport could be randomly interrupted by the Radioports of nearby NPCs.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where <em>History</em> by Gazelle Twin and Trash Generation played too loudly compared to other songs on the radio.</li>
<li>Improved the HDR Setting screen: fixed the HDR calibration preview so it correctly reflects the chosen settings, and clarified the description of the "Tone-Mapping Midpoint" setting.</li>
<li>Updated the End User Licence Agreement. You will be asked to accept it again when you load the game after updating.</li>
<li>Fixed several visual issues with missing, clipping, or floating textures.</li>
<li>Fixed several localization issues in various languages.</li>
</ul>
