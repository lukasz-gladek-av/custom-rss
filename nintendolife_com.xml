<p>But what could it mean?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a surprise new short film called '<strong>Close To You</strong>' and it's... not what we expected from the House of Mario.</p>
<p>Initially shared on the Nintendo Today! app before cropping up on YouTube and socials, the short follows a baby that learns to take its first steps via the magic of a sentient dummy (or pacifier, if you'd rather).</p>
<p>It feels very Toy Story, and the animation style has big Pixar energy to boot, but the strangest part of it all is how it feels very... un-Nintendo. There's no Mario to seen, the baby doesn't stumble past some Joy-Con at any point, there's not even a Pikmin cameo.</p>
<p>Or is there? It feels to us like there's something missing in this short. Don't you get the impression that we <em>should</em> be seeing something carrying the dummy or pushing the blocks? Do we spy something moving under the bed in the background <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsufGY5I8jA&amp;t=99s">around 1:38</a>? Doesn't the music sound a little <em>too</em> Pikmin-coded?</p>

<p>The whole thing has a whiff of an invisible Pikmin scheme to us, but hey, that's just a theory. Whether this turns out to be something bigger, well, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this animated short? Do you think it will be part of something larger? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>
