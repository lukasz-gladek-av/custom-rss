<figure data-uuid="e69e1dd540cf3"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e69e1dd540cf3/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game over screens — as a professional gamer, you understand — aren't something that I personally have a lot of firsthand experience with. Not through a lack of in-game skill, that's for sure.</p>
<p>However, as I'm also a highly learned and incredibly hirsute scholar of the interactive arts (also a compulsive liar), I <em>have</em> made it my very important business to die on purpose many, many times in order to familiarise myself with the very best and most important ways to come-a-cropper, as they say, in a video game.</p>
<p>Now, as we all know, there are some instant talking points within this particular topic, stuff that everyone is going to bring up immediately: your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">GTA</a> 'WASTED' screen; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">FromSoftware's 'You Died'</a>; and all of the very many unpleasantly hilarious ways you can be offed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat</a> series. These are cool, but they're all a little bit obvious.</p>
<p>The same goes for that lovely Bond-styled death animation for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">GoldenEye</a> on the N64 (something that got me very excited about life back at the tail end of 1997), and all those very well-written little comments and asides from Arkham's finest criminals when Batman falls in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Rocksteady's spectacular series</a>. All great ways to go, and all available to enjoy (or rage quit over) from the comfort of a Switch console, no less.</p>
<p>Today, though, instead of going with the more obvious choices, I want to pick out a bunch of the weirdest (or what I consider to be the weirdest) game over screens out there - and available to experience on Nintendo systems, if not your Switch. What are the strangest, darkest, oddest, most confusing, unusually brutal, or just-plain weird Game Overs I've seen with my poor little peepers (for research)?</p>
<p>Let's find out!</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="5759b23e8fa5f"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5759b23e8fa5f/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ZA/UM</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a> is up first here because it's sort of a cheat for this kind of list, given just how many ridiculous ways there are to get a game over screen, which is represented in-game as a newspaper clipping detailing your demise and/or downfall.</p>
<p>From ending a run because you got your tie stuck in a ceiling fan, or because a street urchin called you a slur, to taking too much psychic damage because of a romantic rejection, there's a lot to choose from. Honestly. Endless ways.</p>
<p>For me, though, the weirdest ending I've had is because I went to sleep in a dumpster. I mean, COME ON. I was tired.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body (Switch)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="b85276161d45a"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b85276161d45a/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body</a> is a terrifying game for many reasons. It's a weird one, a real oddball puzzler that had me squirming in my seat during sequences where demons are chasing me though my perverted, sweaty dreams. Or I've when I've suddenly turned into a very evil-looking goat.</p>
<p>However, it's the game over screen — which at a glance is totally unremarkable — that has stayed with me long after wrapping the game up.</p>
<p>Firstly, Vincent is lying in his pants (and they have hearts on them, cringe) in a pool of blood. Nightmarish enough, but then he also proclaims that "now's not the time to be dead" as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDLdwMI8xXU"><strong>Zigeunerweisen</strong></a> plays in the background and he resurrects.</p>
<p>What an absolute torturous nightmare of a scenario for the poor guy, a vicious circle of perverted poverty. Love is over, indeed.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan (N64)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="e51b759674685"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e51b759674685/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Eurocom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan</a>! Now what on earth is a game like this doing on a list of weird, oddball dark endings? A colourful family jaunt from the good old days that all the kids can play, as Tarzan makes his way through a lovely cartoon jungle full of friendly animaDIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! DIE TARZAN, DIE! DIEEEEEEEEEEE!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. But this is how it feels to die in this game, because the devs decided (and full marks by the way, it's a blinder of a surprise) to give us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0L9n89tJCY">a selection of game over screens</a>, the worst of which is your lifeless body being dragged away by a crocodile.</p>
<p>Yes, Tarzan, you are about to be dinner, and then toilet material. Dreadfully sorry, old chap.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie (Switch)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL</a> treats us to a wonderfully weird (and shifting) game over when we fail its tasks. No time is wasted before a very angry King of the Cosmos is shooting lasers at us whilst berating everything about us and wishing he'd chosen our stupid cousins for the mission instead.</p>
<p>Oh, and those lasers make you shrink. So be afraid.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> served up a real eye-opener with a game over screen that displays "...But The Future Refused To Change" upon death at the hands of Lavos.</p>
<p>This stark message conveys, very brutally, that the future is doomed and there's not a damn thing you can do about it now. You are dead and you have failed in the biggest way possible. Ouch!</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart (SNES)</a></h2>

<p>In the classic slice of 90s chaos, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart</a>, you play a level as Bart who has turned into pig form. Die as said pig and you'll be treated to a game over screen that sees Homer tucking into a box of corndogs.</p>
<p>He picks out one shaped as Bart, then goes ahead and eats him, quickly followed by another regular one on top. That is cold, man.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a> makes the cut here due to the sheer brutality of game over screens that see whatever character you happened to be pummelling everyone with tied to a pole. What's more, they are surrounded by dynamite which is about to explode.</p>
<p>So yeah. Punishment by being exploded. Wow.</p>
</div><div><h2>Friday the 13th (NES)</h2>

<p>This golden oldie was way ahead of its time in terms of cutting directly to the bleeding point (quite literally) by welcoming your demise with a game over screen that reads "You and your friends are dead."</p>
<p>I can tell you that, as a young child having a go at a game you probably shouldn't, that message certainly leaves an imprint.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure (N64)</a></h2>

<p>Okay, look. What if I just say, "Small pants muscle man rotating under disco lights, very small pants, sweaty...seems like it's going on in a dingy, smoky room. Please make it stop now."</p>
<p>Does that jog any memories? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/mystical_ninja_starring_goemon">Mystical Ninja/Goemon</a> games have a tradition. They've got form with these weird game over screens, but they went a step further in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure</a>, getting the game over dancer right down to a very small pair of underpants. And he's dancing.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">The Punisher</a></h2>

<p>Brutal with a capital B, you can find <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/punisher">The Punisher</a> on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Arcade Fighting Classics Collection</a> for Switch, and it's made the cut here because I have genuinely never forgotten it after having witnessed it first time in ye days of yore.</p>
<p>The scene in question involves you having CPR performed on your lifeless body by a desperate doctor as a timer counts down. Fail to continue and the doc is overcome with grief. Fairly dark stuff for a jaunt down the arcade, lads. Jeezo.</p>
