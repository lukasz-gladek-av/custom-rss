In February next year, it'll be joined by the brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> which is much more than a remake of Yakuza 3, says RGG Studio director Yokoyama Masayoshi.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2066901.html">GameWatch</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-include-major-hints-about-where-the-like-a-dragon-series-is-headed-rgg-studio-lead-says/">Automaton</a>), Masayoshi-san has said that this remake "contains some major hints about the future direction of the series."</p>
<p>"We haven't officially announce anything related to that yet," Masayoshi continues "But once you play it, I think you’ll get an idea, or rather, a pretty solid sense of what we intend to do with the series going forward.”</p>
<p>Well, considering there are five more mainline games (not including spin-offs such as Judgment or Gaiden) set <em>after</em> Yakuza 3, that's a little surprising!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e4f4ecc176b6f"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4f4ecc176b6f/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Dark Ties is the major new content, but other changes may well be coming — <em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of those are on Switch consoles either, and with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_infinite_wealth">Infinite Wealth</a> both starring a different protagonist (though Kiryu does pop up, because of course he does), it certainly leaves us with some questions.</p>
<p>Masayoshi also insists that the new story starring Yoshitaka Mine, Dark Ties, is "extremely shocking", stating that it's one of the "darkest" stories in the series' history: "if you think Yakuza Kiwami 3 is just a remake, you’d be hugely mistaken."</p>
<p>Well, even without that little hint, it certainly sounds like a lot more than a rehash of the original PS3 release.</p>

<p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties comes to Switch 2 on 12th February 2025. Will you be picking the game up? What do you think is in store for the series' future? Get pumped up in the comments below.</em></p>

<p>It might have been one of the worst-kept secrets in video games in the run-up to its official announcement, but yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is coming to Switch 2. In fact, it's arriving tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now, we were rather impressed with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> when it arrived on the new hybrid system back in September as the <em>first</em> open-world Ubisoft joint on the console, but who was to say that Shadows would perform equally well? If this very question has struck you in the lead-up to launch, have no fear, the above footage should answer all of your questions.</p>
<p>Alongside providing our full thoughts in our review, we have also captured 12 minutes of Shadows gameplay so you can get a taste of how the whole thing runs on Switch 2. The answer, fortunately, is that it runs pretty well.</p>
<p>The gameplay footage showcases all manner of different environments, including busy fight sequences, cutscenes and more serene open-world exploring, and while there is certainly some slowdown in particularly intense moments, things tend to stick to the targeted 30fps — always a welcome sight. Those who have played on beefier consoles will likely notice the step back in resolution and textures, but it plays it off pretty well in motion.</p>
<p>We took these minor technical hiccups into account in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">our review</a>, where we stated that Shadows "isn't a <em>perfect</em> port, then, but it’s still a colossal achievement and one of the best-looking games on Nintendo’s console".</p>

One of which happens to be Nintendo's very own Shigeru Miyamoto, which former Rare designer and director Gregg Mayles revealed <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1995198826211340653">on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Sharing a fax from the legendary game creator and director (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/former-rare-designer-reveals-what-shigeru-miyamoto-thought-of-banjo-kazooies-n64-sequel">Time Extension</a>!), Mayles says "Nice of him that compliment (in my mind anyway)" before explaining just what a fax is — to those youngsters online, of course.</p>
<p>The fax itself is a written notice of approval of the final rom of Banjo-Tooie, the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, with an additional note hand-written by Miyamoto in English which says "splendid game" with a little thumbs up and smiley face.</p><div><figure data-videoid="U-42JOukqJg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytU-42JOukqJg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4af2b0gnlrtp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>It's a cute little piece of history, and the timing is pretty perfect too — the game just celebrated its 25th birthday a few weeks ago, and we too (read: this writer) have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-banjo-tooie-is-pure-nightmare-fuel-and-i-wouldnt-have-it-any-other-way">fond memories of the follow-up</a>, which takes a bit of a darker, bigger turn.</p>
<p>Mayles left Rare earlier this year following a number of layoffs at Microsoft and the cancellation of Everwild. Back in October, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/banjo-kazooie-director-marks-departure-from-rare-with-a-poem">developer shared a poem on his final day at the studio</a>.</p>
