<figure><a title="Game-Key Card Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6c91250da4f4/game-key-card-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today published the transcript of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a>, in which company president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked to comment on the Switch 2's Game-Key Card releases. Unsurprisingly, he came to the defence of the format. Equally unsurprisingly, we're still not convinced.</p>
<p>As highlighted on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lsxagrh4tp2j">@oatmealdome</a>, the topic arose from one shareholder's announcement to the Nintendo directors that they have concerns about the Game-Key Card format. "I've seen opinions on the internet saying that Game-Key Cards are unappealing," the investor said, "I'm concerned that if third-party titles using Game-Key Cards don't sell well, it will discourage third parties from supporting the Switch 2".</p>
<p>It's a fair comment, particularly given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">discourse around third-party Switch 2 sales</a> in recent weeks, but Furukawa dodged the issue like a pro. "We introduced the Game-Key Card because game file sizes are larger on the Switch 2 compared to the Switch 1," the company president responded, "We have various ways to distribute games on the Switch 2, and we are working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform".</p>
<p>Let's quickly break that down, shall we? The first section feels like a no-brainer, explaining the very basics of the format, but for all the beefy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fictions</a>, it turns a blind eye to the smaller titles that definitely could fit on a cart. As for the second section, it all feels very focused on the publisher side of things, doesn't it? As if to say, 'Oh, you don't want a Game-Key Card <em>or</em> an expensive cartridge? Have you considered releasing <em>digitally</em>?'</p>
<p>It has been rumoured for a good few months now that Nintendo is <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">only</a></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">offering publishers a Game-Key Card or an expensive 64GB cart</a>. This has yet to be confirmed, and Furukawa was never going to disclose that kind of information in a meeting like this, but it might have been nice to get a little more reassurance about what "working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform" actually entails. Hey, we can dream!</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether Game-Key Card releases actually have all that much effect on sales, but for the time being, prepare to see them sticking around on Switch 2 for a while.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> is getting another First 4 Figures statue and if you're wondering what could be next, it's the classic and iconic title screen. To be precise, it's the screen from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> Sega Genesis release.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the official description, it's got Sonic's "signature smirk and finger pointed confidently upward" towards the winged emblem and the title banner. The final product may be <em>slightly</em> different and it's "coming soon" with pre-orders opening on <strong>8th July 2025</strong>. If you sign up to F4F with your email, you can also get $10 off when pre-orders go live. Pricing hasn't been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Along with the standard release, First 4 Figures will also be offering an "exclusive edition". Each statue will come with a limited edition numbering authentication card as well. As for the dimensions it's - <strong>W 14.7" / 37.5cm, D 7.4" / 19cm, H 8.2" / 21cm</strong>, and weighs <strong>4.8KG</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the other F4F Sonic figures previously released have been based on characters like Tails, Super Shadow, Amy, Knuckles, and even Metal Sonic.</p>
<p>In some other Sonic news, Sega recently revealed a <a href="https://youtu.be/dGFfyMB_GtA">partnership with McLaren</a> to promote the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.

<p>Update: It's still waiting on a dev kit</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-02T02:55:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 2nd Jul 2025, 3:55am</time>]:</strong> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> game director Guangyun Chen recently provided an update to the website <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-nintendo-switch-2-port-still-under-consideration-at-netease-if-they-ever-actually-get-a-dev-kit-for-it/">VideoGamer</a> about a possible Switch 2 release â€“ noting how the team is still "in the process of obtaining the development machine". Once it's acquired this, NetEase intends to "conduct a thorough evaluation" and will make a decision.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals will enter its <a href="https://youtu.be/kIhLPAWKKsg">third season 'The Abyss Awakens'</a> next week on 11th July and is available as a free download.</p>
<p>This update follows other developers claiming they're in the same situation with the Switch 2 and do not have development kits just yet.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:180920 @ 1751453815 --><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 15th Feb, 2025 05:30 GMT]:</strong></p>
<p>The popular team-based hero title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> has experienced an incredibly successful launch and as it continues to grow developer NetEase Games is looking at new ways to expand the experience. While it's reportedly ruled out a release on the original Switch, it seems there's a real chance of the game coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Speaking to IGN at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu mentioned how the team was "already in contact with Nintendo" and was apparently working on getting some development kits, so the decision will come down to how the game performs on the system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're already in contact with Nintendo and working on [getting] some development kits. And whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This goal to provide a "great experience" was the same reason the developer chose to not release the game on the original Switch. So again, as long as it can provide "great performance" on Switch 2, it's "open" to a release on this platform.</p>
<p>This 6v6 team-based free-to-play sees you assemble an "all-star Marvel squad" made up of characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man, and work together by combining strategies and powers. It's available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, and includes cross-platform multiplayer.</p>
