            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158411/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Taito may be famous for creating the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/space_invaders">Space Invaders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/bubble_bobble">Bubble Bobble</a>, but for a brief period at the close of the 1980s, it became the hottest name in arcades thanks to the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/operation_wolf">Operation Wolf</a>, a <strong>Rambo</strong>-inspired military shooter with a realistic Uzi strapped to its cabinet.</p>
<p>Ported to pretty much every home system of the era, the game was followed by sequels that expanded on the core gameplay but never <em>quite</em> achieved the same degree of fame. Fast forward to the present, and emulation specialist M2 has bundled up Wolf with <strong>Operation Thunderbolt</strong> and <strong>Space Gun</strong> — and thrown in the utterly superb <strong>Night Striker</strong>, a Super Scaler-style shooter inspired by the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_after_burner_ii">After Burner</a> for good measure — to create <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">Operation Night Strikers</a>.</p>
<p>Mindless shooting is the backbone of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">Operation Night Strikers</a>, then, and in lieu of proper light gun support, M2 has opted for a trio of potential control methods. You can use the analogue stick — which works well enough — or opt for using the Joy-Con's gyro controls. The third option involves a USB mouse.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158405/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The gyro-aiming approach has been used in titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">House of the Dead: Remake</a>, and it works better than you might imagine, thanks to the presence of an on-screen crosshair. This tends to drift as you play, but thankfully, you can recalibrate with a single button press during the action. Using a USB mouse will feel a <em>little</em> like cheating for light gun purists, but it is perhaps the best interface method of the ones available, assuming you've got a flat surface handy to rest it on.</p>
<p>All three light gun offerings here are excellent, with Operation Wolf giving you plenty to shoot at while its direct sequel spruces things up with more dynamic environments, all made possible by 2D scaling tech. Space Gun takes this to the next level, swapping out hostile military juntas for xenomorphs and cleverly simulating smoothly-scrolling 3D-style corridor sections with angled 2D sprites.</p>
<p>Night Striker is the outlier, as it's not a light gun game but one where you control a futuristic car which can instantly take to the air. It feels like a fusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/out_run">OutRun</a> (thanks to the branching pathways – although to be fair to Taito, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darius">Darius</a> features those, too) and Space Harrier, combined with some amazing <strong>Blade Runner</strong>-style locations and a wonderful Zuntata soundtrack.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158416/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>It's arguably the best game in this collection, and this pixel-perfect port even surpasses the one released on the Saturn and PS1 in Japan back in the '90s. It might be pushing it slightly to say the Night Strikers is worth the cost of purchase on its own, but it's certainly close – <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/m2s-night-striker-gear-gets-new-story-and-gameplay-trailer">and sets us up nicely for M2's forthcoming sequel.</a></p>
<p>Because this is an M2 release, you get the traditionally spot-on emulation as well as various CRT filters and other options, including online leaderboards. There's also a selection of information arrayed around the screen, which makes things like health and remaining bombs easier to parse; all of this can be toggled on and off at will. It's also possible to select between the US and Japanese versions of each game.</p>
<p>Also impressive is the fact that M2 has gone the extra mile and included the home ports that followed these coin-op releases (on my physical import copy, at least - they're available as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/operation-night-strikers-cs-pack-70050000060617-switch/">DLC</a> <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Operation-Night-Strikers-2890005.html">on the eShop</a>). For Operation Wolf, the Famicom, NES and Master System versions are present, but sadly, the PC Engine port isn't. Operation Thunderbolt's SNES conversion also makes the cut, but it's a pale imitation of the original game, despite offering six different characters to play as.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158406/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Not all of the ports allow you to use gyro aiming, and there's often quite a notable gulf in quality between them and the arcade originals, but they're still interesting to play. For many of you, the nostalgic pull might be stronger with these versions, as they may well have been your first experiences of these notable arcade releases.</p>
<p>Night Striker's Mega CD port is included, too, and while it looks like a blocky mess when compared to the coin-op, the sense of speed is impressive, and the arranged soundtrack is fantastic.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The notion of picking up a collection featuring three light gun shooters and a relatively obscure Super Scaler-style game might be a little too esoteric for some Switch owners, but hardcore Taito fans will have a blast (no pun intended) with Operation Night Strikers. The emulation is perfect, the control methods are decent, and there's plenty of customisation on offer, making this another highly recommended M2 offering.</p>
<p>Longevity is going to be an issue for some — even with the online leaderboards in place — and some of the included home ports are a little rough around the edges, but players of a certain age will find a lot to like here, given the legendary status of Operation Wolf and the quality of the other titles included.</p></section>

<figure><a title="LEGO Pokémon Logo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d0d78db27735/lego-pokemon-logo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: LEGO / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're still waiting for the official word on what next year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/its-official-lego-pokemon-sets-are-finally-coming-our-way-next-year">Pokémon LEGO collection</a> will look like, but a recent leak suggests that something <em>big</em> might be on the horizon (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/one-of-the-first-lego-pokemon-sets-will-reportedly-cost-650-and-be-the-seventh-biggest-lego-build-ever/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Over the weekend, a new post appeared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/">r/Legoleak</a> Reddit forum from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CarterBricks04/">CarterBricks04</a>, claiming to have information about the upcoming collection's first three sets. According to the post, these sets will go on general release on 1st March, with LEGO Insiders getting early dibs from 27th February (which just so happens to be the series' 30th anniversary). What's more, they're all apparently 18+ builds.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22frsoltn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The real juicy part of this 'leak', however, is in the sets' supposed prices and piece counts. The post claims that one set will measure in at 587 pieces with a $59.99 price tag, another will cost $199.99 and will contain 2,050 pieces, while the last will feature... wait for it... 6,838 pieces for the eye-watering sum of $649.99.</p>
<p>There's no indication of what these sets will be, but for reference, that last one's piece count would make it the seventh-largest LEGO set released to date, putting it between the Star Wars AT-AT (6,785 pieces) and Millennium Falcon (7,541 pieces) sets. For those wondering, the largest is the World Map build, which measures in at 11,695 pieces.</p>

<p>But wait, there's more! In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1n47ptf/promopokemon_february_gwp_insiders_reward_source/">follow-up post</a>, CarterBricks04 shared that an 18+ Pokémon-themed gift with purchase (GWP) would also be arriving on 27th February, with a 12+ "Nintendo-related" Insiders Reward going live on the same day for 2,500 Insiders Points.</p>
<p>It's a very exciting prospect (even if our wallets are already judging us at the mere suggestion of that price), but let's try to stay realistic here. This is still nothing more than a rumour for the time being, and while the Legoleak group has been on the money about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/rumour-animal-crossing-lego-it-may-be-coming-next-year-according-to-leaks">Animal Crossing</a> LEGO sets in the past, the official details for the Pokémon collection go no further than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/its-official-lego-pokemon-sets-are-finally-coming-our-way-next-year">initial announcement</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes peeled for an <em>official</em> first look in the coming months, but until then, we'll cautiously start saving our pennies — heck, whatever form the collection takes, you know it's going to be a pricy one...</p>

<p>Nintendo and Lego are back with yet another enticing collaboration; this time presenting a 421-piece replica of the iconic Game Boy.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>1st October 2025</strong> at <strong>£54.99 / $59.99</strong>, the new set will come with the Game Boy itself, two cartridges for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>, and lenticular 'screens' that make it look like you're actually playing a game. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>Now, thanks to Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino/videos">Tiago Catarino</a> over on YouTube, we've got our best look yet at the upcoming set. The 9-minute review provides a solid overview of the components, noting how the size of the console and cartridges is remarkably close to the real deal.</p>
<p>We also get a glimpse at how the lenticular sleeves are inserted into the main device, along with a demonstration of how the face buttons and d-pad work – yes, you can press them. We reckon it's only a matter of time until someone mods this thing to play real Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Lego really knocked it out of the park with their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/nintendo_officially_unveils_the_lego_nes_console_launches_next_month">NES replica set</a>, so we've got high hopes for this one. It's also, dare we say, quite affordable compared to some of the stuff Lego has put out over the years.</p>

<p>Ah, a blockade</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are mere days away from the Switch 2's next big port, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> gearing up for a hyperspace exit on <strong>4th September</strong>. Ubisoft has been pretty shy with Switch 2 footage so far (bar a sizzle reel appearance in the console's reveal Direct, and another brief look back in July), and if initial impressions are to be believed, there might be a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Outlaws' Switch 2 port has arrived at PAX West, giving all those in attendance the first chance to see how Kay Vess' planet-hopping adventure fares on the new Nintendo hardware. One such person to go hands-on with the game was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">GVG</a>'s Steve Bowling, who, despite revealing that Ubisoft allowed no direct-feed capture or over-the-shoulder recording during the preview, assembled his thoughts into a YouTube video. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't sound great.</p>
<p>According to Bowling, Outlaws runs "pretty poorly" on Switch 2, with both the game's resolution and framerate taking a hit to account for the scope of the open world and the technology under the hood. What's all the more concerning is that this comes despite the majority of the demo taking place in a relatively enclosed area — the early Imperial ship escape.</p>
<p>Even in these smaller environments, Bowling noted the "unstable, uncapped framerate", which apparently dropped below 30fps at several points during the demo. In a larger dogfight section, Bowling notes that the game simply "didn't look very remarkable", despite the ray-traced lighting and DLSS providing some neat visuals in more intimate moments.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like we might be in for a bumpy ride when this one arrives on Switch 2 later this week — heck, we have to assume that the PAX West demo is the finished version of the game with that tight of a turnaround. We'll be able to see it for ourselves soon enough, though we're getting those expectations tempered.</p>

<p>Well, in the US at least</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The recent Indie World showcase featured a rather curious word game for the Switch eShop, but chances are you may have missed it thanks to its initial exclusivity in Japan.</p>
<p>Fear not, dear reader! According to a new listing on the US eShop, '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/word_game">文字遊戲 Word Game</a>' is heading to the West (well, the US, at least – we've not yet seen mention of it on the EU eShop), and it'll be available later today for <strong>$34.99</strong>. Whoa, whoa, <em>whoa</em>... Hold up, that seems a fairly hefty price for a word game, hm..? Yes, we were surprised too, and truth be told, we're not <em>100%</em> clear on what the actual objective is.</p>
<p>From what we can gather, this isn't your average word game like Scrabble or Boggle and whatnot. Instead, you actually control an animated Chinese character and make your way through a series of puzzles. It looks fairly basic for the most part, but there are also moments of true ingenuity in which the words animate into complete new objects or creatures. You have to see if in motion to really 'get it', we reckon.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the official, totally-not-confusing description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Word game is literally a game of words.</p>
<p>Words are not only composing narratives and interfaces, but also representing objects, characters and scenes.</p>
<p>Player controls "I" to challenge puzzles composed of words.</p>
<p>When "I" appears a secret room, in-game narrative clearly tells "I" that "there is no door”. However, in the world of word game, “I" can walk through the "door” because there is a “door”.</p>
<p>“I" should find clues between lines, delete words to change the meaning of sentences, or shift words to rewrite facts. “I” must be wise and brave enough complete the mission of words.</p>
<p>May the best "I” win!</p>
</blockquote>
