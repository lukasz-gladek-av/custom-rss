<p>Pop Up, Superstar!</p>

<figure data-uuid="0ab8c7f0d20ff"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ab8c7f0d20ff/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>This week, London will be treated to its very first pop-up Nintendo Store, making all of us UK Mario fans clutch our wallets in fear.</p>
<p>The shop opens to the public tomorrow (<strong>22nd October</strong>) in the Shepherd's Bush <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london" rel="noopener">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a>, where it will be stocking its sweet merch until <strong>16th November</strong>. Those hoping to visit before 26th Oct will need to <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events/10540">book a ticket</a> to attend, but you'll be able to rock up as usual after this date — just expect some good old-fashioned queuing!</p>
<p>Before the doors <em>officially</em> open, we have been lucky enough to get a sneak peek at the store and see some of the wonderful goodies within. Keen to give all those hoping to attend in the coming weeks a heads up on what you can expect, we've assembled the following merch gallery, so you can start to prep those wishlists.</p>
<p>You might recognise some of the following pieces if you've spent much time browsing the Japanese Nintendo stock online, but this gives us a good chance to get our hands on it <em>without</em> booking a flight to Tokyo...</p>
<p>Let's start with some clothing, perfect for DK enthusiasts and Nintendo all-rounders alike:</p>

<p>There's home decor featuring the likes of Pikmin and Splatoon:</p>

<p>It couldn't be a Nintendo Store without plushies galore:</p>

<p>Some particularly neat figures of the statues found in the flagship Nintendo Stores in the US and Japan:</p>

<p>Plenty of Switch 2 merch and amiibo — you know, for those who <em>haven't</em> seen one yet...</p>

<p>And finally, the checkout, where bank balances weep into their exclusive pop-up store London tote bags</p>
<figure data-uuid="1f3737adccea0"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f3737adccea0/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We should note that there's no guarantee all of this merchandise will be on the shelves if you visit the pop-up later in its run — if there's one thing we've learnt about exclusive merch, it's that it sells out <em>fast</em>. That said, the store will be sticking around for a good while, so there's still plenty of time to visit if you find yourself in the big city.</p>
