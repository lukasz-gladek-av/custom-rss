<figure data-uuid="11af1244f7a70"><a title="Samus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11af1244f7a70/samus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Kensuke Tanabe, veteran producer at Nintendo who became known for his work on the <strong>Metroid Prime</strong> series, has reportedly announced his retirement.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">VGC</a>, Tanabe's announcement comes via an interview with the Japanese magazine <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/">Nintendo Dream</a>, which has been uploaded online by a user on <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574">Weibo</a>. Tanabe states that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> was to be his final game at the company, with his protégé producer Risa Tabata succeeding him should another Prime game be made in the future.</p>
<p>Tabata's first game with Nintendo was, coincidentally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> on the GameCube. She has since worked as an assistant producer on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/donkey_kong_country_returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/paper_mario_color_splash">Paper Mario: Color Splash</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">The Thousand-Year Door</a> on Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cewgixph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As for Tanabe, he reportedly states in the interview that he had wanted to create a Metroid title focused on Samus and Sylux since dropping subtle hints in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Prime 3: Corruption</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>. Realising that Prime 4: Beyond might be his last shot to do this, he decided to make it the first entry in the Sylux saga.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I envisioned Sylux as a dark, resentful villain who resorts to underhanded tactics. After this game, Samus would realize that a direct confrontation with him is inevitable – she must defeat him completely.</p>
<p>“That’s why the final showdown between Sylux and Samus remains unfinished. However, completing this game took far longer than anticipated.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanabe leaves behind a remarkable legacy at Nintendo. His first game with the company was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> in 1987 during which he served as director. Since then, he's transitioned into one of the most prominent producers at the company, working on everything from <strong>Luigi's Mansion</strong> to <strong>WarioWare</strong> and beyond, and we're certain he will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Tanabe-san.</p>
