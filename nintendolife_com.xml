<p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">IGN</a> alongside Bananza director Kazuya Takahashi, Motokura says that following "the original impetus" from his boss, Yoshiaki Koizumi, the first port of call for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> team was the office of the father of DK and Mario himself, to try and find the essence of the character and work out how to create the first 3D Donkey Kong platformer since 1999's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8xurwio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Miyamoto has experienced not only working on the Donkey Kong games that he was directly responsible for, but also worked alongside Rare on the Donkey Kong games that they created. And for him, a lot of things that came up were the unique actions that a really strong character like Donkey Kong can engage in, things like the hand slap or blowing his breath."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Motokura and co. also tapped Mr. Koizumi for his expertise with the ape, as the Nintendo veteran served as director on 2004's bongo-fest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_jungle_beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> on GameCube.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For him, one thing that was a really important distinguishing characteristic from a character like say, Mario, is that Donkey Kong has these longer, stronger arms. So we took all of these distinctive features of Donkey Kong as a character and tried to think about how we could bring them to play in a new game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interview, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">confirms the game's producer and director</a> after the Mario Odyssey team was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">revealed to be behind Bananza</a>, goes into more detail about the genesis of the project, with Motokura mentioning how experiments with voxel tech <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-like-mario-kart-world-was-initially-planned-for-switch-1">on Switch 1</a> became the foundation of the upcoming Switch 2 game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When we realised the compatibility of Donkey Kong's distinctive characteristics, being strong and having these large long arms, and the possibility of Voxel Technology, we saw that this was a good match that led us to the idea of pursuing destruction as core gameplay in this title."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it feels fairly obvious to use all the resources at your disposal when assembling your design ideas for a new game, it's still nice to know that Shigsy hasn't ascended to a marble-floored office in Nintendo HQ, not to be disturbed while he takes calls about theme parks and movies in his Mario t-shirt/sports jacket combo. It's good to hear younger devs can still knock on his door for advice, although we imagine he's not opposed to hitting the shop floor from time to time, either. Those tea tables aren't going to upend themselves.</p>
<p><em>Looking forward to DKB? It's out next week, so not long to go!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">Producer Kenta Motokura and director Kazuya Takahashi</a> explained that the game was being built on Switch 1 with the same voxel technology used to create the destructible environments. However, upon learning about the Switch 2, the team shifted development over to the new console to take full advantage of the increased specs.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the added power, however. The team were also keen to see how the new mouse controls could be implemented in the game. As demonstrated in the Direct presentation last month, you can used the mouse controls during multiplayer to initiate Pauline's vocal blasts.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8xurwio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's exactly what the team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Motokura</strong>: So this game originally began its development cycle on Nintendo Switch 1 and at the time, we were still using voxel technology and thinking of lots of different ideas for applications. But when we learned about the Switch 2 development, we realized that the best implementation of these ideas and technology would be on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Takahashi</strong>: And when I was previously talking about the importance of the continuity of destruction, that was something that we could expand on and have a longer continuous play experience with that kind of concept on Nintendo Switch 2. So this allowed us to engage in creating really extremely rich variety of materials and very large scale changes in the environment on that new hardware. And when destruction is your core gameplay, one really important moment that we wanted to preserve was when a player looks at a part of the terrain and thinks, can I break this? Because that creates a very important surprise that has a lot of impact for them and that was something that was best done on Switch 2.</p>
<p>But it's not really even just the processing power of the Switch 2 that I think attracted us and gave us some interesting possibilities. There was also the device itself that offered things like mouse control, which you can use in co-op play for a second player to control Pauline's vocal blasts or DK Artist, a mode where you can sculpt a large set of voxels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you remember, it was also confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/mario-kart-world-was-originally-in-development-for-switch-1">started life as a Switch 1 project</a>. As revealed in an Ask the Developer session over at Nintendo, the development team stated that "it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted" in the Switch 1 version, and so shifted the project over to the Switch 2; a move that supposedly provided "a ray of hope".</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is certainly shaping up to be something pretty special, and we can't wait to dive in properly when the game launches on 17th July 2025.</p>

<p>We knew that the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> has been busy working on Donkey Kong Bananza, but it's now been confirmed that Kazuya Takahashi is serving as the game's director, while Kenta Motokura is the game's producer.</p>
<p>Motokura previously directed Super Mario Odyssey and worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, while Takahashi only joined Nintendo back in 2020, bringing with him some key experience in open-world game design.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8xurwio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, the key question in our minds now is what this might potentially mean for the next 3D Mario title. With Motokura on producing duties for Bananza, does this mean he's also been busy creating a new Mario title? It's almost guaranteed at this point that <em>something</em> is in the works, but when and how it shows up is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is scheduled to launch exclusively on the Switch 2 on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>.</p>
