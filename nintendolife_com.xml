<figure><a title="Yomawari" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4627021c6556/yomawari.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're all on tenterhooks awaiting news of a Nintendo Direct that may never arrive, and publisher NIS has only upped the speculation after it accidentally lifted the lid on a new Switch 2 game before swiftly deleting the announcement post.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1md0f07/nis_announced_a_new_2026_game_for_ns2nswps5pc/">Reddit</a> forum by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joseki100/">Joseki100</a>, the Japanese NIS Twitter account was briefly home to the reveal of a new farming game in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yomawari_the_long_night_collection">Yomawari</a> series, accompanied by a 30th July 2026 release date. The post was swiftly removed, but not before more than a handful of people had nabbed a screenshot (you'll find it below, shared to BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/knoebel.bsky.social">Knoebel</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Running the reveal through Google Translate, this one appears to be called '<strong>The Garden of Honolulu</strong>', and seemingly boasts the same chibi art style as we'd expect from a Yomawari game. Naturally, we won't know anything for sure until the game is revealed properly (as in, for more than a few minutes), but hey, at least the key art looks cute.</p>

<p>Now, as many have pointed out on Reddit, the game does <em>feel</em> like a Direct announcement, one that was potentially scheduled too early and accidentally let slip before anything was made official. There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumblings of a July presentation</a> for a good few weeks now, and there are only two days left to fit in that window, so don your tinfoil hat as you will.</p>
<p>Whether it ends up being a sign of an upcoming Direct or not, it looks like we'll have another cute farming sim on our hands next summer. You can never have too many of those, right?</p>
