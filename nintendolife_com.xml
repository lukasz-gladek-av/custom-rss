<p>The quote from Koichi Fukazawa, director of the board and senior executive vice president, can be found on the <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20251107_q2_presentation_with_scripts_e.pdf">PDF presentation</a> from the Q2 financials release. He details an objective to sell a further 1 million copies of the game over the next fiscal year, which he hopes will be bolstered by the ongoing release of downloadable content.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xizjkl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I’d like to talk about Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>It has received high ratings, scoring over 80 on Metascore at “Metacritic” and earning an "Overwhelmingly Positive*1" rating on Steam's customer reviews. We recently announced that worldwide cumulative sales have surpassed 1 million units. However, initial performance did not meet our expectations, and we are aiming to sell approximately another 1 million units within this fiscal year. We aim to sustain long-term sales by encouraging players to enjoy the game over time through the continued support of the title including ongoing release of additional downloadable content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega notes that its overall performance in the first half of the current fiscal year has been somewhat disappointing, citing lower-than-expected sales in the gaming division along with Rovio's performance in the entertainment sector.</p>
<p>The presentation highlights <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</a> as a major full game release for the fiscal year, but we suspect it will probably want a few more big-hitters as the wider industry grapples with uncertain economies and price hikes across the board.</p>

<p>Coming to Switch later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>French studio Seed for Seed — the developer behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pile_up_box_by_box">Pile Up</a> and <strong>Jump the Track</strong> — is bringing its cosy co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/baladins">Baladins</a> to Switch on <strong>20th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Blending the tabletop co-operative experience with unique RPG gameplay, you and three friends can team up to explore Gatherac to help save the land, help the locals, and experience your own unique adventure. You can get a good feel of what to expect from the PC release date trailer up top.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a co-op experience, you can pick and choose what class/character you can play as, like a Cook, a Dancer, or a fire mage. Or you know, your typical RPG job — a Luxomancer, who can "think outside the box".</p>
<p>But biggest draw here is the choose-your-own-adventure approach. Your choices matter in this game, with every decision shaping your adventure, leading to a lot of replayability. Perhaps with different friends each time!</p>
<p>For a brief rundown on Baladins, here are some details from its Steam Page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Choose your own adventure!</strong> Bring joy to the people of Gatherac with 1-4 players and let your collective choices shape the fate of this unusual world.</p>
<p><strong>- Be a hero!</strong> Play as one of five unique classes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and watch your character grow as the story unfolds!</p>
<p><strong>- Play at your own pace!</strong> The story of the Baladins can be played in short sessions over the course of the whole campaign</p>
<p><strong>- Encounter a dragon!</strong> It wouldn’t be a fantasy roleplaying game without one!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yes, this might be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/icymi-paper-mario-styled-rpg-escape-from-ever-after-has-launched-on-switch">the second RPG of the day</a> with a <em>very</em> <strong>Paper Mario</strong>-like aesthetic, but Baladins is much different, as you've likely gathered.</p>
<p>The game launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866320/Baladins/">Steam</a> back in May 2024, and it sits on a Very Positive rating after 116 reviews — hopefully, this console release will bring the whimsical adventure to more people's attention.</p>
