            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Surprisingly, there was no <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> announcement to be found in this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Presents</a>, but an update reveal wasn't far behind.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has today lifted the lid on the new 'Wisdom of Sea and Sky' expansion, which sees Johto's very own Lugia and Ho-Oh take centre stage in a Gen 2-focused set. The above trailer gives us a closer look at the two legendary ex cards, a handful of full arts and shinies, and, of course, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. All of this will be arriving in the Pokémon TCG Pocket app on <strong>30th July</strong>.</p>
<p>While we're very excited to see the new set in action (it's a good year to be a Totodile fan), the biggest announcement for us was the reveal that the in-game trading feature will be getting a facelift on the same day.</p>
<p>From 30th July, you'll be able to make a wishlist of cards you'd like to trade for via the My Cards screen, so other players can see what you're after and make you an offer. You'll be able to select up to 20 cards for your wishlist, and pin three of them to your profile for all to see.</p>
<p>As promised, Trade Tokens will also become a thing of the past, replaced by the much easier-to-obtain Shinedust (which you get as standard with any repeat card pulls) for three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity trades. You'll be able to cash in your pre-existing Trade Tokens in the in-game shop for Pack Hourglasses or Shinedust.</p>
<p>After months of hardly touching the woefully consumable-based trade system, we might finally start to fill in the blanks in our collection.</p>

<p>The big new release of the moment, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, has sold a smashing 127,905 units in the week of 14th July to 20th July, but can't quite take the number one spot from the Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which shifted another 135,370 copies. DK, of course, was only available for part of the week, so we'll see how far its legs carry it over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Tropical Freeze</a> debuted on Switch with 88,421 physical sales, and on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Wii U</a> it debuted with 35,717 sales.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The only other new release of the week that cracked the top ten is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>, a fighting game based on the hugely popular manga and anime series. However, at least in terms of physical sales, it only managed to shift 3,174 copies on Switch, with other platforms outside the top ten.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tamagotchi_plaza">Tamagotchi Plaza</a> continues to do very well, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> remains in the top five with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> joining it — incredibly impressive given that we have that new Mario Kart. Nothing will stop it, eh?</p>

<p>On the hardware side of things, Switch 2 sales continue to climb as the new console has sold an extra 20k+ units this week compared to last — it shifted 152,165 this week compared to 128,643 last week. That's a nice boost thanks to DK, we reckon.</p>
<p>Once again the Switch OLED and Lite have outsold the PS5, with only the OLED managing to sell above 5,000 units. It's a bit of a drop from last week, but as more new games come to the Switch 2, we're sure more people will move over.</p>
