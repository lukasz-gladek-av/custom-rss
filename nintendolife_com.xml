<figure><a title="Other Games - Silksong Day" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/085fd316af72f/other-games-silksong-day.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many of you, today – <strong>4th September, 2025</strong> – will forever be known for one reason: the day that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally launched on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>But of course, while Silksong will undoubtedly soak up a <em>heck</em> of a lot of attention, the day doesn't just belong to one game. In fact, there are quite a few titles launching on the Switch eShop, and we'd like to highlight a few that we think deserve a bit of attention.</p>
<p>Yes, the brave souls behind these games have decided, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">unlike others</a>, not to delay their intended release in order to avoid clashing with Silksong. That warrants the doffing of one's hat, if you ask us. We're not going to cover everything launching today, because frankly the Switch is still being bombarded with some rather questionable games, but there are definitely a few that are worth looking into.</p>
<p>So if you're <em>really</em> not keen on checking out Silksong, then perhaps one of the following might be more up your alley...</p>

<h2 id="adventure-of-samsara"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a></h2>
<p>Atari's latest is a classic metroidvania that pays homage to the original <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from the Atari 2600. Developed by Ilex Games, its heavy, slow-paced movement and combat are almost the exact opposite to Silksong's more free-flowing gameplay. Still, we thought it was decent and awarded it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/adventure-of-samsara">7/10</a> in our recent review.</p>

<h2 id="camper-van-make-it-home"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/camper_van_make_it_home">Camper Van: Make it Home</a></h2>
<p>One of our favourite games in recent weeks was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>, which we described as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop">"epitome of cosy"</a>. Camper Van: Make It Home looks to provide the same kind of vibes, albeit with a lot more focus on meticulously decorating and rearranging the interior and exterior of your camper van. It looks lovely, and a fine way to escape from the drab reality of life.</p>


<h2 id="dark-deity-2"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a></h2>
<p>Developer Sword &amp; Axe made a point of sticking to its guns and launching Dark Deity 2 alongside Silksong, and we commend such bravery. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">The first game</a> was a lovely spin on <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>'s gameplay, and the sequel looks to take this even further. If you're into retro-inspired tactical RPGs, then this might be worth checking out.</p>

<h2 id="fling-to-the-finish"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fling_to_the_finish">Fling to the Finish</a></h2>
<p>This one admittedly wasn't on our radar, but upon viewing the recent console trailer, it actually looks like a whale of a time. It's one of those multiplayer games where you have to work alongside a partner to reach the end of the level. The twist here is that you're literally tied together with an elastic band, and so you need to fling your partner up walls and across gaps to succeed. It's got local and online support with cross-platform compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="splatterbot"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a></h2>
<p>Do you like <strong>Splatoon</strong>? Of course you do, for goodness' sake. Well, Splatterbot is remarkably similar in that you face off against up to three local competitors to make the most mess in each stage. So each player (or team) is designated a certain colour, and all you have to do is cover as much of the ground as possible while slamming into your enemies to knock them off-course. It looks awesome!</p>

<h2 id="mandragora-whispers-of-the-witch-tree"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a></h2>
<p>Another action RPG to add to the list, Mandragora appeared on other consoles recently and has now joined the fray on the Switch. We're not completely sold on the visuals here, but the artistic design is solid and the gameplay looks like it could potentially scratch that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> itch.</p>

<hr>
<p>So that's yer lot! Reckon we've missed anything here? Then let us know with a comment down in the usual place. And no, we're not including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> here; that one's big enough on its own thanks to Ubisoft and Disney. We'll have a review for you soon though, don't worry about that!</p>

<figure><a title="007 / Hitman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68598632611c7/007-hitman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Judging from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-that-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">recent gameplay reveal</a>, IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> is looking pretty marvellous, and it's heading to the Switch 2 on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, in speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-first-light">IGN</a>, game director Hakan Abrak has revealed that IO managed to secure the video game rights to James Bond in a rather amusing (albeit not entirely surprising) way. Essentially, the studio took the (digital) head of Daniel Craig, the most recent actor to portray Bond, and stuck it on Agent 47's body from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3wstruj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The team then demonstrated how a Bond game would work by exploring the Sapienza level from 2016's Hitman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We actually did put Daniel Craig in there. We just modeled his head and put it in instead of Agent 47, just for demo purposes, giving an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game. And if you are acquainted with the franchise, there is a level called Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound. So we showed some things off there and, yeah, it was well received.</p>
<p>"I think what they saw in us and what we are also conveying is our angle would be to try to deliver a 360 experience where it's not necessarily about only shooting and cut scenes — there's certainly that in our game as well — but it's also being able to explore the part of the Bond fantasy where he is in social spaces where he is using not only his fisticuffs, but also his charms and bluff and figuring out different ways in those social spaces to overcome the obstacles or get what he wants. How would a charming Bond fare in a situation like this where he doesn't have to necessarily resort to violence?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, we reckon it's safe to say that folks weren't exactly shocked to discover that IO, who really did tremendous work on the Hitman series, would be the ones to bring James Bond back into the world of video games. Hitman is basically Bond, but... maybe a bit more violent. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a fun little story about how that project came to be, and we can't wait to check out the full game next year. 007 First Light will be available via a standard edition priced at <strong>$69.99 / €69.99 / £59.99</strong> along with a deluxe edition priced at <strong>$79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99</strong>.</p>
