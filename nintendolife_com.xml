<p>Last time, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hey_you_pikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a> for the N64, and although neither version was particularly popular, it was the North American version that won the day with 61% of the vote.</p>
<p>This week, we're back with the <strong>Metroid</strong> franchise with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>, the excellent GameCube follow-up to the Retro Studios original. Released in 2004, it introduced the now-iconic Dark Samus to the series while showcasing an awesome dual-world environment in which a deadly species known as the 'Ing' attack Samus and rob her of her core abilities.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Overall reception was positive, with many praising its continued gameplay and intriguing storyline, though some criticism was made toward the game's high difficulty and limited multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Its the west vs. Japan this week, so let's get to it!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:192886,174452 @ 1761483984 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="727ea50c27067"><a title="Prime Echoes - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/727ea50c27067/prime-echoes-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're all familiar with this one, right? It showcases Samus in a pretty cool action pose, while in the top left, we can see U-Mos, the last remaining Luminoth on the planet Aether. In the bottom right, meanwhile, we can just about make out the Ing, and this makes for a lovely little representation of the light and dark shifts we see in the game. Lovely stuff.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="df0b1e0b514c2"><a title="Prime Echoes - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df0b1e0b514c2/prime-echoes-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach is interesting, not least because it contains an odd little release date advertisement over on the right. Why..? Who knows. Otherwise, this is mostly a showcase of Samus herself, however the change in colours as we move toward the right indicate the encroaching presence of Dark Samus.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's also called 'Dark Echoes' here, for reasons!</p>

<p>Give Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken a new look</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>McDonald's Japan recently teamed up with Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> series to offer a new range of burgers.</p>
<p>If you're not able to make it to Japan in time to taste test each one, this might be the next best thing. The global fast food restaurant is now offering free codes for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> which unlock "McDonald's EX" colours for certain characters. This includes different colours for select Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken outfits.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c5375a50981e"><a title="McDonalds Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c5375a50981e/mcdonalds-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom, McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's each code via the McDonald's Japan social media account. To unlock each colour in the game, you'll need to navigate to the options menu and scroll down to "Input event code". From there, you can redeem each outfit colour.</p>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ryu)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>M3L4-WJAK-8FCH-6AYV</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Chun-Li)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>CDU9-BBPC-DNQU-98M9</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ken)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>LFCU-8RYT-7MP9-RH8F</li>
</ul>
<p>Nintendo Life can confirm these codes can be redeemed in local copies of Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2. You can redeem these codes on other platforms as well. Just keep in mind, to access these colours, you'll need to have unlocked or purchased the specific outfit for each character.</p>
<p>These codes can be redeemed until <strong>12th December 2025</strong>. There's also a McDonald's EX colour for M.Bison, but this is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1ogaq3r/comment/nlfd6qe/">apparently a gift</a> region-locked to Japan.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 arrived alongside the Switch 2 in June. You can find out more about it in our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo shadow-dropped the new mobile game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> in September. If you haven't given this free-to-play title a go just yet, now might be the time to take a look.</p>
<p>A new story "and more" has been added in a free update. Book 2 - Wolf Brother adds episodes 1-4. You can unlock the chapters by collecting Story Fragments earned as battle rewards. You'll also need to complete Book 1 before you can dive into this new content featuring the character Joachim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unsettling footsteps approach a small, impoverished village quietly tucked away deep in the mountains…A kind boy from a cold village in the northern mountains who rarely seeks conflict. He's a descendant of wolves from the bloodline of Fenris. You can unlock him by battling and collecting Book 2 Story Fragments."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with this, there's also a new labyrinth map, and new weapons and skills have been added as treasure rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The feature rewards this time are Soul items for Lyn: Plain Wind. Collect 12 of these to recruit Lyn as one of your disciples."</p>
