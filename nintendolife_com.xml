<p>One of the most unique video games of 2024 was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/indika">Indika</a>, a third-person adventure game where you play as a nun who has a connection to the Devil itself. It's a surreal, absurd adventure and it addresses faith, religion, and authority with a darkly comic (and tragic) tone.</p>
<p>And now, Odd Meter's extremely unusual title is coming to Switch on <strong>17th November</strong>, with a physical version following over a week later, on <strong>28th November</strong>. The above trailer (via Gematsu) <em>really</em> doesn't give away much except that there's nothing else quite like it!</p>
<p>But, if you need a little encouragement, just last month, Indika won the Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards, presented by none other than <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> and <strong>Kirby</strong> maestro Masahiro Sakurai.</p>
<p>At the ceremony, Sakurai gave the audience some background on the game, and detailed what makes it special — in the form of a short movie. Well, it's a lot of recorded gameplay with some explanations of some of the mechanics.</p>
<p>Sakurai praises the variety, the atmosphere, the story, and the questions it pushes onto the player (approximately translated via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLPvWz3_lY">the Japan Game Awards stream</a>).</p>
<p>For more details on the game, we'll throw it over to the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Surreal Journey Through 19th-Century Russia<br></strong>Set in an alternative Russia at the turn of the 19th century, <em>INDIKA</em> follows a young nun as she ventures beyond the monastery walls, accompanied by the most unexpected companion imaginable: the devil himself. What begins as a simple errand quickly transforms into a surreal and darkly comic odyssey, exploring themes of faith, authority, comedy, and tragedy with a uniquely inventive twist.</p>
<p><strong>Meet Indika: Not Your Ordinary Nun<br></strong>Indika appears to live a quiet, monastic life, but her unlikely friendship with the horned tempter drags her into a world where the sacred collides with the profane. Every step reveals new mysteries and challenges, immersing players in a story reminiscent of Dostoyevsky’s depth and Bulgakov’s surreal humour.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a Bold Indie Vision<br></strong>Developed by Odd Meter, <em>INDIKA</em> blends atmospheric exploration, dark humour, and inventive puzzles across surreal landscapes. Its distinctive style is punctuated by 2D pixel-art mini-games that reveal hidden layers of Indika’s past.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br></strong>- Third-person, story-driven adventure with darkly comic tones<br>
- A young nun’s journey of self-discovery across a surreal reimagining of 19th-century Russia<br>
- The devil as an unlikely and mischievous companion<br>
- Puzzle-solving and exploration interwoven with narrative<br>
- Surreal, atmospheric environments with striking visual design<br>
- 2D pixel-art mini-games that illuminate Indika’s backstory</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Our sister site Push Square reviewed the game back in May 2024, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/indika">were full of praise</a>. One for the radar, we think.</p>
