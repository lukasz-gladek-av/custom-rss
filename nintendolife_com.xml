<p>The Nintendo version launched in July of this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c45ef279a6a5/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo, 2K</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just months after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> on the Switch 2, 2K Games has now revealed the title's server shutdown date.</p>
<p>As of <strong>14th March 2027</strong>, all online features and services will end for the title. Offline services like Play Now, Showcase MyRISE, MyGM and Universe will continue to be playable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scheduled Online Services Retirement Date</strong></p>
<p><strong>WWE 2K25:</strong> "Online features and services are scheduled to be available until 14th March 2027."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the title a two-year lifespan since its original release for <em>other</em> platforms on 14th March 2025. Based on this, the time frame is even less for Nintendo players as the Switch 2 version was only released on 23rd July 2025. The physical version of this particular entry is also a "code-in-box".</p>
<p>Ahead of the shutdown of WWE 2K25, 2K will also end online services for <strong>WWE 2K24</strong> on 5th January 2026.</p>
<p>Although the winding down of online services in games doesn't appear to be stopping any time soon, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">'Stop Killing Games' consumer movement</a> has been attempting to challenge the legality of publishers "destroying" certain video games sold to customers by revoking access following the cessation of online support.</p>
<p>Recently, a video game lobbying group in Europe (made up of major players in the game industry including Nintendo, Microsoft and more) put forth an argument that maintaining online support indefinitely could have a "chilling effect on game design" and act as a disincentive to make such games available in particular regions.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and WWE 2K25 in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Capcom's Switch library is also on sale</p>

<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8af306929e64e/street-fighter-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been hanging out for a Switch 2 eShop bargain, it seems the first major third-party one has arrived. Capcom is currently offering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which was a launch title for Nintendo's new system in June) for half price in the US.</p>
<p>This takes this title, which has now surpassed five million combined sales globally, from $39.99 down to just $19.99.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is the base game, so the DLC and Season Pass content is locked off, but there's still a lot on offer. This includes three major game modes and a roster of 18 fighters, including new faces and returning fan favourites. It also features some special gyro game modes exclusive to the Switch 2 version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7xhpotl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
