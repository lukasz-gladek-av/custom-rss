<p>According to Insider Gaming, a new job listing from Sledgehammer Games - seeking a "Senior Technical Artist" - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/">has surfaced on LinkedIn</a>, and in the 'Bonus XP' section of the application, the team notes how it would appreciate someone with "AAA mobile or Switch experience".</p><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdiyktmr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Although Sledgehammer only provided support on the latest Call of Duty title, it has previously taken the reins for major titles such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3"><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This small discovery follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">an update earlier this year in June 2025</a>, with a report at the time suggesting Microsoft and Nintendo still had plans to announce <em>something</em> related to this series in the future.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Nintendo originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">entered a 10-year commitment</a> to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the deal becoming legally binding in 2023. This was followed by Microsoft being given the all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition in the same year.</p>
<p>According to a previous story, Sledgehammer Games is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-office/">rumoured to be releasing its next Call of Duty</a> title in 2027.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-technical-rundown-detailed-by-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>1367008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1c4b88860f604"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c4b88860f604/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is out for the Switch 2 next week, and ahead of launch, Ubisoft has published a "deep dive" about the technical aspects of this port. Here's the rundown:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="frame-rate">Frame Rate</h3>
<p>Firstly, in both docked and handheld modes, the frame rate will target 30 fps. The resolution was not included here.</p>
<h3 id="adapting-to-switch-2">Adapting to Switch 2</h3>
<p>As for adapting the title to this system, the team says it has done <em>a lot</em> of "code-level work" to optimise and adapt the game architecture. This includes "modifying game assets to streamline certain technical aspects of the quality" without compromising the overall player experience.</p>
<p>"Behind the scenes, we've worked a lot to make the world run smoothly and remain visually stunning and dynamic... For example, we're using the same cloud and cloth simulation systems, but we've optimized certain elements for the ARM processor and downscaled simulation data where needed to reduce GPU load, all while preserving visual fidelity."</p>
<p>Although the Switch 2 supports Ray-Traced Global Illumination, the team opted to use its solid baked Global Illumination system (which it also uses for "low-spec PC setups and Xbox Series S versions" of games), citing "RAM memory reasons" as the main decision behind this. It apparently allows the developers to preserve the overall experience as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h3>
<p>In terms of optimisation – Level of Detail (LOD), draw distances, texture resolution and element loading were all "carefully adjusted to maintain performance without compromising the world's depth" - with the environmental richness of the world still "largely intact". However, NPC counts have been reduced in highly populated areas to maintain "smooth gameplay".</p>
<h3 id="dlss">DLSS</h3>
<p>DLSS has also been utilised, resulting in a "sharper image, with more accurate colors, improved textures, and fewer visual anomalies". Performance is described as being "smoother, offering higher FPS through upscaling, better fluidity, and reduced latency".</p>
<h3 id="handheld-and-docked-experience">Handheld and Docked experience</h3>
<p>The same post goes into more detail about each mode on Switch 2 – explaining how handheld mode is GPU-limited, with adjustments to image quality, draw distance and LOD settings to prioritise performance. And in docked, players can expect HDR support. VRR is also leveraged in handheld, offering "smoother gameplay".</p>
<p>One feat, in particular, is how "the lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 fps, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 fps on Switch 2" and the team "didn't want to compromise on that aspect" so it built a "dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 fps" to ensure the experience remains as "fluid and responsive as possible".</p>
<h3 id="switch-2-specific-features">Switch 2-specific features</h3>
<p>Last but not least are some Switch 2-specific features including touch screen navigation for menus and maps. Nintendo players can also expect this version to include "all post-launch content" excluding the "Claws of Awaji expansion" due out in 2026. Cross-progression is supported as well via Ubisoft Connect, so you can continue your adventure across platforms.</p>

<p>Nintendo continues to promote its latest game releases with new events in its mobile runner <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and next up is a collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p>
<p>This event is already underway and like previous events, you'll be able to unlock themed statues. For this particular one, this includes statues for Bee Mario, Rosalina and Balloon Yoshi. During this event, one course will be open a day for free.</p>
<p>Here's a look at each of these statues, with the event scheduled to run from now until <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2992fd063fde2"><a title="Super Mario Run" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2992fd063fde2/super-mario-run.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows previous Super Mario Run events for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brother Ship</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo released Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 on the Switch last month. If you haven't already played it, we can confirm it's still out of this world, even if the entire package comes at a high price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There’s no question about it: Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the most sublime games ever created. With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages...These games command a high price on Switch, to be sure, but you’ll be playing them for the rest of your life."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Kirby has proven his absolute dominance in the region once again, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> getting off the start line in style with a sweet 195,594 sales under its belt.

<p>Elsewhere, last week's chart-topper in Konami's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/momotaro-dentetsu-2-anata-no-machi-mo-kitto-aru-higashi-nihon-hen-plus-nishi-nihon-hen-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Momotaro Dentetsu</a> board game sequel has tumbled down to fourth and sixth on Switch and Switch 2 respectively, leaving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> to fill out the remaining spots on the podium. Oh yes, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> pushed past the big 100,000 sales.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adqgkinl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Switch 2 hardware sales have seen an expected boost by the presence of a new exclusive Kirby in town, with the console finding itself comfortably at the top of the hardware chart with an additional 126,953 units to its name. It has also been a strong week for PS5 sales, mind you, with the Digital Edition achieving 23,381, and the Pro even overtaking the Switch Lite and standard models with 11,367.</p>
<p>All this means that combining the console SKUs swings things in Sony's favour this time, with the three PS5 units clocking in at 36,920, while the Switch 1 models combine for 29,370.</p>

<p>The Final Masterpiece</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a welcome surprise! Hot off the back of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Bloober Team has shared with us the <em>next</em> project that it's working on for Switch 2, and it's none other than an all-new <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> package.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a> will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>19th December</strong>, bundling together <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, every DLC expansion, and brand-new chapters into one spooky edition fully optimised for the new system.</p>
<p>There are the added bonuses of HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, too, <em>and</em> you have the option to play with motion controls or touchscreen inputs if you see fit. Here's the official blurb from Bloober Team and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Layers of Fear</em> is a first-person experience that blends story-driven exploration, environmental puzzles, and psychological horror. The Final Master Edition brings together the intertwined stories of three characters — the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer — each consumed by their devotion to art. The atmosphere is elevated by a chilling yet hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by award-winning musician Arek Reikowski. Rebuilt with HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, this edition deepens immersion in its melancholic and spine-chilling world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all sounds like a pretty strong way to experience these psychological horror titles. The full Final Masterpiece Edition will be available on the eShop for <strong>$39.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) next month — because the holiday season <em>really</em> needs some more scares, right?</p>
<p>For those curious, we had a perfectly good time with Cronos: The New Dawn when it arrived on Switch 2 back in September, describing it as "a celebration of survival horror, paying homage to all the genre greats effectively, although failing to do anything truly original" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">our review</a>.</p>
