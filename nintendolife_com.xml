<p>So let's take a look at the new information...</p>
<h2>Yakuza Kiwami 3</h2>
<p><strong>- Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami Style Combat –</strong>Players can now enjoy the most attack techniques in the series' history and brand-new Heat Abilities in addition to fan favourites from the original Yakuza 3.</p>
<p><strong>- Ryukyu Style Combat –</strong> Rooted in Okinawan martial arts, this battle style’s base stance utilises a tinbe and rochin, a traditional shield and short spear. Simply mash or hold down the buttons to weave in flashy sai, nichogama, tonfa, tekko, nunchaku, eiku, and surujin attacks. Kiryu can power up by maxing out his gauge and activating his Dragon Boost.</p>
<p><strong>- Ability Upgrades –</strong> Kiryu's ability upgrades now give him access to his most diverse skill set to date. Complete missions and undergo training to mold Kiryu as you see fit or customise his cell phone to boost his motivation, taking his abilities to new heights.</p>

<h2>Dark Ties</h2>
<p><strong>- Mine’s Story</strong> <strong>–</strong>The year is 2007. Yoshitaka Mine had once launched a successful startup, only to be stabbed in the back by a trusted partner. Wandering Kamurocho in a drunken stupor, he witnesses a gruesome conflict between yakuza factions. After watching a subordinate of Daigo Dojima sacrifice themselves, Mine longs to discover what makes a bond transcend material gain.</p>
<p>He approaches Tsuyoshi Kanda of the Tojo Clan's Nishikiyama Family in hopes of learning more about Daigo. Kanda welcomes him in as his sworn brother and right-hand man. Working in tandem, they bring significant wealth into the family's coffers. Soon, the Tojo Clan catches wind of Mine and Kanda's actions and springs into action. As Mine and Kanda navigate their way through this crisis, Mine begins to feel a sense of kinship toward Kanda and shortly after receives a sudden invitation from Daigo Dojima.</p>
<p>-<strong>Ruthless Combat –</strong> An elegant fighting style based on shoot-boxing, players can exploit openings in their opponent's defence to deliver refined combos and beat down enemies, and dash freely through the air to overwhelm foes with unpredictable movement.</p>
<p>- <strong>Dark Awakening Mode –</strong> Mine builds up his Shackled Heart by attacking enemies and can spend it to trigger Dark Awakening, a mode that empowers Mine. Using Dark Awakening, Mine drops his facade, revealing his true ferocity and transforming his battle animations and techniques. Mine possesses many stylish, cold-blooded Heat Actions, including an all-out barrage to the face and a brutal gut punch.</p>
<p>- <strong>Ability Upgrades –</strong> Mine's upgrades refine his combat abilities, improving his techniques and unlocking mid-air Heat Actions. A number of upgrades to Dark Awakening are also available.</p>

<p>This will go down well</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="97803bc08af8a"><a title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/97803bc08af8a/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has laid out plans to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks with generative AI by 2027.</p>
<p>This comes via a progress report on the company's <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">'Square Enix Reboots and Awakens'</a> business plan (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">VGC</a>) in which it hopes to turn its fortunes around and become a true industry leader. It states that it has initiated a partnership with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at "improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies"</p>
<p>So as part of this, Square Enix is looking to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks with generative AI, with hopes to "improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development".</p>
<p>The partnership is currently comprised of "researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory UTokyo, and engineers from the SQUARE ENIX group", resulting in a team of over ten members.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e4397d300ab87"><a title="SE Report" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4397d300ab87/se-report.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, this decision will likely be met with mixed reception from fans. On the one hand, QA is said to be a tedious task, but ultimately utilising more and more AI is just going to result in more job losses. And who knows just how accurate AI will prove to be when diagnosing issues? It's a tricky one.</p>
<p>Square Enix's announcement comes just after EA launched a new partnership with Stability AI to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p>
<p>EA had presumably predicted the negative response to this announcement, and stressed that human creators will still be the driving force at the company, stating that AI "can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream".</p>
