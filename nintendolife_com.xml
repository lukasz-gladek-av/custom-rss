<figure data-uuid="7fc8ef16a4588"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fc8ef16a4588/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the massive Switch 2 sales out of the gate, Nintendo's shares have been slipping throughout December, dropping as much as 4.7% yesterday. Why? It seems fears surrounding chip shortages may be to blame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) estimates that Nintendo's market value may have already decreased by as much as $14 billion this month, as Switch 2 RAM module costs have leapt up 41% in the quarter.</p>
<p>It's not just RAM either. The console's NAND storage has also seen an estimated 8% price rise, as both SanDisk and Samsung have delayed shipments of flash chips due to "increased demand from large data centres and hyperscalers", according to a <a href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/1996105253545279875">recent statement</a> from SSD manufacturer Transcend.</p>
<p>This shortage explains the pricy state of microSD Express cards — the <em>only</em> expandable storage method for Switch 2 — which regularly sit at the best part of $200 for the beefy 1TB option and around $60-$80 for the smaller 256GB. "This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed onto the gamer," Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Of course, the holiday season is near-enough guaranteed to be a big one for Nintendo and the Switch 2. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">upped its sales forecast</a> from 15 million to 19 million Switch 2 sales by the end of the financial year, and its impressive start is nothing to be scoffed at.</p>
<p>But consoles cost money to make, and if memory costs stay on the up-and-up, who knows what the company will need to do to keep its profits moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>Creature comforts</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a> launched on Switch last year, and we were particularly enamoured by it. Developer Wishfully quickly followed it up with the announcement of a sequel, '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Children of the Leaf</a>', and the latest gameplay trailer promises it will be every bit as cute as we'd hope.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's Unity Awards Showcase, the '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWoUwHXShgQ">Say hello to the Roller</a>' trailer introduces us to one of the many cute creatures you'll encounter on Lana and Mui's journey, one that possesses a particularly sticky set of skills.</p>
<p>Using Mui's transforming abilities, these cute fluff balls can stick to walls and ceilings, leave flammable trails, and roll along narrow corridors undetected. They are also really freaking cute, which is always a bonus — just try not to become too attached to them by the end of the trailer, you have been warned.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release date for Planet of Lana 2 just yet, though Wishfully and Thunderful have confirmed that it'll be coming our way at some point in <strong>early 2026</strong>. That leaves you a good bit of time to catch up on its predecessor, if you haven't already, which we described as "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan – perhaps even destined to join that short list of classics" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

<p>Is Larian's popular role-playing series back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8199459c2ebe6"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8199459c2ebe6/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're just days out from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-game-awards-2025-time-date-and-how-to-watch">The Game Awards</a>, and one marketing stunt that's got <em>a lot</em> of attention in the lead up to the show is a mysterious statue located in the middle of the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>It's ignited plenty of speculation online, and now a trio of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity</a> trademarks, which were filed in Europe on 9th December 2025, appear to confirm it's an announcement related to Larian's popular role-playing series. As you can see below, the symbols match the statue:</p>
<figure data-uuid="d33bce385024d"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33bce385024d/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: MP1st</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the news this week of a PlayStation 5 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition</a> being added to Sony's servers. Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse responded to this, mentioning how the team <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">wasn't "meant to announce that yet"</a>. Douse has also supposedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/">ruled out Divinity Original Sin 3</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions of Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition were <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/new-divinity-logo-and-symbols-trademarked-matching-mystery-the-game-awards-2025-statue#google_vignette">rated by PEGI in November 2024</a>, but they haven't been released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yihsvk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/mystery-game-awards-reveal-is-a-new-divinity-rpg-as-riddle-is-finally-solved">our colleagues at Push Square</a> note, this could even be a "double-header" of announcements including "a re-release of Original Sin 2 on new-gen consoles and a fresh announcement for the franchise".</p>
<p>If we hear anything on the Nintendo front, we'll let you know. Larian previously released Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition on the Switch eShop in 2019 (<a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/010027400cdc6000">and it's compatible with the Switch 2</a>), but we're sure many fans would embrace a next-generation upgrade.</p>
