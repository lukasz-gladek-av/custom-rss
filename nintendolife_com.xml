<p>The countdown to a physical release begins</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Playtonic and PM Studios have today released a free Switch 2 demo for the throwback platforming remake <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, giving you a chance to try before you buy.</p>
<p>You'll find the new demo on the Switch 2 eShop right now, and, you'll be pleased to hear, all the data carries over to the full game — so there's no time wasted if you choose to go all-in on the full release afterwards.</p>
<p>The demo announcement kicks off Playtonic's 10-day countdown to the release of the Yooka-Replaylee physical, which launches on 18th December. This boxed release bundles in a map and some stickers alongside the pièce de résistance, the full game on a cartridge.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we had a good time with Yooka-Replaylee at launch, saying that it "feels like the game that Yooka-Laylee was always meant to be" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>
