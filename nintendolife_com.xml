<p>How is it holding up?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is out now for the Nintendo Switch 2, and our pals over at Digital Foundry have presented their tech verdict on the new title from developer AAA Games Studio.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it's pretty decent! With its 40GB+ file size, the game utilises dynamic resolution scaling, with docked mode putting out anything between 720p and 900p, while handheld mode delivers between 468p to 648p. DF states that these resolution targets are generally pretty good considering the effects-heavy gameplay.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's improved specs over its predecessor means its able to render a whole bunch of overlapping effects alongside dozens and dozens of enemies on-screen, all running at 60fps. Meanwhile, enemy complexity is much improved over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, and multiple effects light up the surrounding terrain impressively.</p>
<p>Frame rate, as mentioned, sticks to 60fps for the most part, however DF states you'll "easily" spot moments in which the performance drops slightly. It's nothing egregious, mind you, and you're not really going to get anything below 50fps, so it seems to be a pretty stable game overall.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that if you jump into local co-op mode via split-screen, you're going to be getting 30fps instead of 60. That said, if you have two Switch 2 consoles at hand, or even if you use GameShare, you can play co-op with a much smoother 60fps.</p>
<p>For even more in-depth analysis, be sure to check out Digital Foundry's video and article down below. You might notice that we've not included such articles in our recent DF pieces, and that's because the team has recently joined forces with Hookshot Media to create its own website – huzzah! Congrats to all involved.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ce2730dafbe3e"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce2730dafbe3e/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released the English translation of its recent financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf">Q&amp;A session</a>, and it mostly covers the company's plans for the Switch 2, its games, and potential movies going forward – lots of stuff we already know about, to be honest.</p>
<p>One question, however, managed to raise a smile on our otherwise stone cold faces, and its regarding the late president of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, who passed away in 2013 at the age of 85. One attendee essentially asked what kind of comments Yamauchi would make if he were to evaluate the success of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Shigeru Miyamoto said that Yamauchi might feel "a sense of envy" at the fact that the Switch 2's numbers are so high. Otherwise, he would remain humble and advise the company to "keep your feet on the ground and do the right thing".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Hypothetically speaking, if (former president) Hiroshi Yamauchi were still alive and evaluated the current state of Nintendo Switch 2, what kind of comments do you think he would make?<br>
<strong><br>
Shigeru Miyamoto:</strong> Yamauchi, as president of Nintendo, might feel a sense of envy that the numbers have surpassed those of his own tenure, but in a typical Kyoto business executive manner, I think he would say, ”Stay humble. Keep your feet on the ground and do the right thing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a nice moment in what is otherwise a pretty straightforward Q&amp;A session. As you'll no doubt already know, Yamauchi was instrumental in transforming Nintendo from a company that specialised in Hanafuda to a global leader in the world of video games.</p>
<p>So yes, we imagine he would probably be both envious and thrilled at just how well the Switch 2 is doing so far. Since its launch back in June, the console has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">already sold over 10 million units</a>, with Nintendo upping its forecast up to 19 million units for the financial year.</p>

<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we're keenly aware that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> just hasn't had enough, well, airtime.</p>
<p>Look, two Directs clocking in at 1 hour 45 minutes (yes, longer than <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>) just isn't enough, gosh darn it! So we want to rectify that.</p>
<p>Nintendo kindly invited us to give Kirby Air Riders a whirl, and so we've put together a 20-minute+ video of gameplay for you to peruse at your leisure. We get a good glimpse at some races and the City Trial mode, and while it's not direct-feed, it's pretty good quality nevertheless, if we do say so ourselves.</p>
<p>Don't forget, you can try out Air Riders for yourself with the Global Test Ride, kicking off this weekend for Switch 2 owners. For a proper look at what times you'll need to set aside, be sure to check out our full guide down below.</p>

<figure data-uuid="6640c6788f849"><a title="Game Boy Color" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6640c6788f849/game-boy-color.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We sometimes take for granted just how different Nintendo is now when compared to the '90s and '00s. In the year 2000, for example, <strong>Pokémon</strong> was arguably at its height, the Game Boy Color was flourishing, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> was delighting and baffling fans in equal measure.</p>
<p>To really get a feel for how the company presented itself back in 2000, '<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:porwhxzwut6vszlqjcvnmmag">Nintendeal</a> guy' Andrew Wolf has scanned and uploaded a rare <a href="https://archive.org/details/nintendo-company-guide-2000/page/n37/mode/2up">Nintendo company guide</a> online. Clocking in at 44 pages, it's relatively light on text (which, understandably, is in Japanese), but there's a load of images and iconography to pore over.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the pages depicting individuals holding the Nintendo logo like a pair of binoculars – what's that all about?</p>

<p>Otherwise, there's a really cool early look at the Game Boy Advance which, as shown on page 8, is depicted with a <em>very</em> rudimentary image. The accompanying text highlights it as "Nintendo's futuristic Game Boy, a complete model change for the 21st century".</p>
<p>We also get a brief introduction from the late Hiroshi Yamauchi, a segment dedicated to Rare, images of the consoles and games that were very much in vogue at the time, and more.</p>
<p>A solid preservation effort from Mr. Wolf, then!</p>
