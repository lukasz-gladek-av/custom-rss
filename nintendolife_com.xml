<p>Alongside GameStop's exit from the New Zealand market</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="33deec88e9222"><a title="EB Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33deec88e9222/eb-games.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Last week, we got an update about GameStop's EB Games business in New Zealand, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/gamestop-kicks-off-2026-by-reportedly-shutting-hundreds-of-stores">38 stores in the country would be closing</a> at the end of this month. At the time, no information was provided about the future of the 336 Australian stores, but we've now got some details.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dont-freak-out-a-handful-of-australian-eb-games-stores-are-closing-this-month/">local Nintendo fan site Vooks</a>, the video game retailer will be closing "at least" 10 stores across Australia this month, and many have already shut their doors. One of these stores includes an EB 'Zing Pop Culture' shop, which specialises in merchandise, trading cards and various other items.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytvEee42ub-Hw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>No other details about these closures have been shared, but it is the end of the financial year for parent company GameStop, so underperforming stores (or shops not extending their leases) sometimes get cut. This isn't the first time this has happened in Australia, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/gamestop_subsidiary_eb_games_closing_19_unprofitable_stores_across_australia">around 20 "unprofitable" EB Games stores</a> closed down under in 2020.</p>
<p>EB Games, originally named Electronics Boutique, began in Australia in 1997 and started operations in New Zealand in the year 2000. It was then acquired by GameStop in 2005. If we hear any other significant updates about these EB Games store closures (or GameStop shutdowns in general), we'll let you know. Find out more about the closures in our previous story:</p>

<p>Last week, the PlayStation Blog revealed a demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> would be released on PlayStation 5. It's now been officially confirmed for the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>It should be live on the Switch 2 eShop very soon, and will give players access to both games. However, it's been confirmed the save data from this demo will <em>not</em> be carried over to the full game when it launches.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what you can expect from the demo when it rolls out on the Switch 2 eShop (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-demo-launches-january-21-for-pc-january-22-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-2">via Gematsu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this free demo, players will experience both games included in the two-games-in-one, action adventure beat ’em up.</p>
<p>In <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, players can explore Ryukyu, Okinawa as Kazuma Kiryu, beating down bad guys while dynamically switching between Kiryu’s brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami and weapon-based Ryukyu styles and indulging in immersive side experiences like karaoke, sub-stories, outfit customization and more.</p>
<p>In <em>Dark Ties</em>, players can enjoy a slice of the all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine, exploring Kamurocho and variety of side experiences while also sinking their teeth into Mine’s shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</p>

<p>Research firm Niko Partners reveals what could drive an increase</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="183d44b69aa41"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/183d44b69aa41/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past year, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/even-more-xbox-price-increases-make-ps5-look-like-a-good-deal">have been hit with price increases</a>. It's inevitably led to questions about the Switch 2 getting a price hike in the future.</p>
<p>Although there has been no official announcement from Nintendo about a price increase at this stage, the video game business intelligence and consumer insight firm <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-2026-predictions/">Niko Partners</a> believes a "global price hike" for the new system is likely on the way this year. It shared this in its latest "predictions" piece for 2026, which suggests Nintendo may even "opt to discontinue" the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or "higher" priced bundle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We believe the Switch 2 is set to follow in Sony and Microsoft’s footsteps with its own price hike driven by the impact from tariffs, increased memory costs, and broader macroeconomic conditions. Nintendo chose to maintain its $449 entry price last year despite the introduction of tariffs impacting production in China, Japan and Vietnam. More recently, increased demand for AI data centers has pushed RAM and storage prices up.</p>
<p>"While we do anticipate Nintendo to increase the price of the Switch 2, they may opt to discontinue the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or higher bundle SKU instead."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendos-president-remains-coy-on-potential-price-increases">recently asked about a possible price increase</a> for the Switch 2 this year and said he couldn't "comment on hypotheticals". However, he did acknowledge the current memory prices, stating at the time, how it had no "immediate" impact on Nintendo's financials but the company would continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>This latest prediction from Niko Partners follows a story last week about the discovery of a "mystery code", which quickly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mystery-product-code-sparks-rumours-of-a-new-switch-2-model">sparked rumours about a new Switch 2 model</a>.</p>
