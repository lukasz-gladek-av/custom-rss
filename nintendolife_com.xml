<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Main Racer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/65ffcde0730e0/mario-kart-world-main-racer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After the best part of a decade with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a>, we'd wager that you had probably grown pretty close to your main. You know, your <em>main</em>. The character that you picked to sit behind the wheel, regardless of the situation, because their weight class, look, or general vibe matched your playstyle perfectly.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> came along and shook those mains up. A new batch of racers have been added to the mix, but a huge batch have also fallen off the roster (pour one out for the Koopaling mains out there). After two weeks of open-world racing, huge swathes of us have found ourselves pivoting to a <em>new</em> racer, either drawn in by the shiny new faces, or rebounding from the loss of our go-to picks.</p>
<p>The question is, have you pivoted from your old main and if so, who's your new go-to racer? A handful of us Nintendo Lifers have shared our picks below, but you can take to the comments to let us know yours too.</p>

<h2>Mole in One (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Monty Mole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41701a1150375/mario-kart-world-monty-mole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My Mario Kart 8 sweetheart, Roy, was one of the many faces lost to the abyss, so I came into World knowing that I'd have to find somebody new. I was tempted by Cow, but she quickly got too mainstream. Goomba appealed to my usual Lil' Guy preference, but lost my attention. Birdo made a good play for top dog and is still first on my reserves bench. But none of them stuck as much as Monty Mole.</p>
<p>I'm yet to work out whether there's anything that keeps pulling me back to this little fella outside of the fact that he bashes his belly when he's pleased with himself (he just like me, fr), but regardless, he has been my go-to racer through thick and thin so far. The lack of outfits is upsetting — come on, Nintendo, give all the bad guys a couple of looks! — but stick this underground underdog in a Biddybuggy or Pipe Frame and <em>boom</em>, instant dopamine hit.</p>
<p>The lore may state that nobody likes him, but Monty Mole is quickly becoming my best pal.</p>

<h2>Drivin' on Sunshine, whoa-oh (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="MK World 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9113762b2b1b2/mk-world-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everybody should know by now that I have a major soft spot for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, so of course my go-to is going to be Sightseeing Mario. It's basically the closest I'm going to get to a direct visual reference to Sunshine in 2025 (other than Pianta, I know, shut up), so I'll take it.</p>
<p>Combined with the Funky Dorrie vehicle – which basically looks like a dolphin-themed jetski – I can cruise about the world in <em>ultimate</em> style. And look, I couldn't give a hoot if it's not very good in terms of stats; It looks awesome, and that's all that matters!</p>
<p>Bonus points if the combination also lines up with the Isle Delfino track from MK World's exceptional soundtrack. Pure bliss.</p>
<h2>Pipe frame's my main frame (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Waluigi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df5c6f368eb3a/mario-kart-world-waluigi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new racer? Nope. Waluigi on a pipe-frame kart. Always. Job done.</p>
<p>I know people like to analyse driver weights and kart velocity and coin-speed percentages and all that game, but I can't be doing with any of that crap. For Time Trails, perhaps, but that's not what the main game's about.</p>
<p>Seriously, in a series with rubber-band items that you can win <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/04/weirdness_you_can_play_and_win_in_mario_kart_8_deluxe_without_touching_the_controller">by doing absolutely nothing</a>, I'm not farting around with anything beyond, 'Yep, the lanky <strong>Lazy Town</strong>-lookin' dude in a sombrero, please.'</p>
<p>And I always choose the pipe-frame because it reminds me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">MK64</a>, my first Mario Kart. For the same reason, I'll <em>sometimes</em> I'll choose DK in lieu of Waluigi, as he was my go-to back in the '90s. He dabs a lot these days, though, and I lose a tiny piece of respect for him each time he does.</p>
<h2>Pretty fly for a shy guy (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Conkdor" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f72367b6f22dd/mario-kart-world-conkdor.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am a steadfast Shy Guy sort of person, it's a character that speaks to me on many levels, and he's been my go-to for a long time now.</p>
<p>However! I was tootling around in Mario Kart World the other night when I happened to unlock Conkdor, and let me tell you something...the moment I saw those killer purple shades, that tiny spiky shell, and a poker face that could put Robert Shaw out of business, I knew it was time to take my racing style to the skies. I'm actually considering a tattoo. I have become one with the Conkdor.</p>
<p>Perch said bird on my current cart of choice, the incredibly bad-ass Baby Blooper, and I believe you'll find I'm quite unbeatable. Until I'm not.</p>
<h2>Racing for Boo-ty (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World King Boo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc5d1e159c276/mario-kart-world-king-boo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seems like I can't shake old habits. As much as the many new NPC characters make me laugh (Cow, Penguin... Sidestepper???), I have once again gravitated to my favourite spooky sovereign, King Boo.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> boos. They're super adorable, and some of my favourite stages in classic Mario games are the Boo Houses. Giving a big boo a <em>crown</em> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> was just an easy win. He's been one of my mains since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Double Dash</a>, but in World, he's usually donning the Pirate outfit. A crown <em>and</em> some jewels? He's heavy (but not too heavy), and on the R.O.B. H.O.G., he's an unstoppable</p>
<p>Another Double Dash main I keep returning to is Toadette, but mostly because she's cute. The Soft Server outfit? Come on. Look at those sparkles and those glasses. But King Boo will always be number one.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>There are our picks, but what about you? You can let us know your Mario Kart World main in the following poll — and no, we haven't listed all the outfits too, so if your main has a particular look, you'll have to select the character and then let us know their wardrobe of choice in the comments below!</em></p>

<figure><a title="Former Nintendo Marketing Leads Fear We Might Be Waiting A While For A 3D Mario On Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a31a8afd8f7d/former-nintendo-marketing-leads-fear-we-might-be-waiting-a-while-for-a-3d-mario-on-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that the reaction to the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-so-will-you-be-getting-donkey-kong-bananza-for-switch-2">overwhelmingly positive</a>, and the perception of the already-anticipated Switch 2 title has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>In fact, DK's next 3D adventure looks <em>so</em> good that some people speculate it might be the work of Nintendo's biggest and most talented development team: Entertainment Planning &amp; Development (EPD).</p>
<p>EPD, as we're sure you're aware, created the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and is expected to be the force behind Mario's first 3D outing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't stated which team is working on Donkey Kong Bananza, but Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang—two former senior Nintendo staffers—have speculated that it <em>might</em> be EPD, which ties in with rumours we reported on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/05/rumour_the_next_donkey_kong_is_being_developed_by_the_super_mario_odyssey_team">all the way back in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Ellis believes that EPD could be developing the game, and if that is the case, "we might just be waiting for a good long time before we get the next 3D Mario game. That team is incredible; nobody's disputing the quality, [but] they are not fast, they are not prolific, they are not pumping out games."</p>
<p>In response to this comment, Yang says that we could be waiting between four and five years for Mario's big 3D debut on Switch 2, which would make it a mid-to-late generation release for the console. Yang also speculates that Nintendo isn't making any announcement on the development team for fear of upsetting those who are eagerly anticipating a 3D Mario in the next year or so.</p>
<p>Nintendo has a history of working with external studios on some of its biggest titles, with Bandai Namco being a regular contributor. It also has had several studios within its extended family which have worked on the Donkey Kong franchise in the past; UK-based <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/sacred-spaces-rares-manor-farm-hq-nintendos-90s-hit-factory">Rare</a> (now owned by Microsoft) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">famously rebooted the character back in 1994</a>, and, more recently, Retro Studios gave Kong a new lease of life on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/donkey_kong_country_returns">Wii</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Wii U</a>.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th.</p>

<p>With 947,931 consoles sold at launch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">the Switch 2 overtook the 630,552 set by Sony's second PlayStation</a>. We now have the console's second-week figures in, which make for some interesting reading. The hybrid system's first-week momentum has slowed, as you might expect, but it has now sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-wont-slow-down-surpasses-1-million-consoles-sold">1,101,136 systems in its homeland.</a></p>
<p>This robust performance means that Switch 2 has already outsold the combined lifetime sales of the <em>entire</em> Xbox Series family in Japan—that includes the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2020/11/hardware_review_xbox_series_x_-_the_fastest_most_powerful_xbox_ever">Series X</a> (320,762), <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-whats-the-difference">Series S</a> (337,811) and Series X Digital Edition (20,854)—as well as the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5-pro-an-impressive-yet-inconsistent-upgrade">PS5 Pro</a> (221,181).</p>

<p>Given the notoriously weak performance of Xbox hardware in Japan, this won't come as a shock to some people, but it's still pretty incredible that Nintendo has been able to leapfrog Microsoft's family of systems in Japan in such a short space of time.</p>
<p>It might have some way to go to overtake the PS5's lifetime sales in Japan, of course, but with that figure standing at 5,690,661—and taking into account the Switch 2's explosive debut—we wouldn't bet on it taking very long.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 also got its first big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">stability patch</a>, which is nice, and it's also been reported that third-party launch games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">didn't sell quite as well as publishers would have hoped</a>, despite the Switch 2 getting off to a roaring start.</p>

<p>Now, it's time to kick back and relax with some games, so let's see what we're up to this weekend...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:183939 @ 1750526354 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I finally picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> last weekend and have been enjoying noodling around the past couple of evenings. I’m only an hour or two in at this point and it’s yet to really get its hooks in me, but I’m sure a good sesh this weekend will help that along a bit.</p>
<p>I’m also really fighting the urge to replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> after that Donkey Kong Direct. Maybe I’ll just hop in to mop up a few more moons… maybe…</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>If you'd have told me that my most-played games on the brand-spanking new Switch 2 would be GameCube titles, well... yeah, I would've believed you. I love that I can just whip out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> while my daughter watches utter rubbish on TV.</p>
<p>I am, however, putting quite a few hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>. I must admit, I've been struggling to really settle on something now that most my launch review responsibilities have been fulfilled, but Yakuza really hooks you from the start, and I'm really enjoying my time with it. It looks great and runs like a dream.</p>

<p>While at times lately it feels like my brain is slowly mutating into a Switch 2, I’ve not had as much time as I’d like with some of the games I’ve been most looking forward to on it. I’ve played so much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> though, lemme tell ya.</p>
<p>Life gets complicated sometimes, but this weekend sounds like it’s gonna be easy! So that means I’m diving headfirst into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. The music, the characters, the combat! Ugh! I’ve already played Chapter 1 and 2, but with 3 and 4 now available, I’m planning to refresh myself with a new playthrough because my brain is mush and I don’t remember as much as I’d like…and I also want to relive those silly moments with Lancer and Spamton!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'll be chipping away at Cyberpunk and otherwise scanning my library and making space for some more kid-friendly fare ahead of a family trip (in addition to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">51 Clubhouse Games</a>' ever-reliable Ludo board, natch).</p>
<p>Despite not being truly grabbed by Free Roam in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, I'm still dipping in now and then to explore, so it must be doing <em>something</em> right. A little more of that too, then. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a> is proving to be quite a good surprise on Switch but most of the weekend will be spend in the streets of Kamurochō. I would probably be far more advanced plotwise in Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut if I did not stop to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/out_run">OutRun</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> every time I pass by the arcades, not even mentioning the bowling alley, the Shogi club, the Mahjong club, the batting center… yeah, now I remember why I kept postponing getting into SEGA’s flagship series: These games are made to keep you constantly distracted while having a fine time while at it. Also, what is up with this clean cut, civilised Goro Majima!?</p>
<p>Meanwhile on PC, having terminated (ah) my first time campaign playthrough of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/terminator_resistance">Terminator: Resistance</a> (a brilliant game I missed upon release) I am quite keen to at last start up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>. You know the drill: my generation was brought up on these movies and we are now living in a distant future where video game technology allows us to "live out" these franchises via our joypad. Sadly, we do have to buy them for way more than a dollar.</p>

<p>I'm still spending time in Night City and marvelling at the performance on my undocked Switch 2.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I’ll be revelling in the utter chaos of online Mario Kart World, including the great new knockout mode, which is both infuriating and humbling.</p>
<h2>Michelle See-Tho, Contributor</h2>
<p>Instead of getting Switch 2, I’ve gone back a few consoles and am playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">Pokémon SoulSilver</a> on DS. It’s so much fun seeing the series in its heyday (it’s literally the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1750503536509000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AEl_TN9xdMpQgSA-5fkRV" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time">number one rated game here on NL</a>). The little puzzles, the fun characters, the many many mechanics… They don’t make ’em like this any more.</p>
<p>Other than that I’m cosying up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a> – a slightly more recent classic.</p>

<h2>Tom Massey, Contributor</h2>
<p>Being unable to get in on the Switch 2 right now I’m doubling down on my Switch 1, and going firmly old-school with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>.</p>
<p>I’m working on a long-time-coming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_castlevania_iv">Super Castlevania IV</a> one credit clear, and I was so close on my last attempt I’m already haunted!</p>
<h2>Ethan Zack, Contributor</h2>
<p>It’s another heaping plate of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut for me this weekend. After years of wanting to jump into the franchise but feeling a tad overwhelmed by the scope of it all, I figured that this enhanced port launching next to Switch 2 was as good of an opportunity as I was going to get.</p>
<p>I’m having a blast working my way through the story but, man, I can feel the other games I need to play piling up as I sink hour after hour into this one. Some days I don’t even make progress — I just play darts for an hour, eat a burger, and then go on some insane side quest to beat up a cult leader. In the words of one Frank Reynolds, <em>“Oh my god…I get it.”</em></p>
<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm writing in from Singapore, where, sadly, the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to go on sale. I'm woefully behind the curve but hopefully, by this time next week, the next-gen Ninty console should already be in my hands.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fantasian_neo_dimension">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, the latest from <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The game's diorama-style landscapes look incredible on the Switch OLED, and the battle system offers a unique twist on turn-based combat. I have a deep reservoir of nostalgia for PlayStation-era Final Fantasy, and this scratches the itch for what it's worth. So I'll be chipping away at that until my Switch 2 arrives, and then it'll finally be time for Mario Kart World. Better late than never.</p>
<h2>Nick Ransbottom, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm still wrapping my head around playing Cyberpunk 2077 in the palm of my hands so I'll be making my way through Night City this weekend while cozied up in bed.</p>
<p>I'll also be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. And if I have time, I'll finally be starting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>.</p>

<p>Fans are already calling for a Switch 2 port</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Lies of P" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24c2c3299b595/lies-of-p.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It's been a difficult year for the video game industry at times, but there are still plenty of success stories out there and the latest one is a sales milestone for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studio.</p>
<p>While we don't have anything to report here about a Switch 2 release (<em>at least for now</em>), according to South Korean publication <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec (via VGC)</a>, Korean publisher Neowiz is rewarding every member of the local development team with Nintendo's brand-new system after the success of the new DLC 'Overture' and more than three million cumulative sales.</p>
<p>It doesn't end there, with the team also getting launch bonuses (of roughly $7,300) and two weeks paid vacation on top of the country's "mandatory 15 days of paid vacation". And hey, there's all that time to enjoy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and many other games!</p>
<p>Sure enough, this news has resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lg3ono/lies_of_p_devs_get_bonus_paid_holiday_and_switch/">Switch 2 and Nintendo fans calling for a port</a>. The action RPG with "soulslike" elements launched on platforms like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as well as the next-generation systems in 2023, so maybe there's a chance. For now, soulslike fans with a Switch 2 can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> as well as FromSoftware's new multiplayer game.</p>
<p>When this game was originally released on the PS5, our pals at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p"><strong>Push Square</strong></a> awarded it eight out ten stars – calling it a "first-class" souls-like experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lies of P feels like the result of a developer having already taken multiple stabs at the Souls-like genre, so it's impressive that Round8 Studio has accomplished so much on its first attempt. By fully embracing its dark take on the Pinocchio story, it sets itself apart from anything else available. Elevating it above other games are quality combat and extensive, satisfying customisation, turning Lies of P into a first-class experience for FromSoftware fanatics."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, this isn't the only team to be gifted Switch 2 recently, with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/stellar-blade-dev-says-nothing-confirmed-regarding-switch-2-port-rumours">Stellar Blade studio Shift Up</a> also handing out the new Nintendo system to its employees.</p>

<p>"Put the pedal to the metal"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're a racing fan and are looking for something else to play on the Switch 2, you'll pleased to hear <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> is now compatible on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>Developer Feral Interactive has provided an update on the state of the game – confirming it's now ready to race on the new hardware. There was apparently an "issue that was blocking startup" that's now been resolved in the latest Switch 2 firmware update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feral Interactive:</strong> "Switch 2 racers rejoice! The high-octane thrills of GRID Autosport are now playable on your shiny new console! An issue that was blocking startup has been fixed by the new Switch 2 firmware update, so grab yourself the latest version and put the pedal to the metal!"</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="PH9AJiL5EQ8" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PH9AJiL5EQ8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>The eShop game page for GRID Autosport includes the following notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Updated 06/19/2025 - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>

<p>GRID Autosport originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">made its debut on the Switch in 2019</a>, with a multiplayer update patched in at a later date. While the performance was already decent on the Switch, the experience should be even more enjoyable on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This is one of many third-party Switch titles to benefit from Nintendo's latest firmware update for the Switch 2. You can find out more in our previous coverage and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility guide</a>.</p>

<p>According to updated listings, Nintendo has been able to work its magic and reduce the game's file size from 10GB down to 8.5GB. It's not all that much, but given the size of various other titles on the Switch 2, we're sure many users will appreciate the extra space.</p>
<p>Although this game is less than half the size of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (which had a file size of 21.9GB at launch) it will still be packed with many sub-layers to explore.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067oqtpsn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches exclusively for the Switch 2 on <strong>17th July</strong>, with the new amiibo arriving on the same date.</p>
