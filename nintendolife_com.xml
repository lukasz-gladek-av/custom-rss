<p>"Throw down anytime, anywhere"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During the Switch 2 Direct in April, 2K announced it would be bringing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k">WWE 2K</a> series to the new hybrid system at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Now, in an update from the official 'WWE games' social media account, it's been revealed a "WWE2K25 announcement" is apparently "coming soon". The trailer signs off with a familiar sound effect and animation, along with the following date: <strong>1st July</strong> <strong>2025</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You never know when the next match will begin… Be ready to throw down anytime, anywhere. #WWE2K25 Announcement coming soon"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When 2K originally revealed it was bringing WWE 2K to the Switch 2, it also announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k">NBA 2K</a> would be released on the platform as well. This follows the release of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a> on the platform and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is also expected in the future.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-tests-out-switch-2s-free-switch-game-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-digital-foundry-tests-out-switch-2s-free-switch-game-upgrades.1231098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The team at Digital Foundry has been investigating <em>every</em> aspect of the Switch 2 and they've now taken a look at the free Switch game upgrades for the new system. These were delivered by Nintendo at launch and included frame rate and resolution improvements as well as other updates enhancing the overall experience.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie tested a handful of these games in their latest video – starting with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> (which had patchy performance on the Switch), these games now run at a consistent 60fps at higher resolutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's borderline like a free remaster, it genuinely feels like something they [Nintendo] could have released for a price, and I'm glad they didn't."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s free upgrade has also been positively received – with the resolution in docked going from "about a dynamic 900p" to a "dynamic 1800p". As for the frame rate, it's now "locked" at 60fps, with no drops.</p>
<p>Moving onto <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, there's a jump from a dynamic 1080p resolution to 4K in docked mode, and performance is now 60fps across the <em>entire</em> game, including the city hub. As for handheld mode, you can expect 1080p with 60fps performance.</p>
<p>The results for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> are also "pretty darn impressive", according to the team at DF. Bowser's Fury, in particular, runs at a dynamic 1800p, with improvements to shadow map resolution, and the frame rate is now "locked" at 60fps in docked. And in handheld there's also a "huge" step up, with the title now 60fps and 1080p.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad</a> goes from 1080p to 1440p on Switch 2 in docked (and 1080p in handheld) and performance remains consistent at 60fps. As for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>, it's now 4K docked and 1080p in portable mode, with 60fps performance "all around".</p>
<p>Overall, though, Digital Foundry thinks every update here is a "really nice upgrade" and Nintendo has done an "awesome job" considering how they've been made available for free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most of the upgrades are pretty significant and in some cases it actually like fixes the game, the two top down Zelda games are the best example of actually solving major technical flaws the original games exhibited, those flaws are gone."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> are also labelled as being perhaps the "most substantial" free upgrades of the lot (you can find out more about this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-review-for-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-on-switch-2">in our previous story</a>). We've mostly highlighted the frame rate and resolutions of these upgrades, but Digital Foundry's video dives much deeper and also discusses HDR support and how it's been applied to these Switch titles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Locomoto (Switch) - On The Right Cosy Track, But Has A Few Train Faults]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/locomoto</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-locomoto-switch-on-the-right-cosy-track-but-has-a-few-train-faults.1230879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/locomoto">Locomoto</a> would be the perfect game for me amidst the Switch 2 chaos. With all the excitement of opening new games and speeding around the track in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, I needed something much slower, calmer, and cosier.</p>
<p>And, for the first five hours, Locomoto slotted into that role perfectly. You're the conductor of your own train which you use to ride across a surprisingly sprawling countryside setting, populated by anthropomorphic characters. It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>-meets-train sim, but with a focus on community building and quests.</p>
<p>You spend most of the game helping residents with their problems, driving them around, and delivering mail. You get paid in tokens which you use to buy materials (which you can also harvest with tools) to craft furniture. Initially, I adored this gameplay loop. I could take my time making my train look pretty and give my passengers the comfiest seats. I enjoyed talking to the characters because each of them had their own personal dramas that often spilled out.</p>
<p>It's all very low stakes, and that works for a 5-10 hour game, but Locomoto is more than double that if you take time to do deliveries and quests. When every train journey is the same rotation, and every task is some variant of a fetch quest, it's no longer relaxing, it's exhausting. Eventually, I just marked my destination on my map and popped my Switch down to let the journey carry on, occasionally checking to see if I needed to fuel up.</p>
<p>The customisation is hugely impressive, and you can create the cutest animal avatar of your dreams. I went for a red panda named Ruby, because c'mon, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/red-panda">look at how irresistible they are</a>. There are tons of clothes to collect throughout the game too, and I was changing outfits basically every hour.</p>
<p>You can decorate your train too, filling it with furniture or painting the outside. It's another great little way of expressing yourself in-game, but it's a little awkward, with stiff-feeling controls as you try to shift furniture across the grid-based decoration system. And if your train is too long, then forget about painting those back carriages.</p>
<p>Lastly, while the game's pastel look is lovely, performance is a little shaky on Switch, even after a day-one patch. Most of the time, it runs at sub-30fps, with weather, busier train journeys, and late-game stations tanking that more. There are also visual bugs too, like suitcases appearing on train tracks, missing textures, characters walking in mid-air, and items spawning inside characters. If you have a Switch 2, play it on there — the game runs at 60fps, and looks better as a result.</p>
<p>Locomoto is clearly a game that puts the 'vibes' first. For a slice of its runtime, it was perfectly pleasant, but by the end, I was running on fumes. Yet, if it's a sedate and steady adventure with solid characters and a cosy atmosphere you're after, you'll love this. Just don't expect a lot of variety.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/locomoto]]></content:encoded>

<p>This comes via a recently-posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMR-2k127U">2nd anniversary video on YouTube</a> in which the developer responded to a comment from our very own community member 'PikaPhantom', simply stating "we will be providing free Switch 2 upgrade soon!".</p>
<p>We're not sure exactly what this might entail, but chances are it'll probably boost the game up to a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>

<p>Dave the Diver has proven to be a massive hit with fans, and its success has led to many collaborations with other indie titles and even a few so-called "AAA" games, too.</p>
<p>In our review, we awarded it a score of 9/10 and said "It's one of the few games to come out this year that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". Definitely one to keep an eye on if you've not played it yet, then.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nrhzsl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>With my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> P Switch journey complete, I'm excited to actually spend some time with the damn machine this weekend. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is still tickling me in a "I can't believe I'm actually playing this" kinda way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> is... well, it's Wind Waker! <em>On the go</em>!</p>
<p>My big plan is to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> over the next couple of days, though. That DK Direct has left me with Power Moons on the mind, and crossing a few more off the seemingly never-ending list is my only course of action. What a game, eh?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still playing quite a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> at the moment, though I must say I’m quite tempted to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> and check out the new additions to the game line-up.</p>
<p>I’ve been a bit manic with my Switch 2 games recently; jumping between a handful of them at frequent intervals out of an abundance of excitement. I’m conscious to just slow down for a little bit and focus on one thing at a time. Probably won’t happen, though.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. That's it. When I start it up, I'm physically unable to pull myself away for about two hours. It's a real problem, but the whole darn thing is just excellent all around. I'm going to hit the 100 hour mark on this loooong before the year is out...</p>
<p>Amazingly, I haven't actually tried out the GameCube NSO app yet, so I think a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> are on the docket for the weekend. But I can't leave my island alone for too long. I've got too many lives to level up.</p>

<div><p>Still making my way around TRON: Catalyst after some unexpected plot twists. But this week’s champion on the Switch eShop is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. Questionable choices of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/front-mission-3-remake-appears-to-replace-2d-art-assets-with-generative-ai">generative AI usage</a> on the game’s fictional internet aside, this is one of the strongest entries in the whole franchise and while being a very “safe” remake, I quite welcome the upgraded PS1 visuals in glorious 16:9 screen ratio.</p><p>

On the Switch 2 front I got a few new bangers but am still too hooked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> and its latest free DLC update while carving my way into chapter 7 of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut. There was also a very nice update on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</a> that brings the new siege PVE game mode that will surely take a chunk of my weekend. Assuming I can safely ignore STEAM summer sales, that’s my weekend sorted.</p></div>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I'm off for holiday the next two weeks, so I'm planning on doing some serious damage to a few things, including my game collection. I'll be playing a whole lot of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a> on PS5, and the amazing <strong>Dune: The Awakening</strong> on PC, those are my main priorities, and if I don't do serious hours in them on my week off it's never happening. However, my beautiful Switch 2 is also gonna be getting plenty of action, fret not</p>
<p>My sons and I will be continuing to hoover up everything in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but I'm also making my way very steadily through the new and improved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, which I rushed through first time out. It's got me wanting to 100% this time, though. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civ 7</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> are all on my holiday hit-list.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and catch you all after a quick two-week power nap. Take care, pals!</p>

<p>This weekend... I'm on a plane! Again! But that means that perhaps it's time to catch up on my backlog. Or... time to do research for my own project! Which means that my options are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, which I'm using as inspiration for a game I'm making to learn programming</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, which I know I'm going to love (as I've mentioned in at least one other WAYP)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, which I bought full price and then only played a couple of hours of</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, which I hear great things about</p>
<p>So many games! So little time. I haven't decided yet, which means I'll probably default to Fantasy Life... again...</p>

<h2>Fraser Gilbert, Pure Xbox Editor</h2>
<p>Hello from the world of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>! I haven't delved into the world of Switch 2 yet, but I'm excited about my latest purchase for the Switch 1 - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>! I managed to pick it up at a great price on Vinted, and as someone who tends to stay away from 2D Mario (but loves <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>), I'm curious to see how I get on it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (kinda addicted to the Koopathlon, not gonna lie), and I'm meaning to get back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a>. I had a great streak going on Ring Fit for weeks, but things got busy around the Xbox Showcase, and I ended up neglecting it. It's time to right that wrong!</p>
