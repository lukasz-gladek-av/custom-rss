<p>But you have to beat it first</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> already looks incredible, but a new trailer from IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 showcases the awesome feature in which you can actually change key moments from the original story.</p>
<p>You need to beat the game once first, during which you'll experience the story from Judgement Day in its entirety, but once you've done that, you're free to mix things up. Doing so will actually open up new levels and opportunities, so for example, instead of sparing the police that show up at Cyberdyne, you can eviscerate them with a mini-gun. Brutal.</p>
<p>There's also a short clip in which the T-1000 impales Sarah Connor, which is obviously quite a departure from how the original movie plays out. We can't wait to what kind of opportunities this might open up for the rest of the story.</p>
<p>As long as it's executed well and it's not, y'know... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a>, then we're all good.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate recently suffered a delay, but is still scheduled to launch this year on <strong>26th November 2025</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 1 was home to plenty of <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> titles, so it was only a matter of time before Switch 2 got in on the fun. Well, that time is finally upon us, and the first series title on the new hardware is... the classic RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>! Wait, that's not <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine II</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, there was a part of us that expected to see the immensely popular 2024 shooter as the one to lead the 40k charge on Switch 2, but it looks like we're going for something different.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a story-rich RPG, where you'll explore the outer space perils of the Koronus Expanse. It boasts all the hallmarks of the genre, with crew-building, tough decisions that have a real effect on the story, and classic isometric turn-based battling. What's more, it seems to do them really rather well.</p>
<p>The game launched on PC, PlayStation and Xbox at the end of 2023 and, while this writer hasn't sampled it himself, it has gone on to rack up almost 15,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">Steam</a>. That's not bad going!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore the Koronus Expanse</strong><br>
Begin your adventure aboard your personal, giant voidship, traveling between the multitude of systems within the Koronus Expanse, a barely charted and incredibly perilous region of space. Despite being considered a backwater of the Imperium, this region encompasses an enormous stretch of the void, filled with dangerous creatures and prodigious opportunities for profit and exploration.<br>
<strong>Gather your Crew<br></strong>Rogue Traders never travel alone. Gather your retinue of righteous heroes, twisted psykers, and perfidious xenos. All of them are ready to follow you into the darkness between the stars. They will offer you counsel, aid you in battle, and allow you to amass ever more power. In return, you can guide them through their own personal journeys, changing their destinies forever.<br>
<strong>Your Decisions Matter<br></strong>During quests show your subjects mercy or disdain, stay faithful to the God-Emperor, or consort with enemies of Mankind - your every decision and every act, even in character creation, is changing the in-game open world and those who inhabit it.<br>
<strong>Plan your Actions Carefully</strong><br>
Slaughter the enemies of Mankind in a fully-fledged isometric turn-based tactical combat. Take advantage of cover, the environment, and careful positioning to overpower your enemies. When that is not enough - use your companion`s powerful abilities to turn the tide of battle and achieve victory even in the direst of situations. Our video game adaption of the classic Rogue Trader ruleset allows an enormous number of possibilities for you to explore.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>OwlCat hasn't provided a specific release date for this one just yet outside of the teasing "coming soon", but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more info.</p>

<p>You better boo-lieve it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're after something spooky to play in the run up to Halloween this year, then you might want to consider <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/an_english_haunting">An English Haunting</a> from developer Postmodern Adventures.</p>
<p>Available via the Switch eShop now, this is a classic point-and-click adventure with retro-inspired visuals and a dark, spooky atmosphere. It kinda reminds us of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective">The Darkside Detective</a>, which was an excellent entry to the genre back in 2017.</p>
<p>You've got touchscreen support with this one in handheld mode, but for those who prefer docked, you can also connect a USB mouse for proper PC-like controls. As for the story, An English Haunting sees you step into the shoes of Professor Patrick More, who "teams up with a deceptive medium to create an extraordinary device that can reveal what lies beyond our world".</p>
<p>In short, it sounds like a delightfully traditional horror story, and we're here for it. Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Point &amp; click adventure gameplay based on inventory puzzles.</p>
<p>- More than 60 detailed pixel art backgrounds to explore.</p>
<p>- A cast of more than 70 characters to interact with, including real figures from the period, such as the medium Florence Cook, physicist William Crookes, illusionist Harry Houdini, and even writer Arthur Conan Doyle, whom you will control to solve one of the game’s mysteries.</p>
<p>- Inspired by the works of the greatest horror authors from the beginning of the 20th century, M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood, and Arthur Machen.</p>
<p>- Text available in English or Spanish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Squirrelled away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Maximum Entertainment popped up at the Fall IGN Fan Fest to reveal that the delightfully weird sandbox shooter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a>, will be blasting onto Switch 2 on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if you didn't catch this one on its PC release last year, the title tells you just about everything you need to know. You play as a squirrel. You have a gun. What you do with it is up to you.</p>
<p>There's a fair emphasis on the 'sandbox' elements here, with platforming, collectibles, weird little challenges and a bunch of funky gun abilities at your disposal. And let's not beat about the bush, the titular conceit paints a funny enough image on its own.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the official <a href="https://squirrelwithagun.com/">Squirrel with a Gun website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fight Tooth, Claw, and Gun</strong><br>
Discover what an erratic squirrel is capable of with a gun in its paws (or just its paws) and how far how far this fuzzy fiend will go to collect its acorns. Escape a secret underground facility and defeat the Agents. Upgrade your weapons and locate the other secret bunkers to take down elite bosses; even blow up a tank! Swap out weapons to try your paw at all 12 types of enemy takedowns.<br>
<strong><br>
Solve Intricate Puzzle Rooms to Collect Golden Acorns</strong><br>
Navigate unique puzzle challenges to collect all the golden acorns by getting creative with how you use your arsenal of weapons, using weapon recoil to give yourself a boost. Collect enough golden acorns to unlock hidden sections of the game.<br>
<strong><br>
Have Some Nutty Sandbox Fun</strong><br>
Explore the world from a squirrel's eye view or cruise around in your toy car. Harass the neighborhood or ask for nice pets from curious passersby. Help them out in exchange for goodies (or simply mug them) and unlock cosmetics to create your squirrely style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who stick around right to the very end of the above Switch 2 announcement trailer will see Maximum Entertainment and Dee Dee Creations showcase a Squirrel with a Gun <em>physical edition</em> too. We don't have any information on when we can expect to see this boxed copy just yet, but it's always exciting news — heck, the mock-up doesn't even have the Game-Key Card icon on it!</p>
