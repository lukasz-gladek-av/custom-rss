<figure><a title="savage raven neogrip review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4aeadfc5a44a8/savage-raven-neogrip-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Skull &amp; Co. released a very nice NeoGrip for the OLED Switch back in 2021, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-skull-and-co-neogrip-for-switch-oled-review">we reviewed at the time</a>, coming away with the impression that, beyond a fiddly holding tab that could potentially get lost, the grips helped make long portable sessions much more comfortable.</p>
<p>With this Switch 2 update, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/Savage%20Raven%20by%20Skull%20&amp;%20Co.%20NeoGrip%20for%20Nintendo%20Switch%202">Savage Raven by Skull &amp; Co. NeoGrip for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which falls under the same 'Savage Raven' banner as the company's excellent Switch 2 carry case (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/savage-raven-edc-switch-2-carry-case-a-sleek-alternative-to-nintendos-official-offering">which we've also reviewed!</a>), not much has really changed.</p>
<p>Once again, you're treated to a well-made, high-quality plastic sheath which the console slides securely into, before being fixed in place with a little tab. Your choice from three sets of grip styles are then clicked into place to complete the deal.</p>
<p>The design here, whilst almost entirely the same as the OLED accessory, has seen a little bit of clever revision with how its fixing tab now clicks into place using a switch that should see it stay secure at all times. You could still lose the little tab, mind, if you take it off then misplace it, however the older design also had the potential to clip off when it hit against things, so at least that issue has been solved this time out.</p>

<p>There are also no separate screws or screw holes for the OG Switch across the back of the plastic brace for this revision either, so it's a cleaner overall product design - albeit one that'll only fit your Switch 2. You can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>As mentioned, this NeoGrip pack comes with the console brace/sheath itself and three different types of grip. The middle-ground grip, which is fitted as default on the accessory, has ended up being the one that I am now using most of the time, as its angular top gives me somewhere to rest my fingers comfortably.</p>
<p>However, both the larger grips and the smallest flat ones are absolutely improvements on the default Joy Con's little grip bumps. I always end up either slipping off those or getting cramp, so I'm happy with the upgrade, thanks.</p>
<p>Indeed, I'm currently mid-review of a game, and for reviews I naturally tend to try to play as much on TV as possible, because I have stupid adult hands that get cramped up and sore in portable mode on Switch, Switch OLED, Switch 2...and a bunch of other handheld consoles. The mid-grips here have my hands feeling fine, with zero pins and needles or cramps detected, and that's after a full-on morning of playing without stops. Result!</p>

<p>As you can see from the pics, the colour used for the grips and brace is also a very, very close match for the console's stylish finish, so you aren't ruining your new tech's vibe at all, and even the bigger grip, with its bulbously rounded tops, looks fairly slim and slick from a side profile. One of my pet hates, no matter how nice an accessory feels, is when it cheapens the look of the console overall by being an off-colour that doesn't quite match, and that's not an issue here. I'd leave it on permanently if it weren't for the fact the Joy Con need to come off so often.</p>
<p>Luckily, it's so easy to take on and off — yes, even for a genuinely ancient moron such as myself — that I can see myself sliding this on every time I'm relaxing on the sofa for some Nintendo time. Which happens about 17 times a day, you understand.</p>

<p>And with regards to the console's dock, with the grips and brace attached, there's no issue for the Switch 2 sliding smoothly in and out, so you can leave it on when playing on the TV.</p>
<p>Overall, then, this one's an easy recommendation if you are looking for a little more purchase on your Switch 2 Joy Con in handheld mode, and an upgrade that's genuinely got my console feeling more like a nice fancy controller when I'm playing on the go.</p>

<p>Knucklotec hands, to be precise</p>

<figure><a title="Goomba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3d7311482435/goomba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">Ask the Developer interview</a> all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is now available for your perusal, and it's packed with anecdotes and info about the upcoming 3D platformer.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting nugget was that the concept of destruction was actually being worked on before development on Bananza officially began. In fact, one concept video shows that the team experimented by sticking hands onto a Goomba – more specifically, Knucklotec hands from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the team said:</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8oqkgip&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>So it wasn’t that the concept of destruction came first, and then you built a mechanic around it?</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Wataru</strong> <strong>Tanaka:</strong> No. Shortly after <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was released, we started running technical experiments with the idea of, “What kind of game do you get if everything in the environment is destructible?”</p>
<p><strong>Kenta</strong> <strong>Motokura:</strong> We even tried sticking arms on a Goomba.</p>
<p><strong>Tanaka:</strong> That's right, we did. (Laughs) In <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, there’s a boss called Knucklotec who attacks Mario with giant hands. The programmer who created him tried attaching those arms to a Goomba as an experiment. The Goomba could smash terrain, tear off pieces to use as weapons, and throw them. Those actions felt surprisingly satisfying, and we got a sense that this destruction-based gameplay could be a compelling core mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>Motokura:</strong> The results of our tests showed that destruction-based gameplay could work, and it was a good match for Donkey Kong’s enormous strength. We felt that the concept and the core gameplay had clicked into place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's a look at the concept video itself (courtesy of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3ltz2wbwelc2h">Stealth40K</a> on BlueSky):</p>

<p>It's a very barebones video, but you can certainly see how it would go on to inform the gameplay seen in Donkey Kong Bananza. It makes us wonder what other kind of concepts Nintendo has managed to stockpile in recent years, too. Just imagine the possibilities!</p>
<p>The same interview also revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-what-donkey-kong-bananza-looked-like-on-switch-1">what Bananza had looked like when it was in development for the Switch 1</a>. The team stated that they had begun to think about moving the game to Switch 2 in 2021 after it became apparent that the improved specs would lead to more satisfying destruction.</p>

<p><em>Okay, so the key question here is: would you like to see a Goomba with Knucklotec hands make an official appearance in a Nintendo game? Let us know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p></section>
