<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157999/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>There were occasions in 2024 where I wanted nothing more than for the frequency of TMNT game releases to slow down a little. We got <em>three</em> new video game outings, and while some opted for big swings, I couldn't help but feel that the sewer-dwellers' saturation was becoming too much — it's funny how a hit like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> and a widely popular movie like <strong>Mutant Mayhem</strong> will do that.</p>
<p>So, it was with some trepidation that I went into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, a turn-based reimagining from developer Strange Scaffold that launched on PC earlier this year promising yet another "new" take on the brothers' beat-'em-up formula. It's a promise that I've been stung by too many times in the past, and I expected nothing but the same again. Dear reader, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Tactical Takedown is a fresh take on what a Turtles game <em>can</em> be. The restraints and rigidity of a turn-based board shouldn't match the fluid motion of a beat 'em up, but somehow, here, they do. It's a bite-sized experience that isn't without flaws, but if you've grown tired of the IP's persistent punching in recent years, this is the reinvigorating pizza slice you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158002/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with that big selling point: yes, it's turn-based. Tactical Takedown takes the Turtles' usual combo-focused combat and translates it into the world of strategy. Each hero has six Action Points per turn, which can be used to move around the arena or take on members of the Foot Clan. With them all spent, it's the Enemy Turn, and you'll see whether your strategic planning paid off, or if your Turtle is going to take a beating.</p>
<p>This format isn't especially new, but it <em>is</em> new for the Turtles. The beat-'em-up trappings are still there (giant 'GO' signs still crop up to guide you through the stages, don't worry), but Strange Scaffold has impressively folded them into the turn-based structure to create something that will feel instantly familiar to Turtles fans, even if you've never touched a strategy RPG before.</p>
<p>Take the brothers' four distinct playstyles, for example. It's a fundamental part of any good Turtles game, and it's well-translated to the turn-based arena. Mikey is all about manoeuvrability, Raph jumps straight into the action and deals heavy hits, Donnie attacks from range and has access to techy traps, and Leo chains together KOs to slice up foes with precision. You can purchase new moves and switch up each Turtle's 'loadout' before each level, but on the whole, Tactical Takedown nails the feel of each character without any tweaking needed.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157994/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, such differentiation has meant there's objectively a 'best' character to play as (and let's admit it, it's Donnie), but the four Turtles feel nicely balanced here, with each level highlighting their pros and cons in isolation.</p>
<p>Wait, "isolation"? Yep. Chalk it up to another method of standing apart from the TMNT big hitters that have come before it, if you want, but Tactical Takedown's four-storyline plot means you'll only ever be controlling one Turtle at a time. I had no issues with this off the bat, where it's handy to play each hero individually to get used to their unique moveset, but the bros are best when they're together, so it would have been nice to see how these different playstyles and strategies could intertwine in later stages.</p>
<p>This is particularly true considering how nice the whole thing feels to play. It took me a couple of stages to get my bearings, but I was soon chaining together combos to get in and out of the action like a true ninja, and I can only imagine how satisfying that would feel if I could set the brothers up to bounce off each other. There's no option for touch controls, which I normally like to see in small-scale strategy like this, but the button inputs are simple enough that I didn't find myself longing to wipe my greasy mitts across the screen.</p>

<p>The brothers' separation aside, this is clearly a team that understands its source material. The story itself feels like a classic cartoon plot (Karai and Baxter Stockman are wreaking havoc in the city after Shredder's death, what a shocker!), and the brothers' distinct personalities shine through in the charming writing — Raph's hothead-to-loving-brother arc is particularly well handled.</p>
<p>Visually, it moves things in an interesting direction, too. Perfectly matching the turn-based tone of the gameplay, Tactical Takedown all looks as if it's a tabletop board game. Sections of the city pop up in isolation as you move through the stage (leaving plenty of room for punting enemies off the side of the map), and each character is represented by a miniature standee, which changes its pose based on its last action. Its simplicity feels right at home on Switch, and while the pared-back personality of the Turtles' look might not suit everyone (I, for one, missed a good idle animation), it's nice to see the heroes in a half-shell reimagined in yet another new style.</p>

<p>It's worth flagging that even if these visuals are completely up your street, you don't get to soak them up for all that long. Tactical Takedown is a bite-sized experience (I finished my initial playthrough in around five hours), and while you <em>can</em> head back into the levels with a new loadout or to beat your high score, it's still the same structure with the same difficulty, which is rather easy.</p>
<p>Remix Mode, a new addition for the Switch release, alleviates this somewhat... but only <em>somewhat</em>. This optional extra lets you replay each level at a higher difficulty with more variety in the enemy types. The difficulty bump is a noticeable one — I died once on my initial playthrough, but I was lucky to get through the opening stages unscathed in Remix — and the new enemies bring their own helping of challenges, but it does still feel like the same old level with the same old Turtle. Which, in fairness, it is.</p>
<p>So, replayability isn't the name of the game in Tactical Takedown, and that's okay. I do wish that the main campaign had lasted for a little longer, but I'd always rather be left wanting more than see a gameplay loop outstay its welcome.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The combination of turn-based strategy and beat-'em-up gameplay felt like a bit of a square peg, round hole situation, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown melds the two to deliver one of the freshest takes on TMNT that I've seen in a long time. It's a short-but-sweet experience that might not gel with <em>everyone</em>, but after 35 years of beat 'em ups and brawlers, this showcases the Turtles like you've never seen them before. And come on, that's pretty radical, dude.</p></section>

<p>"It would be a very good business decision"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tekken 8 Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1ca4b8d5119e/tekken-8-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 release schedule is already home to a bunch of ports that never would have been possible on Switch 1, and we can only assume that this will continue for the years to come. One title that's yet to be eyed for the new hybrid is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a>, but that's not to say that the game's director hasn't thought about it.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2">Eurogamer</a>, director Katsuhiro Harada confessed that Bandai Namco's latest fighter on Switch 2 is "an interesting option, and not totally off the table," but it sounds like it would be far from a simple port. "It would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware," Harada continued.</p>
<p>"From a business standpoint, [Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience," the director mapped out, "but the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision".</p>
<p>It's far from any kind of confirmation (Harada even emphasised that there is "nothing to announce" on this front right now), but it's interesting to hear these pros and cons, nonetheless. As for introducing the game to a bigger audience, that can only be a good thing for Tekken 8 at the moment. It's still under some serious heat after its <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/tekken-8-season-2-patch-notes-are-here-insane-buffs-have-fans-asking-if-its-an-april-fools-joke">Season 2 patch</a> resulted in heavy backlash and even boycotts from the fans, and the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/tekken-8-ps5-fans-miffed-by-latest-content-roadmap">latest content roadmap</a> didn't go down much better.</p>
<p>Maybe all that work for a Switch 2 port would be worthwhile, then? We'll just have to wait and see. The good folk over at our sister site, Push Square, gave Tekken 8 a whopping 9/10 in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/tekken-8">review</a>, calling it "the franchise at its bombastic best", so we sure wouldn't mind getting in on that action too...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ceb4229de9c2/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>'s launch tomorrow, reviews for the wheelchair basketball game have dropped, and... they're <em>pretty</em> mixed. Focusing on 3v3 matches and fully controlled using the Switch 2's Mouse Mode controls, Drag x Drive is a relatively unique multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>But, looking over most reviews of the game, that might be <em>all</em> it is. The game is currently sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">60 Metacritic score</a>. That number will likely change over the coming days as more reviews roll in, but from day one, it looks like this isn't quite a slam dunk.</p>
<p>We had a pretty good time with the game, with the indomitable PJ O'Reilly scoring it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">7/10</a>. Essentially, online multiplayer with friends is a great time, but there's not a <em>ton</em> going on otherwise. Here's a little snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Taking everything into consideration, though, and for the not-enormous price point, there's more depth here than I expected. Drag x Drive feels like a proper attempt to give us something fresh, in the same sort of vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a> back on Switch 1. If you get into its groove, you will get your money's worth."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186124 @ 1755100467 -->
<p>But we're not the only voice out there, so let's see what others have to say about this mouse-controlled game.</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/drag-x-drive-ninendo-switch-2-review/">TheGamer</a>, who also scored the game a 7/10 (well, a 3.5/5), the outlet notes that "It’ll take some time to get used to its oddball pacing and unorthodox mechanics", but that it's a good time overall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Short match times, a small court, and precise team composition make every single round a nail-biter, and that’s mostly when playing with bots during the review period. I cannot wait to see what sort of casual and competitive communities form around this game and what tricks they’re able to pull with its mechanics that someone like me could only dream of."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving down the scale a little, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">IGN</a> awarded the game a 6/10, criticising the game's "drab personality" and aesthetic, but praising the actual gameplay, outside of a lack of variety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I respect the ambition to try something entirely new, even though I recognize the result is definitely not going to be for everyone. But despite its surprisingly good gameplay, Drag x Drive is pretty disappointing in terms of the content outside of its three-on-three online matches, with a lack of variety and enticing unlockables you’d expect from a game like this."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sticking with that lack of variety, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/drag-x-drive-review">Inverse</a> also scored Drag x Drive a 6/10, calling Mouse Mode's implementation "ingenious", but outside of matches, the game is lacking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unfortunately, this rock-solid foundation is underserved by some dull minigames, bland presentation, and a lack of proper single-player modes. While this dearth of content can be excused by the game’s $20 budget price-point, one can’t help but wonder what could have been."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/drag-x-drive-review/">GamesRadar+</a> feels similarly, but scored the game slightly lower at 2.5/5 — shout-out to those "Drag x Drive jeans". The game is fun, but there's "not enough to keep me competing for the long haul", comparing it (unfavourably) to ARMS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But compare Drag x Drive's fairly featureless, almost Toonami-like customizable characters with the sheer sauce on display with designs like Spring Man, Kid Cobra, or the truly iconic Twintelle and it's no contest. It doesn't help that Arms' fighting managed to carefully balance its control scheme with tactical plays that packed a punch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/drag-x-drive">PCMag</a> also settled on a 2.5/5, highlighting that "How much you enjoy Drag x Drive will come down to how much you enjoy this design decision" and that the gameplay can suffer from "tedium":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> understands that motion controls shine when you use them to act out dramatic and exciting moments, like swinging your tennis racket or golf club. Similarly, I loved getting nothing but net when shooting the ball with Drag x Drive's motion controls. But the boring, laborious movement mechanics sully the experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you likely checked out the Global Jam that took place over the weekend, so you likely have a good idea of what to expect when Drag x Drive releases tomorrow. We'll have to see the kind of player base that builds up around the game and its online matches.</p>
