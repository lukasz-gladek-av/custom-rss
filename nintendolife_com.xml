<p>Launching this <strong>Autumn</strong> on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, we honestly weren't expecting to see this one on the Switch 2, but according to Windows Central's Jez Corden, it's actually currently "under consideration" for Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>Corden took to <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2014463781250777444">social media</a> to confirm, stating that it "isn't 100% definite", but if he's to be believed, it seems that Xbox and Playground Studios are at least looking into the viability of a Switch 2 port.</p><div><figure data-videoid="od1TOBPMAIg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytod1TOBPMAIg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed410fbaxrgvjz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"Was told Fable for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't 100% definite for now, but under consideration for the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fable has, until now, never really left the Xbox ecosystem other than a few releases on PC and Mac. These days, however, Microsoft is shifting its strategy to include multiple console releases for its biggest games. It's already released the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pentiment">Pentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> on Switch, and there are ongoing rumours that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> might also makes its way to Switch 2.</p>
<p>We'd love to see this come to fruition though. Fable's blend of fantasy action and British humour is excellent, and although the third mainline entry from 2010 was a bit lacklustre, we can't wait to see what the new game can do.</p>

<p>This will be the second direct for the upcoming Illumination sequel, which is due to arrive in cinemas on 3rd April 2026. Last time, we found out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reveals-rosalina-bowser-jr-and-more">Bowser Jr. and Rosalina</a> would be part of the cast.</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch to the Direct on either YouTube or Nintendo's website, and it kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Mon) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>We've had a couple of clips and teasers since the last Direct, but in a recent interview, the voice Mario (in the movies, at least) Chris Pratt teased that there <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/chris-pratt-supposedly-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">would be more recognisable characters</a> making their appearance in the sequel.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps we'll be seeing them this Sunday? Will Yoshi finally make his long-rumoured appearance?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Let us know if you'll be watching the Direct in the comments.</em></p>
