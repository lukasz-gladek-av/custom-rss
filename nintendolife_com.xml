<p>Here's a teaser...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>There was recently news about the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a></strong> getting a demo on select platforms, and ahead of Halloween, it's now officially available on the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>You'll apparently be able to access the first levels of the game as SpongeBob and Patrick, and also some new abilities (thanks, Nintendo Everything). In general, you'll also be able to get an idea of what to expect before the full release next month on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Above is a trailer of the demo and below we have some PR about the story and adventure SpongeBob and Patrick will go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em><strong>Prepare to be scared – in the most nautical nonsense kind of way!</strong> When the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune’s egos collide, the result is pure undersea chaos: spectral mayhem spreads across Bikini Bottom, and only two brave(ish) heroes can set things right. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up, combine their unique skills, and (hopefully) stop the total ghostification of their world. From the depths of Neptune’s Palace to the icy peaks of Mount Bikini, fans will explore iconic locations, face epic bosses, and first and foremost: have F.U.N!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's been no official mention of a Switch release, so for now, this game remains exclusive to Switch 2 on Nintendo platforms.</p>

<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="bb4dfbf579a54"><a title="Microsoft CEO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb4dfbf579a54/microsoft-ceo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last month, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">reiterated how Xbox would support Switch 2</a> and PlayStation 5 players going forward, and now the tech giant's Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella has chimed in.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142">Speaking to TBPN recently</a> about this "shifting" business model, Nadella mentioned how the company wants to be a "fantastic publisher" on every platform now that the Activision acquisition is complete and it's the "largest publisher" in the business.</p>
<p>He also compared this approach to the one Windows took with Microsoft Office. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now we are the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher - similar approach to what we did with Office, we want to be everywhere in every platform, so we want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the pc, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming, or the TV, so we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this expansion to more devices and platforms, Microsoft is still <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/huge-xbox-report-details-ambitious-next-gen-console-with-free-online-play">reportedly going ahead with its own next-generation</a> gaming plans, which will supposedly blur the lines between PC and Xbox. Nadella also seemingly backed up these reports in his latest interview while claiming Microsoft and gaming's biggest competition was no longer "other" gaming, but "short form video".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming [platforms], gaming's competition is short form video. And so if we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model - [the] best way to innovate is to have good margins because that's the way you can fund."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These comments from Microsoft's CEO follow Xbox's huge announcement last week that it would be bringing <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo</a></strong> to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/halo-confirmed-for-ps5-remake-of-first-game-out-in-2026?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">PlayStation for the first time</a>. On the Nintendo front, the Bethesda games <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a></strong> (IP now under Microsoft's banner) are both on the way to the Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

<p>According to the official patch notes on Nintendo's support page, Version 1.1.4 addresses "several issues" to improve gameplay on the new hybrid hardware. Nintendo doesn't go into the specifics, but if we hear anything, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 1.1.4 (Released October 28, 2025)</h2>
<h6>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h6>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is actually Super Mario 3D All-Stars' third update this year. The previous two versions (1.1.3 and 1.1.2) have the same patch notes as the latest game patch. Again, if we find out what's going on here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Although patches are still being released for this game, keep in mind it's no longer available to purchase on the eShop and was available for a "limited-time" in stores. It contains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> game.</p>

<p>Remember how much time you have sunk into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>? How about all the hours you've put into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a>? What if they were... in the same game?</p>
<p>Yep, you guessed it, Vampire Survivors is crossing over with Balatro in the new 'Ante Chamber' free expansion. This one arrives on most platforms today, but we'll have to wait a little longer until it lands on Switch on <strong>31st October</strong>.</p>
<p>As for what it entails, well, it's just as you might expect. There are four new characters, including Jimbo himself and a few other jester pals, four new weapons and evolutions, a brand new card-filled stage, and a sweet remix of the Balatro theme — because we <em>really</em> needed that stuck in our heads again.</p>
<p>To unlock the crossover, you'll have to track down the merchant in Moonglow and pick up the 'Joker Disk' for 50k gold. After that, the chains of upgrades and unlocks are yours to play through once you enter the new stage.</p>
<p>All of this is part of the massive ver. 1.14 update that Poncle has been teasing us with in recent weeks. The patch includes online co-op, an '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors_ode_to_castlevania">Ode to Castlevania</a>' expansion, the new 'Westwoods' mode and more.</p>
<p>We'll enjoy the free time between now and 31st Oct, because we have a feeling that another time sink might be on the horizon once this drops...</p>

<p>Yep, this looks awesome</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Studios have announced that the vintage noir FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a> will be launching on the Switch 2 on <strong>19th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Utilising the talents of voice actor Troy Baker in the starring role, Mouse showcases stunningly authentic rubber hose animation as you explore a corrupt city full to the brim with armed gangs and crooked cops. Visually, it looks awesome, but we're equally enamoured by the gameplay, too. There are some seriously weird weapons on display!</p>
<p>We're expecting silky-smooth performance on the Switch 2, but as ever, we'll keep you updated on any new information as soon as hear. For now, if you're a fan of old-school animation and FPS games, this definitely seems like one to keep a close eye on.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the list of features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Black and white, hand-drawn rubber hose animation, inspired by cartoons of the 1930s<br>
- Fast-paced FPS combat, where constant movement is key<br>
- A thrilling single-player campaign that unravels a complex web of crime and corruption<br>
- Over 20 noir-infused levels, teeming with mice, rats and shrews<br>
- Fully-loaded arsenal of over a dozen unique weapons and equipment - with a cartoon twist<br>
- Devastating consumable power-ups, capable of turning the tide of any battle<br>
- Unlockable movement abilities and Metroidvania-inspired level traversal<br>
- Original jazz soundtrack, featuring a big band orchestral ensemble</p>
