<p>Get your very own Diancie</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>While today's headline news might be the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC getting a release date, there's another neat announcement tucked in all of the Mega madness.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a brand new Mystery Gift event, which is available in-game now in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Accessing this will unlock a brand new Side Mission in-game — <strong>Shine Bright like a Gemstone</strong> — which will reward you with your very own Diancie and Diancite, a Mega Stone that unlocks a brand new Mega Evolution for the Rock/Fairy-type.</p>
<p>All you need to do to access this gift is roll credits. You don't need to buy the DLC either! Easy, right? And from the looks of things, the event will be live... forever? No end date has been revealed, at least, so you've got time!</p>

<p>Diancie was introduced in Generation VI, first appearing in Pokémon X &amp; Y as part of a special event. It's a Mythical Pokémon, and pretty powerful as a result.</p>

<p>As revealed in today's trailer drop, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>10th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The story DLC sees you and Team MZ investigating mysterious distortions that have been cropping up across Lumiose City, connected to the strange land of 'Hyperspace Lumiose'.</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the new trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just when Team MZ’s efforts seem to have restored peace to Lumiose City, something strange begins to happen—mysterious distortions start forming all around town. You’ll also meet a mysterious young girl named Ansha, who is accompanied by the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We can expect new Mega Evolutions (Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y take pride of place on the key art), plenty of Hoopa content, and more than a little eerily-silent dialogue from you and your MZ pals. Hey, at least the dimension-hopping looks interesting enough.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some of those new Mega forms for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, Diancie and Meganium:</p>

<p>As a reminder, the DLC will set you back <strong>£24.99 / $29.99</strong>, and it is now available to buy on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html#DLC">Switch eShop</a>.</p>

<p>I need hands!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well here's a dish that we weren't expecting! Team17 and Ghost Town Games have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overcooked-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Overcooked 2! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is being served up today!</p>
<p>As initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, this is the same old co-op cooking chaos that we all know and love, garnished with some new features to make the most of the beefed-up system.</p>
<p>We've got 4k 60fps gameplay in docked mode, we've got camera integration so everyone's screaming faces can appear on screen, we've got GameShare for playing with pals on one copy of the game, heck, there's even a new chef: The Pristine Platinum Platypus.</p>
<p>A pretty balanced meal, no? Well, it won't arrive for free. Those with the Switch 1 version of the game will be able to upgrade for <strong>£7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99</strong>, or you can pick up the full Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> on the eShop. There is a 20% discount running on the storefront for one week only, so you can sneak in and grab an early bird offer if you want to plate up soon.</p>

<p>And for all those wondering, yes, there is cross-progression for this release, so all of your precious DLC and save data can be transferred over to the new edition without any troubles — nobody wants to see those three-star runs go to waste.</p>
<p>A spot of Overcooked can be a dangerous game over the holiday season, but with the right chefs in the kitchen, we're ready to head back in for another good old giggle.</p>

<p>NieR, far, wherever you are</p>

<figure data-uuid="d8ce9b420bc9d"><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d8ce9b420bc9d/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> finally comes swinging onto Switch 2 today, and as anyone who has already picked up the game will be able to tell you, the soundtrack <em>slaps</em>.</p>
<p>As today is launch day, we now know who to thank for such musical bangers, and it's none other than the music group Monaca — the sound team behind the <strong>NieR</strong> series.</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment popped up on the <a href="https://monaca.jp/en/works/13333">Monaca website</a> today, crediting Keiichi Okabe, Kuniyuki Takahashi, Oliver Good, Keita Inoue, Taichi Joraku for the composition, and Ryuichi Takada for the arrangement.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2srloij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The production studio was founded by Okabe back in 2004, and has since provided tunes for games and anime alike, even picking up the coveted 'Best Score/Music' award at the Game Awards 2017 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a>.</p>
<p>The team has long served on the NieR series, though you'll also find their works in PS5 titles like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/foamstars">Foamstars</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>, and they even assisted on a handful of songs in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> soundtrack.</p>
<p>This is the first time they've had a Nintendo joint to themselves, mind you, and we are big fans of it. We described the score as "excellent" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">our review</a>, and have been leaping back to the music player on more than one occasion to listen to select tracks in isolation.</p>
