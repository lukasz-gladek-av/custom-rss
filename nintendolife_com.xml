<p>Are you excited? Because we are excited! Yes, it's getting mighty close to the return of everyone's favourite video game ape, and to celebrate Nintendo has posted a little movie on its social media (and to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> app, naturally) to remind us all that there are precisely <em>three days to go</em> until the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Nice! We hope DK gets over that rather crushing blow in time for our adventures later this week, though.</p>
<p>Of course, for a game that hadn't really got us particularly excited in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 itself, Bananza has rapidly become one of our most-anticipated games of the year over the past month or so.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8jptxoh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game's excellent Direct did lots to whet our appetites, revealing the clever layered world and smashing traversal styles at the heart of it all, and finding out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">the Super Mario Odyssey team are behind this one</a> has now got us 100% on board.</p>
<p>It seems that physical copies of the game have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">found their way into gamers' hands already</a>, but the rest of us don't have too long to wait until the Thursday launch. How many days was it again? Make sure to check out our preview of the game, too, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">which is sounding mighty positive thus far</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the DK sphere, the game's director has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-director-acknowledges-performance-drops-we-prioritized-fun-and-playability">acknowledged some performance dips</a>, and a copyright filing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-might-be-getting-his-own-movie">suggests</a> the ape may be getting his very own movie.<em><br></em></p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Cow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e7d7935d5da7/mario-kart-world-cow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time for another look at the weekly UK charts, and what do you know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is still holding onto pole position.</p>
<p>Yes, the Switch 2's flagship title has landed the gold medal once again, but it wasn't without competition. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> made a gnarly arrival, kickflipping into second in its debut week (with only 11% and 10% of sales coming from Switch 2 and Switch 1, mind you) and the likes of <strong>The Sims 4: Enchanted by Nature</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/legacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_1_and_2_remastered">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</a> also put up good enough numbers in the first week to disturb the waters of the chart's upper ranking.</p>
<p>Everything else is a pretty familiar sight, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> all hanging about in the top 10. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has taken a bit of a tumble this week and now finds itself in tenth, while <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has made an almighty leap from 25th to fifth.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon TCG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b3b9accbe2652/pokemon-tcg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've had stories previously in which shops specialising in trading cards have found themselves the unfortunate victims of robberies, but this one really takes the cake.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-card-shop-robbed-of-valuable-cards-by-other-pokemon-card-shop-a-few-blocks-away/">Automaton</a>, a 35-year-old Japanese man was arrested on suspicion of robbery on 9th July 2025 and is alleged to have stolen 123 items at knifepoint worth approximately $94,000 from a Pokémon Trading Card store. The twist? The accused is apparently the owner of his own Pokémon and One Piece-focused trading card shop within the same neighbourhood.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvtronx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Although the police didn't disclose such information, the owner of the target store posted a message on <a href="https://x.com/MASTERS_gifu/status/1943158484863693250">X</a> to confirm that the accused is the manager of a competing store. The post concludes by stating that anybody else involved in the crime should "surrender immediately", asking those who might have information to come forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the robbery incident that occurred at our store on 6/14,<br>
following Sakaguchi and Ando, the manager of the neighboring store Treca Junky @toreca_junky, Yuji Watanabe, has also been arrested as an accomplice in the robbery.</p>
<p>Those still involved should surrender immediately.<br>
Thinking you won’t get caught is impossible.</p>
<p>We will absolutely catch everyone.</p>
<p>We welcome any information, no matter how small.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post has since attracted quite a bit of attention, though it remains unclear whether there have been any further developments at this stage.</p>
<p>It's good that at least <em>some</em> progress is being made to get the whole thing sorted, mind. It's likely pretty difficult to deduct who might be perpetrating such crimes at the best of times, but when the stolen goods are then sold on immediately in a rival store..? Gosh, that must be rough.</p>
