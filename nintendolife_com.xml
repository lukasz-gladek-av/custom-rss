<p>Drop into... Springfield!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Epic's free-to-play battle royale <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has hosted all sorts of exciting collabs over the years, but this latest one, focused on the long-running cartoon series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/simpsons_hit_and_run">The Simpsons</a>, arguably goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>Players will be dropping into an 80-player cel-shaded Springfield Island, featuring a "back-to-basics" style Battle Royale experience. Each week will bring new Simpsons-themed gameplay, shop offerings and much more.</p>
<p>Alongside this will be new "mini episodes", which preview each week's gameplay narrative and map updates. These are original animated shorts, co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic, and released on Disney+ globally and Fortnite's social channels. You can watch the first one below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st November</strong> - <em>“Apocalypse D’Oh"</em></li>
<li><strong>10th November</strong> - <em>“Sugar High”</em></li>
<li><strong>17th November</strong> - <em>“Multiplidiocy”</em></li>
<li><strong>24th November</strong> - <em>“The Incredible Bulk”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to look the part, there'll also be a Springfield Battle Pass, which comes loaded with Outfits as premium rewards including Homer, Marge, Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and a Springfielder version of the Fortnite character Peely. This Battle Pass also has Fortnite's first Sidekick Peels, with <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks">more coming to the Shop</a> next week.</p>
<p>This event follows the release of Fortnite on the Switch 2 in June. You can get the rundown about this version of the game and how it performs in our review here on Nintendo Life:</p>

<figure data-uuid="f8697cacf056a"><a title="Karen McKenna SMRPG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8697cacf056a/karen-mckenna-smrpg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Karen McKenna</em></figcaption></figure><p>It began with a Zelda T-shirt.</p>
<p>I was wearing my <em>“It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.”</em> shirt while running a quick errand at the bank. The teller spotted it. He was at least 20 years younger than me, but his “Nice shirt!” comment kicked off a lengthy conversation about our shared Nintendo fandom.</p>
<p>Before long, he pulled out a tablet and showed me <a href="https://grantgm.com/">his digital fan art</a>. It was awesome: detailed, dynamic sketches of Mario, Pokémon, and (my favourite) Metroid characters. His passion was apparent.</p>
<p>I told him I was thrilled by his drawings, because I know how much that work means. You see, years ago, I had a job at Nintendo that involved seeing hundreds of pieces of original Nintendo fan art. And I took some home.</p>
<p>This is the story of that collection, and how a handful of drawings, once marked for the landfill, became some of the most meaningful pieces of my gaming collection.</p>

<h2><strong>Player’s Pulse and a Pile of Precious Paper</strong></h2>
<p>This will definitely date me, but I interned at Nintendo during the second half of 1996. Before long, I was given complete control of Player’s Pulse, the letters to the editor section. I chose fan letters, wrote responses, and, most importantly, picked the envelope art that was displayed on those pages.</p>
<p>Mind you, this was nearly three decades ago, so the letters and the artwork were on real, physical paper, sent via snail mail. This was before the days of email and file shares.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved sifting through the envelope art because it was pure fandom: earnest, expressive, and often beautiful.</p>
<p>I was shocked to learn that it was Nintendo's practice to destroy all artwork after it had been screened and scanned for the magazine! That meant dozens, maybe hundreds, of amateur art pieces in the trash bin each month.</p>
<p>It felt criminal to toss that effort, so I kept all the artwork that came across my desk during my short internship.</p>
<p>Here are five pieces of art that define the long journey of that collection:</p>
<h2><strong>Naomi Chiba’s Envelopes</strong></h2>
<p>Years after I left Nintendo Power, I read a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-power-helped-a-shy-fan-show-her-art-to-the-wor-1786871046">Kotaku article</a> about <strong>Naomi Chiba</strong>, easily the most prolific Player’s Pulse artist ever. While reading, I remembered that I had three of her original envelopes in my collection!</p>
<figure data-uuid="097d8e4038545"><a title="Two published and one unpublished art piece by Naomi Chiba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/097d8e4038545/two-published-and-one-unpublished-art-piece-by-naomi-chiba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Naomi Chiba</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With help from the author, I connected with Naomi and arranged to return her artwork.</p>
<p>Doing so was surprisingly emotional. I hesitated when it came time to seal the envelope, but then it occurred to me that she might be the first person to ever get back the artwork that they had sent to Nintendo Power.</p>
<p>That’s when it hit me: this coloured paper meant something.</p>
<h2><strong>Quid pro Quo with Seth</strong></h2>
<p>The success with Naomi led me to find more artists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hatlandous/">Seth Hatland</a> came next. He was so grateful to get his <strong>Mega Man X</strong> and <strong>Mario</strong> drawings back that he insisted on trading them for a brand-new piece of art as a thank you. “I’ve gotten slightly better,” he said.</p>
<p>What an understatement!</p>
<p>He sent me an incredible piece of Link that has hung proudly in my office ever since.</p>

<h2><strong>The Big Trade</strong></h2>
<p>After returning art to several more creators, I was connected with Stephan Reese (aka <a href="https://x.com/ArtofNP">ArtofNP</a>) and his non-profit <a href="https://www.interactiveartcollection.org/">Interactive Art Collection</a>. They specialise in original Nintendo Power artwork, although he hadn’t seen much in the way of envelope art - probably because Nintendo had destroyed it all.</p>
<p>I ultimately agreed to add most of my remaining collection to his museum.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2682f716b2d85"><a title="Envelope art from Nintendo Power" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2682f716b2d85/envelope-art-from-nintendo-power.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In return, Stephan sent me an original, professional piece made for the promotional brochure of the Nintendo Super System arcade, circa 1992. I love it almost as much as the amateur stuff, plus I’m happy to know that the rest of the fan art is in a better place than a binder on my shelf.</p>
<figure data-uuid="00245d417ff8f"><a title="Original art for the Nintendo Super System arcade brochure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00245d417ff8f/original-art-for-the-nintendo-super-system-arcade-brochure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>(I'm the "ex-Nintendo employee" mentioned in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-art-of-nintendo-power-exhibit-a-guided-tour">Nintendo Life post</a> about Stephan’s exhibit a couple of years ago.)</p>

<h2><strong>The One I Kept</strong></h2>
<p>After all that wheeling and dealing, I was left with one volume's worth of envelopes, which hangs in my game room. Here’s Volume 92 in all its glory:</p>
<figure data-uuid="c6f322714c9cb"><a title="Framed fan-art from Nintendo Power Volume 92" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6f322714c9cb/framed-fan-art-from-nintendo-power-volume-92.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Family Fan Art</strong></h2>
<p>The most recent additions to my art collection are courtesy of my own kids. Is there anything better than a child’s imagination and fandom put to paper?</p>
<p>My oldest is studying art at Utah State University, but her early work continues to remind me that fan art isn't just a fun hobby; sometimes it’s a training ground.</p>

<hr>
<p>When I look at my art collection, I don’t see discarded mail. I see a bond between the creatives at a massive entertainment company and their fans.</p>
<p>My new bank teller friend, with his portfolio of beautiful, detailed digital sketches, is part of a timeless, vital tradition. He's doing what fans, including my own daughter, have done for decades: translating their hobby into a personal act of creation.</p>
<p>I may have initially 'stolen' art from Nintendo, but in the end, that art taught me a lesson: the true heart of a gaming community isn't some corporate office. It's the enduring, incredible passion of its talented fans.</p>
