<figure><a title="Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1db8811c4c1ba/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>Marvelous has recently released <a href="https://marvelousgames.com/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-1-0-5-update">a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> on both the Switch and Switch 2, bringing the game up to version 1.0.5.</p>
<p>It's not a <em>massive</em> one, but there are definitely a few tweaks here that should improve your experience with the game considerably. Heck, we love Woolby, but reducing how often the dude pipes up is a big win in our books.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's check out the patch notes:</p>
<h6>Features</h6>
<ul>
<li>Adds the ability to adjust village farmer behavior in the Options menu. You can now toggle the following tasks on or off: sow seeds, water fields, and harvest crops.</li>
</ul><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lnjwix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h6>Bug Fixes</h6>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes.</li>
<li>Adjusted the volume of certain lines for Zaza and Woolby in Japanese.</li>
<li>The Sacred Sword can now harvest crops over a wider range.</li>
<li>Added new warp points for Spring Village’s and Autumn Village’s development zones.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where players could not obtain the Evasive Leg Guards. You can now purchase them at blacksmiths once your village level is high enough.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the ema plaque request “The Divine Sword Dance is the Best!” would not be available.</li>
<li>Adjusted the Blade Shard drop rate so you can now obtain them from high-level toad and fallen warrior enemies.</li>
<li>Fixed bugs that halted progression during certain Bonding Quests.</li>
<li>Adjusted the frequency of certain “Woolby” voice lines.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where player names could not include character names from the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which certain Bonding Quests and main story quests could not progress.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which some Ema Board and Hometown Quests could not be completed.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes including some localisation adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We reckon Guardians of Azuma is well worth checking out if you haven't done so already. We awarded the game a 9/10 on the Switch and Switch 2, stating that it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced it will be running another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-switch-online-playtest-program-returning-includes-switch-2-support">Switch Online Playtest Program later this month</a>, and in the fine print of the application guidelines and "how to apply" section, it once again asks participants to "not discuss or disclose content" about this test.</p>
<p>This request from Nintendo to not share content also extends to not revealing details from the participant website or talking about the experience with "others". One exception to this rule is if you participate "as a group" in the playtest, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it's "within the bounds of your group".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lnjwix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others. If you participate as a group, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it remains within the bounds of your group."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you might recall, the previous playtest immediately led to all sorts of leaks – with participants uploading details and videos about the experience, and also live streaming direct footage. According to previous reports, Nintendo responded to this at the time with copyright takedowns across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Although Nintendo was enforcing these rules in the previous test, oddly, it didn't even bother to disable in-game screenshots or the video recording feature on the Switch. This latest playtest is also bumping the participant count from 10,000 users to "as many as 40,000 participants worldwide" so the chance of a leak has just been drastically increased.</p>

According to the credits (via IGN), Kouji Takeda is Donkey Kong, and Pauline is voiced by Jenny Kidd.</p>
<p>Takeda is the voice of DK in the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie and was also listed in the credits of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. This follows reports of Takashi Nagasako (the voice of DK for over two decades) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/princess-peachs-voice-actor-has-been-replaced-after-18-years"><em>not</em> being credited</a> in last month's Switch 2 launch title.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vhpily&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As for Kidd, this actor and musician takes on the role of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/paulines-age-in-donkey-kong-bananza-has-been-revealed">younger 13-year-old version of Pauline</a>. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> version of this character is voiced by Kate Higgins – with the same voice talent also cast as her in the more recent release, Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In some related news, last month it was confirmed Peach's voice actor had been replaced after an 18 year run. In recent years, Nintendo has also told fans to wait for the official game release to find out details like this. This has extended to developer reveals, although this was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">slightly different for DK's new outing</a>.</p>

We saw it with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> physical release, and DK's new release also has artwork on this side of the case.</p>
<p>It's an image of Donkey Kong and Pauline taking a break from their new adventure. You might have seen this artwork in some other promotional materials before now. Although there's no Switch 2 branding, you can still swap it to the front side of the case. Here's a look, courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/Jake_Randall_YT">YouTuber Jake Randall</a> on social media:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vhpily&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, if you haven't already got a physical version of Donkey Kong Bananza, or just don't plan on getting a hard copy of the game, this is what it looks like when you open the case! Nintendo also did <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/heres_a_first_look_inside_metroid_dreads_nintendo_switch_game_case">similar full spread shots like this</a> on some box arts during the Switch generation.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the DK physical release, the game card (which includes the <em>entire</em> game on the card) features the same artwork as Banaza's front cover featuring DK and Pauline. And the <a href="https://x.com/BoTalksGames/status/1943776059562070078">back of the case</a> shows off some more artwork of DK, while also highlighting some other aspects of the game.</p>
<p>All of this has got us wondering if our community has picked up this new Switch 2 release physically or if they purchased the game digitally via the eShop? <em>So, vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>This test will be available to users located in the US, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Japan, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It will take place between <strong>28th July 2025</strong> until <strong>10th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Registrations open this week on <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>, and if you participated in the previous playtest, you can apply to participate individually or as a group for this latest test. Applicants will be accepted on a "first-come, first-served basis".</p>
<p>In the lead up to the original playtest last year, Nintendo told participants to not "discuss or disclose" anything about it. Of course, this led to details and footage of the game leaking online, with some users even streaming their experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-still-doesnt-want-you-to-talk-about-the-switch-online-playtest-program">same rules apply for the latest test</a>, and Nintendo also notes how this playtest is "expected to accept as many as 40,000 participants worldwide". This announcement follows the news earlier this week Nintendo would be hosting an online demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, due out next month.</p>
