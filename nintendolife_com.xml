<p>The Switch 2 Edition includes 4K and 120fps modes</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Inti Creates is kicking off the new year with the announcement of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gunvolt-chronicles-luminous-avenger-ix-1plus2-dual-collection">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 1+2 Dual Collection</a></strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>This "director's cut" will arrive on <strong>9th July 2026</strong> and comes loaded with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix_2">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 2</a>. On top of this, it will include all of the DLC!</p>
<p>There will also be some new content in the 2D action games, including "Endless Battle" mode, where you'll take on a never-ending challenge and face off against an "onslaught" of random bosses. Inti Creates is even going to the extent of making some balance updates to upgrade the gameplay, making it sharper and more accessible than before.</p>
<p>Perhaps, most notably, the Switch 2 Edition of the game will be able to swap between a "high resolution (4K) display mode" and "high performance (120fps) mode". So you can expect a silky smooth and super sharp experience.</p>
<p>Physical releases have also been confirmed in Japan (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/gunvolt-chronicles-luminous-avenger-ix-12-dual-collection-announced-for-ps5-switch-2-switch-and-pc">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>). There'll be a standard edition and a limited edition featuring an official art book and a four-disc complete soundtrack. If we hear any significant updates about the physical releases, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>You guessed it...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last month, Bandai Namco announced a new Dragon Ball project titled "<strong>Age 1000</strong>" which is currently set to arrive in 2027.</p>
<p>Fans already had multiple theories about what this new project might actually be, and in an update, it seems it's arguably the most obvious one! Bandai Namco's official Southeast Asia YouTube channel recently added the Age 1000 trailer to a new playlist titled... "<strong>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 3</strong>".</p>
<p>It was spotted by many Dragon Ball fans before the same Bandai Namco YouTube account removed it. As highlighted on social media, it's even got the same artwork revealed alongside "Age 1000".</p>

<p>Of course, Bandai Namco hasn't confirmed Age 1000 is Xenoverse 3 just yet and the official game title was intended to be revealed at a later date, so it's probably best to treat this as a rumour for now until it's officially announced.</p>
<p>According to last month's announcement, this is a "brand-new" Dragon Ball world featuring "never-before seen" characters by series creator Akira Toriyama, who passed away in 2024. It's been in development for "about 6 to 7 years now including the initial concept phase" and more details will be shared at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>
<p>Although no platforms have been announced for this new title, Bandai Namco previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_xenoverse_2">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> on the Switch.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved communication stability during online play.</li>
<li>There was a problem in the Checklist where the number of events, machines, riders, etc. would not be counted correctly in applicable tasks. This has been fixed so that even if the issue has already occurred, players can restore counts to the correct number by restarting the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where rewards for completing all the tasks for Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial, and Road Trip could not be obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where the task “Hit 2 riders with Kaboombs in a single race” would not be considered accomplished in an online match, even if conditions were met.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where multiples of the same legendary-machine parts would sometimes appear during online matches in City Trial.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Cyberion Highway where riders would sometimes go off course after getting off the grind rails and be unable to return to the course.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, by performing a Quick Spin on a grind rail just before a specific rider’s Special would end, the Special would not end.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Crystalline Fissure where riders could go at abnormally fast speeds when jumping out of the ground of the half-pipe using the Drill Copy Ability.</li>
<li>There was a problem with Taranza where spider silk could be produced even when in a frozen state from something like a rival’s Freeze Copy Ability, so the frozen state could be quickly lifted. This issue has been fixed so that Taranza cannot produce silk when frozen.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where headwear was not reflected when riders were randomized in Local Play.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player-controlled Scarfy was near when a Transform Star placed in a garage transforms, Scarfy could end up entering angry state.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Checker Knights where the appearance effects of the jump ramps that appear and disappear were sometimes out of alignment with their actual position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Transform Star where it would sometimes not accelerate if a Boost Dash was performed when a mode switch finished.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain Copy Abilities wouldn’t work properly after Scarfy’s angry state ended while the Copy Abilities were activated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the thumbnails for My Machines would, in rare instances, be incorrect.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in City Trial where items would sometimes not appear when destroying crystals in the underground area with Knuckle Joe’s automatic attack.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Free Run where, after recording a Personal Best with Transform Star (star mode or bike mode), the Best Run data could not be loaded when trying to start a race in a different mode from the one in which the Personal Best was recorded in.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where online-events records could sometimes be used as a reference value for the “High Score” search condition in Spectate.
<ul>
<li>Since records that could not be produced in normal play were sometimes used as a reference value, all reference values for “High Score” have been initialized in this latest update.</li>
<li>“High Score” search results will temporarily not be displayed until players race with and on the corresponding machines/courses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would stop progressing if the course was randomized during a Top Ride Series in a paddock.</li>
<li>Made several other miscellaneous gameplay fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>A tiny patch addressing "several issues"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has already released an update for the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> this year, and it has now rolled out another one. So, if you like staying on top of your game updates, consider this a PSA and get downloading!</p>
<p>This new update follows on from Version 3.1.0 (which added Polish as a supported language) and bumps the latest build of the game up to <strong>Version 3.2.0</strong>. According to Nintendo's official patch notes, this patch addresses "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience".</p>
<p>If we find out what exactly has been adjusted behind the scenes after this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know. Based on the information provided, it's just ironing out some issues.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Donkey Kong Bananza was followed by the paid DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> in September last year. This DLC includes special in-game events, where you unlock statues to display on DK Island, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/donkey-kong-bananzas-next-dlc-in-game-event-starts-today">latest event has just wrapped</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a demo for Donkey Kong Bananza available on the eShop, so if you haven't already tried it out, this is a great way to jump in. In some other Switch 2 update news, Nintendo has released a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> this week.</p>

<p>80 minutes of Mario Wonder and Pokopia</p>

<figure data-uuid="aa3bbdbac513f"><a title="Nintendo Treehouse February 2026" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aa3bbdbac513f/nintendo-treehouse-february-2026.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>You might think that we've already seen all there is to see about upcoming Switch 2 titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, but you'd be mistaken. Here to show even more in the gameplay department for both games is a brand new Nintendo Treehouse presentation.</p>
<p>The Treehouse is set to kick off shortly, promising 80 minutes of gameplay between the two titles. Remember, both Mario Wonder and Pokopia have already received overview trailers of their own, so we expect today's presentation to be more about the <em>vibe</em> of playing, hopefully giving us an even closer look at what's in store.</p>
<p>Here's the exact time that the presentation will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 2pm PST / 3pm MST / 4pm CST / 5pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 10pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 11pm CET / 12am (Wed) EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 7am (Wed) JST / 6am (Wed) AWST / 9am (Wed) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>The full Treehouse event is being livestreamed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8SyOGO_ubSo">YouTube</a>, but if you want to chat along with your fellow Nintendo Lifers while you watch, then we've got you covered with the stream below.</p>
<p>So, grab 80 minutes' worth of snacks and drinks, and let's get ready for some gameplay!</p>
