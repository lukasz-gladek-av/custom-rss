<p>There has been a fair bit of news in the world of Nintendo this week. The Game Awards came and went, bringing a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">fair few announcements</a> and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">couple of prizes for the Big N</a>. Nintendo expanded both its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-n64-library-with-two-classic-platformers">Nintendo 64</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-expands-switch-2-gamecube-library-with-warios-3d-outing">GameCube</a> NSO libraries, and let us see our most-played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> tunes in the app's '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-musics-2025-year-in-review-is-now-available-see-your-most-played-songs">Year in Review</a>'. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-skyrim-anniversary-edition-lands-on-switch-2-today">landed on Switch 2</a> as <em>another</em> re-release — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/video-skyrim-still-isnt-60fps-on-switch-2-but-heres-how-it-fares-against-switch-1">still at 30fps</a> — and the Switch and Switch 2 were graced with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-1-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">new system update</a>.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Oh gosh, there is so much that I want to play and so little time to play it! Despite having a good time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> so far, I'm still only a couple of hours into it. I'm hoping to remedy that this weekend, but I'd also like to check out the Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC, and finally wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, which leaves time for... not much else.</p>
<p>Hey ho, back to the sofa we go!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>As is customary in the race to catch up with the year's games, I've distracted myself with something from eons ago that has zero relevance to 2025 GOTY discussions. The kids saw the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy REROLL</a> icon on my Switch menu, and that was that. Helluva game, and its compulsive mix of simple goals, absurdity, and awesome audio has been a salve in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm still playing the brilliant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simogo_legacy_collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (which managed to haul me from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a>) and I'm enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Okay, so how much did Leon’s gameplay in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> look like a cross between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">6</a>?! Wild. So of course that means I’m playing more RE this weekend. Specifically… yes, 4 and 6. Leon’s back baby, and I couldn’t be more thrilled.</p>
<p>I do, however, think it’s about time I actually play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> properly. It’s been sitting on my home screen since launch and I’ve played the tutorial battle about 10 times before something else comes along and distracts me. Maybe I need to stop playing so much Resident Evil…<br>
Nah.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>By the time you’re reading this, I will have completed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and that is my GOTY 2025. I will be feeling a great emptiness in my life, that joy of experiencing a great work for the first time forever gone, the eagerness to see what comes next, find a new upgrade, fight a new boss and conclude Samus' and her fellow stranded Federation soldiers' ordeal (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a> sequel when?). More time to wrap up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>'s proper ending and return to the streets of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>.</p>
<p>My game of the week is the much-delayed, much sublime Terminator 2D: No Fate. Bitmap Bureau took on a tall order by grabbing a franchise that is held dear in the hearts of gamers of my generation, but seems to have pulled it off. While <strong>Terminator 2</strong> is one of the finest movie sequels ever produced, it never got a 2D platform run’n’gun game it deserved until yesterday. Maybe the future is gonna be OK after all.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, my mother-in-law has come to stay! What kind of games do mothers of the in-law variety enjoy? Well, I know she likes Mr Bean, because we watched two hours of <strong>Mr Bean</strong> last night. Is there a Mr Bean game? I don't think I want to play it.</p>
<p>I'm still making my way through <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and I just discovered the radio, which is now my favourite thing about the game. And it never tells you about it! Imagine playing <strong>Fallout</strong> without the radio. It would be a very different game. TOW2 has a similar musical vibe, with lots of jazz and swing, except it turns out that it was all commissioned for the game from real jazz and swing bands, with lyrics that reference in-game brands. Yes! All the music is advertising jingles! And it RULES. The lyrics are very funny, especially when you're only half listening as you wander through space and you suddenly catch a line like "Come get your candyyyy (it's tobacco) delicious candyyyy (that's tobacco".</p>
<p>Since it's getting close to Christmas, me and my partner are also considering what our Christmas Time game will be! Right now, he's replaying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> (it's just as good as you remember it being!) but I've also got him the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Collection</a> on Switch, because he expressed interest in wanting to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>. He probably won't read this, so I'm pretty sure it's fine to say that here. But don't tell him, okay?</p>

It turns out this might be one of the final significant patches.</p>
<p>According to a roughly translated post on social media, the game's director Masahiro Sakurai said the Kirby Air Riders development team will be disbanding in the near future. As a result, there's only a short amount of time left to make balance adjustments.</p>
<p>He goes on to say how there may be one more round of adjustments, but after this, work on the racer is likely done.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adwxsyqu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Sakurai previously mentioned in October how there were no plans for DLC (or similar content) in Kirby Air Riders, stating "everything" was already in the game from the start.</p>

<p>See what it's all about</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom yesterday announced its new sci-fi action adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, starring Hugh and his android companion Diana, would be coming to the Switch 2 in April 2026.</p>
<p>As you might have already heard, this title (where you explore a lunar research station) adds a "unique hacking twist" to gameplay - combining basically puzzle solving, fire fights and more, as you take down robot enemies. To help illustrate what's going on, Capcom has now uploaded a new "hands-on" impressions video, featuring some of its "friends" who explain their own experiences with this new game.</p>
<p>Once again, the demo for Pragmata is available to try out now on Steam, and will be "coming later" to the Switch 2 and other console platforms. Here's a bit about what you can expect when it does arrive on Nintendo's hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay demo, known as Sketchbook, lets you try out the tactile combat system that fully engages both sides of your brain, while you also get to experience what it's like to traverse the lunar research station."</p>
<p>"You might discover new things as you replay the demo! Complete the demo to receive an illustration from Diana and don't forget to share it with #PRAGMATA on your socials."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pre-orders have also gone live in select locations. This title will set you back <strong>$59.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), and there's an amiibo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-capcom-is-bringing-pragmata-to-switch-2-amiibo-and-demo-also-confirmed">Diana on the way</a>. Capcom will also be offering some DLC known as the 'Shelter Variety Pack'. This includes the following items:</p>
