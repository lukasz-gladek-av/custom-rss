<p>The 'Freeze Break' event kicked off today (<strong>20th Jan</strong>) and will be sticking around until <strong>27th Jan at 7:59am GMT / 8:59am CET / 11:59 PT (26th)</strong> — so there's plenty of time to get in and grab the rewards.</p>
<p>Much like previous events, this one sees another pair of familiar faces from the DK series get the statue treatment. It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Tropical Freeze</a> in the limelight this time, with Tucks and Lord Fredrik statues available to all those who meet the event quota.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4jplowt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As we've seen previously, 'Freeze Break' will challenge you to complete the Emerald Rush roguelike mode only using a limited number of perks and upgrades. This one takes place entirely on the Freezer Layer, fittingly, so prepare to mix up your approach with whatever boosts are available.</p>

<p>As easy as A, B, Sea</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sail_forth">Sail Forth</a> floated onto Switch back in 2022 with its adorable seafaring adventures reminding us of a beautiful blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. A little over three years on, developer Festive Vector and publisher The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild have launched a new version to make the most of the Switch 2's fancy features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sail-forth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sail Forth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, as it is creatively called, is now available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Sail-Forth-1695260.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>$19.99</strong> <em>or</em> as a free upgrade pack to all those who already own the game.</p>
<p>There's no new content, per se (bar the last three years of updates and DLC), but it certainly sounds like a much better experience from a technical standpoint. The new edition boasts 1080p resolution in handheld, 4K in docked, faster load times and a boosted frame rate. Water shadows and reflections have now also been enabled, and there's the power to render more boats on screen at once.</p>

<p>It sounds like some welcome changes, especially given that our main gripes with the game back in 2022 were on the technical side of things. "While it isn’t perfectly put together, and the playful nature of the graphics might not be to everyone’s taste," we wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/sail-forth">our review</a>, "Sail Forth has more going for it than against it." Hey, it might just be the perfect way to unwind on a grey January evening.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Even though we've just entered a new era of Nintendo of America, Reggie Fils-Aimé is still <em>the</em> name most people associate with the role. And, speaking at this weekend's New York Game Awards, the former NoA president shared a little tidbit about his time early on in his career at Nintendo (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/only-a-week-into-his-job-nintendo-legend-reggie-fils-aime-had-to-deal-with-retailers-upset-there-werent-enough-copies-of-pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire-i-never-let-that-happen-ever-again/">Gamesradar+</a>!)</p>
<p>Just a week into his role as executive vice president of sales, Reggie had to deal with an issue surrounding one of Nintendo's biggest names — <strong>Pokémon</strong>, specifically the first GBA titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a>.</p>
<p>He didn't bring this up by coincidence — Reggie was at the ceremony presenting the Andrew Yoon Legend Award to the franchise. And it's here where he brought up his first professional brush with the series which he says he "had a long history with Pokémon when I was at Nintendo."</p>
<p>Kicking off, Reggie told the audience about his first week at Nintendo in 2003: "I has just joined the company and [was] there for only about a week when I had to work with our retail partners because they literally did not have enough copies of Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Emerald [note: Reggie probably means Sapphire as Emerald launched in the West in 2005] for the Christmas rush."</p>
<p>Reggie recalls that retailer were understandably "a little upset", and given the huge popularity of the series even then, that's pretty understandable. It was an early test, and lesson, for the then-new exec, who said that "I never let that happen ever again."</p>
<figure data-uuid="74299cdf66f71"><a title="Pokemon Ruby &amp; Sapphire" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74299cdf66f71/pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2wqNVnh2OE">The Pokémon Company</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reggie concluded his speech with this, before rolling a heartfelt clip from industry members sharing their memories of the series: "I always enjoyed working with The Pokémon Company and I loved all of their games — even the Pokémon Plus controller [the Poké Ball Plus] with the Mew inside, remember that? One of my favourites."</p>
<p>So, perhaps not the best start, but at least it allowed Reggie to make things right quickly <em>and</em> improve relations between Nintendo and TPC. So, all in all, a valuable moment in his career.</p>
<p>You can catch Reggie's speech, as well as the Andrew Yoon Legend Award presentation, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/9HNNugGXKQ0?si=tBiw7yKiXHycUgkC&amp;t=10196">around 2:49:56</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed the entire awards ceremony, you may have also missed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/im-excited-to-meet-you-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-public-appearance-as-president-of-noa">Reggie introducing the newest Nintendo of America president</a>, Devon Pritchard, making her first public appearance since she took over the role at the start of the year.</p>
