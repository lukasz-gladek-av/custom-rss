<figure data-uuid="680022446b5f1"><a title="Pokémon Presents February 2026 - 30th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/680022446b5f1/pokemon-presents-february-2026-30th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>A Pokémon Presents showcase on Pokémon Day? Whatever will they think of next!</p>
<p>Yes, TPC is back with its yearly showcase <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">on 27th February 2026</a>, but this is a big one, because it marks <em>30 years</em> since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red and Blue</a> first burst onto the scene in Japan back in 1996.</p>
<p>Now, these presentations have been known to be a little on the app-heavy side of things, if we're being generous, but the promise of a big birthday celebration has us feeling optimistic that there <em>might</em> be something surprising in store, too. Heck, we've already had a big surprise in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> on the eShop.</p>
<p>We've got 25 minutes of Pocket Monster news ahead of us next week, so, stocked up on this glass-half-full attitude, we've each shared some of the predictions for the coming showcase below. Will any of them come true? We'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<h2>Gen 10</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b0e0b21b33d6"><a title="Pikachu on Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b0e0b21b33d6/pikachu-on-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Will the next Gen be a Switch 2 exclusive? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Oh yes, it's definitely getting revealed this time. I can totally imagine it being nothing more than a brief teaser and name drop, potentially even with a '2027' release window attached to it (can we really get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Champions</a>, <em>and</em> a new Gen all in one year?), but either way, this is the time to make the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I always approach Pokémon Presents with extreme caution, but they've done a fair job recently of speeding through the updates I'm less interested in and getting to the 'big' stuff. At the very least, I expect a 10th-Gen tease with your token "Please look forward to more information later in the year", especially now they've got the Red/Green re-release announcement out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Like everyone else here, I too think we'll get a Gen 10 teaser. Part of me thinks it'd be weird to have such a big anniversary year go by without the games releasing in 2026, but I can't see it happening right now, even if it has been four years since Gen 9. We might see one new Pokémon, too — can't have everyone left on tenterhooks for over a year now, can we?</p>
<h2>Remakes</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26ed32f1f4283"><a title="Pokémon White" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26ed32f1f4283/pokemon-white.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A remake <em>still</em> isn't black and white... — <em><span></span> Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> No more mainline remakes, please. I fear for what'll happen to my favourite gen. Instead, I think TPC should remake one of the weird spin-offs. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_ranger">Pokémon Ranger</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_art_academy">Art Academy</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hey_you_pikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a> There's a microphone on the Switch 2 <em>right there</em>. You could make it, I don't know, work!</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Looking at the Pokémon release cycle, we are due a remake sometime soon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a> were a <em>long</em> time ago, and I swear those darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white">Black &amp; White</a> remakes have been rumoured every single year since. Honestly, though, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">HeartGold / SoulSilver</a> that I'm praying for the most — we <em>need</em> a way to play those on modern hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Could they redo Kanto <em>again?</em> Of course they could, even after the FireRed and LeafGreen news, but that might stretch nostalgia to breaking point. Like Jim, expect some Black/White or Gold/Silver action.</p>
<h2>Apps</h2>
<figure data-uuid="70bd212d81702"><a title="Pokémon Sleep" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70bd212d81702/pokemon-sleep.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No, <em>we're</em> awake during this segment. — <em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> I mean, this'll be the bulk of the presentation, right? We'll get a new app or two, for sure. I kinda want a <strong>Tamagotchi</strong>-style app with Pokémon on my phone. Let me have a little Growlithe with me 24/7. But more than likely, it'll be an app that reminds you to drink water or something.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Yeah, this is the coolest take of the lot. Far too much of the presentation will be dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Pokémon Masters EX</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Sleep</a>, but I will be excited to hear any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">TCG Pocket</a> news.</p>
<h2>Non-Gaming News</h2>
<figure data-uuid="b8e8deefbc959"><a title="Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu - Wooloo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b8e8deefbc959/pokemon-tales-the-misadventures-of-sirfetchrd-and-pichu-wooloo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yeah, same, Wooloo — <em><span></span> Image: Aardman Animations</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> A tease for further Lego sets. A little Mew/Mewtwo diorama? A Legendary Bird aviary? A second mortgage?</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> We've seen far too little of Aardman's <strong>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu</strong>, and it's supposed to be coming our way <em>next year</em>. Come on, chuck, give me more than a brief teaser!</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Pokémon Day Out and Pokémon Night Out — what <em>are</em> they? We'll probably find out here.</p>
<h2>An NSO Drop?</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a5c74accff1b4"><a title="Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness coming to GameCube NSO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a5c74accff1b4/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness-coming-to-gamecube-nso.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Where are they??? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> As much as I'd love to see Gens I-III crop up on the GB/GBA libraries (ignoring FRLG, of course), something tells me that ain't going to happen (not when so many of us would gladly cough up and pay for a collection). Let's go for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_pinball_ruby_and_sapphire">Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a> instead, then.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <del>I don't see them coming to NSO, but if Game Freak had the excuse that a standalone release lets them implement <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Home</a> transfer support, that just might get the pitchforks lowered.</del> Well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-officially-revealed-for-switch">that did that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_xd_gale_of_darkness">XD: Gale of Darkness</a> are still missing, and they're part of the confirmed lineup. Can we actually get them on NSO this time around???</p>
<h2>Wildcard</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6ff1955131e01"><a title="Pikachu Pokémon Anime" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ff1955131e01/pikachu-pokemon-anime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Blue-sky thinking? — <em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> A new Pokémon Mystery Dungeon. Not a remake, not an NSO drop, a brand new one. If it happens, thank me later. (If it doesn't, please don't hate me.)</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> New peripheral time: <strong>Pokéwalker 2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I say it every year, and I'll say it again: <strong>Detective Pikachu 2</strong>. Ryan Reynolds hasn't starred in a blockbuster for a solid two days at the time of writing, so it must be about time.</p>
