<p>Hall effect sticks? Check</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PowerA has launched a new wireless controller for the Switch 2 (with compatibility confirmed for the OG, Lite, and OLED too), boasting features that could give the official Pro Controller a run for its money.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£54.99 / $69.99</strong>, the Advantage Wireless Controller will come in three flavours: Black, Mario &amp; Friends, and Pokémon: Mega Evolutions. It comes with Hall Effect analogue sticks, motion controls, a dedicated C button, mappable back buttons, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, being a third-party pad, you're not going to get <em>everything</em>, so NFC amiibo support isn't here, and it doesn't seem like these controllers will have wake-up support for the Switch 2 either. Still, at £20 less than the $89.99 asking price for the Pro Controller, the monetary saving could potentially make up for these exclusions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>• Hall Effect Modules:</strong> Contact-free magnetic sensors in the thumbsticks provide a more fluid pro-level feel and help with precision and longevity<strong><br>
• Advanced Gaming Buttons:</strong> Get an edge over the competition with mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons you can program on the fly, mid-game—no system settings to configure<strong><br>
• Intuitive Motion Controls:</strong> Get immersed in your games with fluid, responsive motion controls that provide an intuitive way to aim, steer, fly, and more<strong><br>
• C Button:</strong> Easily activate fun GameChat features<strong><br>
• Rechargeable Battery:</strong> Get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. Includes an extra-long 10 ft. USB-C cable to recharge the internal battery*<strong><br>
• Ergonomic Design:</strong> Game for hours with a controller that feels great in your hands, thanks to cutting-edge ergonomics and top-of-the-line materials<strong><br>
• Nintendo Family Compatibility:</strong> Works with the Nintendo Switch system of devices: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and Nintendo Switch Lite<strong><br>

<p>Game launches this month!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (with a brief mention of the OG Switch version at the end), providing more than 6 minutes of information on the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>, Z-A is the sort-of-sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> and takes place in Lumiose City with a revamped real-time battle system. The trailer goes over this along with the character customisation features, photo mode, the 'Z-A Royale Tournament', and more.</p>
<p>If you think the game looks a bit naff visually, you're not alone, and this trailer won't do much to convince you otherwise (though the interiors in 'Hotel Z' look pretty nice, admittedly), but it definitely looks like a pretty neat take on the long-running series nonetheless. We're pretty concerned about how this might look and run on the original Switch, though.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. Some of the new mechanics and modes here sound genuinely interesting, and hopefully this will more than make up for any visual or performance shortcomings.</p>
<p>Legends: Z-A will also offer up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension DLC</a> for <strong>£24.99</strong>, with early adopters receiving apparel sets on day one, with a story expansion arriving at some point before the end of February 2026.</p>
