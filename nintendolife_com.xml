<figure data-uuid="55d0ce9c13177"><a title="Aaron Judge MLB The Show 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/55d0ce9c13177/aaron-judge-mlb-the-show-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the arrival of the Switch 2, we've finally been getting some parity across the multiplatform sports games across all consoles, with EA and 2K's offerings being much-better than their Switch 1 counterparts.</p>
<p>We thought we'd see the same from Sony's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_26">MLB The Show 26</a>, which has <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-reveal-aaron-judge/">been confirmed</a> for a <strong>17th March 2026</strong> release alongside the reveal of cover star Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees, who is returning to front for the second time.</p>
<p>But Sony Interactive Entertainment's next entry is opting to stay on the Switch 1 and isn't coming to the Switch 2 right now. Of course, it may be that developer San Diego Studio doesn't have access to Switch 2 dev kits, but it's a rather strange decision from the outside.</p>
<p>As usual, a gameplay reveal will follow next week on <strong>3rd February</strong>, where you'll likely get a small glimpse at Switch gameplay. We're not holding our breath for any improvements, so <em>maybe</em> a Switch 2 port is coming later in the year.</p>

<p>Besides that, pre-orders for the Standard and Digital Deluxe Editions — the latter of which will grant Early Access, allowing you to play the game from13th March (unlikely on Switch, of course) — open after the gameplay reveal on 3rd February at <strong>12 pm EST/ 9 am PST</strong> at certain retailers, digital storefronts, and on the game's <a href="http://theshow.com/">official website</a>.</p>
