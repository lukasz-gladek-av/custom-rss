<figure><a title="Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b36a67bb839c/grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>Marvelous Europe has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> has sold over 500,000 copies since its launch on <strong>27th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Specific figures across Switch, Switch 2, and PC have not been confirmed, but we've reached out and will update this article when we hear more. Nevertheless, it's a solid performance for the game after such a short period of time, and it seems that most are in agreement that it's probably one of the best entries in the series for quite some time.</p>
<p>Marvelous Europe also shared the following piece of artwork to commemorate the milestone:</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436vitylu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylLGp-DIVlY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Grand Bazaar on Switch and Switch 2 is a remake of the DS title Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar and we thought it was really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">quite good</a>. We said that it "might not have the depth of other farming sims, but it's fantastic to control, and the well-written characters alongside the many tasks and calendar packed with events to occupy your time, make you feel like part of a bustling little community".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Natsume's latest title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_home_sweet_home_special_edition">Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home Special Edition</a> will launch on the Switch on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>. This one originally launched on iOS and Android in August 2024 and was supposedly the "biggest Harvest Moon game ever" on mobile devices.</p>

<p>How magical</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a>, ININ and Smallthing Studios' prequel to the classic 1993 point and click adventure, is finally and thankfully up and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Simon-the-Sorcerer-Origins-2884080.html">available for pre-order on Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£22.49 / $24.99</strong> for the standard edition or <strong>£31.99 / $34.99</strong> for a digital deluxe version (which nets you a digital art book and soundtrack alongside the game), this surprise prequel was announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/simon-the-sorcerer-origins-reignites-the-classic-point-and-click-series-on-switch-next-year">all the way back in 2023</a>, and had a 2024 window of release initially. But it's finally on the way on <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. Oh, and if you pre-order, you get a free DLC Pony. Contain yourselves.</p>
<p>We're trying our best to ignore the elephant in the room here, but yes, you you read the headline right. Rick Astley. The icon. The phenomenon. The legend. The guy who sang that song about not giving up that one time in the 1980s. We know <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2023/07/simon-the-sorcerer-origins-will-feature-music-from-reads-notes-rick-astley">it's <em>slightly</em> old news</a>, but let us have this.</p>
<p>Alongside Astley's music, who has become an internet sensation over the years thanks to the whole Rick-rolling thing, Simon's original voice actor, the fantabulous Mr. Chris Barrie (everyone's <a href="https://reddwarf.co.uk/">favourite annoying hologram b*****d</a>), is returning<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Now, here are some further deets from the official press release for your delectation!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Over three decades have passed since <em>Simon the Sorcerer</em> first cast his spell on adventure game fans. <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> invites players to step back into his world, this time to discover how it all began. Longtime fans will be thrilled to know that <strong>the original voice actors return in both English (Chris Barrie) and German (Erik Borner)</strong>, adding an extra layer of authenticity and nostalgia to this lovingly crafted hand-drawn origin story.</p>
<p>The magic doesn’t stop at the visuals, as <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> comes alive with a brand-new original soundtrack by acclaimed composer Mason Fischer, perfectly capturing the whimsy, wonder, and emotional depth of Simon’s enchanting world. And as a very special surprise, <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> includes <strong>music icon Rick Astley</strong> in a special role - bringing a touch of 80s soul to the fantasy adventure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as the screens we've seen of this one thus far do look a <em>little tiny bit</em> like a mobile game in nature, it has got the rest of the general vibe pretty much spot-on for Simon's point and click adventures.</p>
<p>Plus, having the original cast and pop royalty along for the ride is giving us hope for something that delivers in its script and soundtrack!</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to some Simon the Sorcerer point and click action later this year? Let us know.</em></p>
