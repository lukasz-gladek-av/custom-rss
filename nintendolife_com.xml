<p>We wouldn't HATE it if he was correct</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Yes, we already reported a little while back that well-known YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate">NateTheHate</a>, has suggested that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-set-to-take-place-later-this-month-its-claimed">Nintendo Direct is incoming</a> sometime in and around July. That's this month!</p>
<p>Speaking on his YouTube show, Mr TheHate (hope we got that right) had said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I have been told... There is a Direct this month, so the month of July. But, that Direct will not take place until after Donkey Kong Bananza releases. Beyond that, I have no additional information, I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st, right, which is Nintendo's earning report day. So I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investor's report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it seems he has now doubled down on this belief, with precious little time left for it to transpire. As seen over <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">on on his social media</a> (cheers <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/natethehate-states-again-that-he-believes-nintendo-direct-happening-this-month/">MyNintendoNews</a>), in answering another poster, Nate reveals that "to my knowledge"the Direct is still on the cards.</p>
<figure><a title="DIRECT IN JULY?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7f16c52ccdeb/direct-in-july.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: x/@natethehate2</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nate has been reliable in the past, getting the Switch 2 announcement date correct, as an example, but we will all just have to wait and see with this one. At least there's not too long to go either way. One thing that may add a little credence, though, and it's something we've also reported on already, is that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-major-third-party-devs-reportedly-sitting-on-multiple-switch-2-announcements">a whole bunch of major devs are sitting on "multiple Switch 2 announcements".</a></p>
<p>Let's keep our fingers crossed that he's right, and a big juicy content drop is just around yonder corner.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Reckon there'll be a Direct in the window Nate points out? Looking forward to anything being announced in particular? make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>

<figure><a title="grounded peer to peer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/29ce1cc0c3a7d/grounded-peer-to-peer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Obsidian</em></figcaption></figure><p>We reviewed Obsidian's excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> back when it released on Switch last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grounded">giving it a 7/10</a> and remarking that it was really only the game's performance on the console that held it back from a much better score.</p>
<p>Indeed, Grounded, when it's running well, is perhaps one of our favourite survival games of the past console generation or two. With this in mind, and given that the game does now perform better if you happen to have a Switch 2 (well, it's much less blurry, that's for sure), Switch players may be wondering if it's going to suddenly disappear, now that the dev has moved onto the final prep phase for Grounded 2 (which sadly is only aiming at xbox and PC, for now).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vnzhgs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Thankfully, during an interview (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Eurogamer</a>) the game's executive producer, Marcus Morgan, has said that, "We actually have this strong passion to ensure our games can stand the test of time and keep updating through history...There's a strong desire on our side to make sure that our games are preserved,"</p>
<p>He continued, "Now, are we going to be doing content and these story expansions to Grounded 1? No, that's the continuation of Grounded 2. But even as recently as April we released 1.4.7 to Grounded 1, so there's a maintenance and a desire that that game will always exist. So we'll keep that up, it's not going anywhere if people still want to play Grounded 1 as well." They did also give us gyro controls in an update last year, so you can't knock the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Recently, of course, there's been a little extra attention on what happens with games when they've had their time in the limelight, with groups such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">Stop Killing Games</a> drawing attention to the issues faced when games are taken offline.</p>
<p>To this end, Morgan gets a little more detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the things that we did in terms of how we structured Grounded is multiplayer is done through peer-to-peer, which in first blush, feels antiquated versus dedicated servers. But we were able to blend that with shared worlds, and what that does is it allows you, effectively, a cloud save that you can share with your friends. So it gives that experience of being able to have a more dedicated server vibe, but it doesn't have that same requirement of actually having servers.</p>
<p>And this is no commentary on the Stop Killing Games stuff or anything like that...More to say it does establish (the game) so it can exist into the future a lot easier than if you're on the other side, where you are more of a server-based game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while we wait and hope that Grounded gets one last switch drop in the form of a gentle Switch 2 upgrade (you know you want to, Obsidian), us Grounded fans can at least rest assured in the knowledge that the game isn't just gonna disappear on us. Probably.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Elgato has announced that its latest 4K-capable capture card, the cunningly-named Elgato 4K S, is 100% compatible with the Switch 2 - and it's a<a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/game-capture-4k-s">vailable for purchase right now!</a> (Thanks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elgatos-new-game-capture-4k-s-is-switch-2-compatible-164745527.html">Engadget</a>).</p>
<p>The 4K S, which is also the most budget-friendly card in Elgato's range, coming in at a price of $159.99/£149.99, sits externally to almost any console you can think of, to capture your latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> antics at up to 4K/60fps with zero-latency passthrough.</p>
<p>The card replaces the ever-popular Elgato HD60 X, which was only capable of 4k/30fps (and was more expensive at launch), and you can betcha there's gonna be some clamouring for them right here at Nintendo Life HQ. Oh yes, sir.</p>
<p>Here's some more official details from Elgato:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Capture in True 4K60<br></strong>Capture crystal-clear 4K gameplay at a silky-smooth 60 frames per second. Colors pop, details shine, and your footage looks amazing in every moment. On Windows, you can even capture vibrant 1080p HDR gameplay, perfect for bringing cinematic moments to life.</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay First, Capture Second<br></strong>4K S keeps your games smooth and responsive while you record. You can:<br>
Enjoy full <strong>4K60 passthrough</strong> with <strong>HDR and VRR</strong>, so your gameplay stays crisp and tear-free<br>
Chasing higher frame rates? Play at up to <strong>1080p240</strong> or <strong>1440p144</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next-gen ready by design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2<br></strong>Capture gameplay in 4K60, 1440p120, or 1080p60 HDR while you play titles like <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Capture Audio, Your Way<br></strong>Thanks to 4K S’s ultra-low latency, you don’t need extra gear to monitor or record game audio.<br>
Need real-time audio to your headset? Chat Link Pro delivers zero-latency audio for both game and chat, ideal when timing is everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With regards to the card itself, and whether or not you should be excited to run out and nab one, well our very own Alex, the lovely person, is a bit of an expert when it comes to these things and he's weighed in with some buyer's advice from his time with the 4K X, which we'll stick here for further reading!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's always great to see cheaper hardware appear alongside premium options, but I do think it's important to consider Elgato's software support with the 4K X, which is less than stellar to say the least. I've been using the card for the Switch 2 since before launch, and at every turn I've had to either sacrifice control, quality, or performance.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I've battled with dropped frames, terrible HDR tonemapping, a lack of audio downmixing, sync drift, and many other problems besides. OBS seems to be the way to go, as their own software comes with its own issues and you'll have to sacrifice all sense of control.When the card works, it works well, but if the 4K S is anything like its big brother, be prepared for a lot of frustrating hoops and hurdles to achieve acceptable results. Just be wary before taking the plunge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we're off to record some primo footage of our best run in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/balan_wonderworld">Balan Wonderworld.</a> Beautiful 4K Wonderworld...</p>
