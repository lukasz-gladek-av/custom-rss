<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> launches for the Switch 2 next month, and in case you missed it, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will be adding a variety of retro games.</p>
<p>Our colleagues at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sega-classic-emergency-call-ambulance-comes-to-ps5-ps4-via-yakuza-3-remake">covered one of these reveals</a> in December, and more recently, Sega lifted the lid on the inclusion of Game Gear titles. According to its latest press release, this is the first time in the series' history that the classic handheld is playable in-game.</p>
<p>Now, in another development, it's been announced Game Gear versions of three Bandai Namco titles will also be playable. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pac_man">Pac-Man</a>, the action platform title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_mappy">Mappy</a> and the space shooter <strong>Galaga '91</strong>.</p>

<p>These games will join the previously revealed Game Gear title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_chaos">Sonic Chaos</a>. <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sega-classic-emergency-call-ambulance-comes-to-ps5-ps4-via-yakuza-3-remake">Emergency Call Ambulance</a></strong> is also breaking free from arcades, and it's been confirmed the arcade beat 'em up <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/arcade-beat-em-up-slashout-joins-emergency-call-ambulance-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-on-ps5-ps4">SlashOut</a></strong> will also be included in the retro line up. You can read a little more about this one <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/arcade-beat-em-up-slashout-joins-emergency-call-ambulance-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-on-ps5-ps4">over on Push Square</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Sega's latest Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties news drop has introduced more substories, 'LaLaLa Loveland (a brand-new social platform), cell phone customisation, the latest Karaoke offerings and outfits Kiryu can rock and much more.</p>

<p>Sorry, Switch fans</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has announced its first Switch Online game trial of 2026 for North America. It's also apparently the first time a trial has been exclusive to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">EA Sports Madden NFL 26</a>, which launched on the Switch 2 in August last year. This game trial is available between now and <strong>21st January 2026</strong>, and gives players access to the "full" game. If you don't have a subscription, Nintendo is also currently offering a free 7-day online trial in this region.</p>
<figure data-uuid="40373e9090e46"><a title="Madden NFL 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40373e9090e46/madden-nfl-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you do decide to purchase this game, you'll be able to get the digital version for 60% off its regular price until 25th January 2026, reducing it from <strong>$69.99 USD / $89.99 CAD</strong> to <strong>$27.99 USD / $35.99 CAD</strong>. Save data will also carry over to the full game, so you can continue on. There's a chance to earn 100 My Nintendo Points just by playing this Game Trial as well.</p>
<p>You can find out a bit more about this title in our review here on Nintendo Life. We gave it eight out of ten stars, calling it a "very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory".</p>

<p>A "shared commitment" to improve player safety</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7cb1d126e56a6"><a title="Nintendo, Sony, Xbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7cb1d126e56a6/nintendo-sony-xbox.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>In 2020, the major players in the console space Nintendo, Sony and Xbox announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/nintendo_playstation_and_xbox_announce_a_shared_commitment_to_safer_gaming">"shared commitment to safer gaming"</a> to "improve player safety" across each platform.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this year, and these shared principles have now been updated to ensure they represent the "constant efforts" to keep each of these game communities safe. Here's a bit more about this via Nintendo's official news release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"We believe gaming is for everyone and strive to provide experiences that are positive and enjoyable for all, especially for our youngest players. We work to accomplish this by pursuing a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced technology, research-driven insights, supportive community efforts, and skilled human oversight...Our latest shared principles reflect new innovations in player safety that have evolved with technological advancements, and new ways in which we collaborate through key industry initiatives and with trade associations."</em></p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ojmwkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The safer gaming principles cover <strong>Prevention</strong>, <strong>Partnership</strong> and <strong>Responsibility</strong>. Here's the rundown of each category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prevention: Empower players and parents to understand and control gaming experiences</strong></p>
<p>- We provide controls that let players customize their gaming experience. We support parents with the tools and information necessary to help them customize appropriate gaming experiences for their children.</p>
<p>- We recognize that for safety features to be useful, they must be easy to use and understand. We promote the availability of our safety tools and provide guidance on how to use them through our platforms, support channels, services, on our websites, and in retail stores to reach more players and parents.</p>
<p>- We inform our parents and players about our codes of conduct and terms of use to support positive gaming experiences for everyone. We enforce these policies through a variety of preventive and remedial measures. We design our products with transparency and player empowerment at their core, aiming to make experiences that are intuitive and respect players’ choices.</p>
<p><strong>Partnership: We partner with industry peers, publishers, regulators, law enforcement, and our communities to advance player safety</strong></p>
<p>- Our commitment to safety is central, and we believe collaboration benefits the video game industry and all players by fostering safe gaming experiences.</p>
<p>- We partner and engage with global and regional industry trade organizations, industry members, regulators, law enforcement, non-profit organizations, and experts to develop and/or advance online safety initiatives. These include <a href="https://thrivingingames.org/"><strong>Thriving in Games Group,</strong></a> the <a href="https://fosi.org/"><strong>Family Online Safety Institute</strong></a>, and others.</p>
<p>- We conduct shared research to inform policy decisions and to drive industry innovation. Individually, we have engaged with external research centers that study play and wellbeing.</p>
<p>- We partner with our community to promote safe gaming behavior and encourage the use of reporting tools to call out bad actors, and we have tools and processes in place to support rapid response to emerging incidents.</p>
<p>- We collaborate with ratings agencies such as the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/"><strong>ESRB</strong></a> and <a href="https://pegi.info/"><strong>PEGI</strong></a>, among others, to ensure that our games are rated for the appropriate audience, and work closely with the Entertainment Software Association and other trade associations to share <a href="https://www.theesa.com/trust-safety/"><strong>trust &amp; safety information</strong></a> designed to educate and promote positive play experiences.</p>
<p>- We invest in leading technology and proactive collaboration to help thwart improper conduct and content. We participate in key industry initiatives, including the <a href="https://technologycoalition.org/"><strong>Tech Coalition</strong></a> and its <a href="https://technologycoalition.org/programs/lantern/"><strong>Lantern</strong></a> program, that are dedicated to enhancing child safety through technology, knowledge-sharing, and transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility: We hold ourselves accountable for making our platforms as safe as possible for all players</strong></p>
<p>- We make it easy for players to report violations of our codes of conduct and community guidelines, which we work to refine and evolve to support our player communities.</p>
<p>- In addition to removing content not suitable for our services, we take appropriate enforcement actions for violations, including restricting players from using our services for misconduct, with escalating restrictions for egregious or repeat violations. We engage in responsible and transparent practices, including the ethical use of all data, and deploy process enhancement technologies with skilled human oversight.</p>
<p>- We comply with all applicable laws in the places we do business and respond to legitimate requests from law enforcement. We promptly notify law enforcement if we observe unlawful conduct or where we believe a player is at risk of imminent harm.</p>
<p>- We publish our rules and requirements, and we ensure that players who have been reported understand the requirements for continued engagement with our platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's reiterated at the end of this update how this partnership is about "collaborating on solutions" to enhance player safety and ensure games continue to be welcoming to everyone. It also invites others to "commit to the safety and well-being of players everywhere".</p>
