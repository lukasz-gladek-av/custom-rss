<p>With a free demo to come</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Wishfully Studios and Thunderful's cinematic puzzle/platforming sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</a>, has looked more stunning with every gameplay reveal. Its latest trailer is no exception, of course, but this one comes with a bonus bit of info: a release date.</p>
<p>Yes, it has been revealed that Children of the Leaf will leap onto Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong> — that's just one month away! What's more, the developer has confirmed that a free demo is in the pipeline too, arriving on PC, PlayStation and Xbox on 11th Feb, and on Switch and Switch 2 at a "later date".</p>
<p>The release date trailer showcases even more puzzle platforming in action, with those visuals once again being the star of the show. Previous gameplay showcases have highlighted Lana's cute companion, Mui, and its transforming abilities, and we get to see a little more here, with the little guy taking on the form of a fish and a flying insect, piloting robots, and channelling electrical currents — way to go, Mui!</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's setup and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As greed and power divide the tribes of their home planet, Lana and her loyal companion Mui must stand together against the forces reshaping their world - struggling not just for survival, but for the very soul of their home. Embark on an unforgettable cinematic puzzle journey across Novo, where ancient mysteries and new threats will test your wits, challenge Lana’s unbreakable bond with Mui, and guide her toward her destiny.<br>
Prepare to explore an expanded story, tackle challenging new puzzles, and master evolved companion mechanics - all brought to life by breathtaking hand-painted environments and a sweeping orchestral soundtrack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be excited to see what this one holds when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 next month — hopefully we don't have to wait too long for the demo, either. We had a great time with its predecessor back in 2024, calling it "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

<p>Future events will reuse old job scenarios</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c8e29bf52856f"><a title="Splatoon 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8e29bf52856f/splatoon-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>'s "regular updates" came to a close back in September 2024, but the recurring Eggstra Work events have continued to land new job scenarios (the predetermined shift conditions) in the years since. That is until this month, when they, too, are wrapping up.</p>
<p>Shared in a post by the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonJP" tabindex="-1">@SplatoonJP</a> X account (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3me6yskwgji2w">@Oatmealdome</a> on Bluesky), Nintendo confirmed that the next Eggstra Work will be the last to feature new job scenarios. While more Eggstra Work shifts will crop up in the future, they will use previous scenarios instead — which should make planning a little easier, at least.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12etkmjhw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As a reminder, the next event runs from <strong>14th-15th February</strong>, and will be held in the Bonerattle Arena.</p>
<figure data-uuid="64d84e0360060"><a title="Splatoon 3 Eggstra Work" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64d84e0360060/splatoon-3-eggstra-work.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Splatoon 3's seasonal Splatfests are still alive and well, even these special events have started reusing old themes from Splatoons past. With Eggstra Work following suit, we guess things really are coming to an end.</p>
<p>We still don't have word of any 'Splatoon 4' just yet. Last year, Nintendo revealed the story-focused spin-off, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, though news on this front has been quiet ever since. Then, late last month, an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">age rating for Splatoon 3</a> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">on Switch 2</a></em> appeared on the PEGI website, prompting rumours that the series' 2022 entry might be getting the 'Switch 2 Edition' treatment down the line.</p>
