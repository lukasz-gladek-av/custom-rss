<figure data-uuid="453b8fd48c35f"><a title="Go Go Power Rangers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/453b8fd48c35f/go-go-power-rangers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo’s relationship with the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-monster-hunter-games-ranked-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Monster Hunter</a></strong> series is an intriguing one – in one sense it’s at the heart of the IP with timed exclusives, but it’s also missed out on two blockbuster mainline entries in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world">World</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Wilds</a>; perhaps Switch 2 will remedy that shortcoming. The spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Amonster-hunter-stories"><strong>Stories</strong> series</a>, however, started out as a late-gen 3DS game and the series has kept on coming to Nintendo hardware ever since.</p>
<p>The first two games offer a good time for those new to the IP, or fans that want an adventure a little less intense and challenging. They were largely (though not exclusively) cutesy in style, and while that’s still partially true with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, this does feel like an entry that’s following its audience. If you were young when you played the original, this may now fit well into your older sensibilities. It’s still charming and easygoing at times, but the tone has shifted a little.</p>
<p>In terms of narrative, Twisted Reflection, like the two games before it, goes off on its own; you don’t need to be familiar with its predecessors to dive in here. The storytelling at times feels a little like modern <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> – gorgeous cutscenes in the preview section (the first 6-8 hours of the game) tell the tale of tensions between two nations, a world of endangered monster species and ecological collapse. There are some heavy themes, but they’re told with dashes of hope, and your role as a Prince and Ranger sees you working to improve the world in multiple ways.</p><figure data-uuid="829cfd76af4d8"><a title="It's a draw" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829cfd76af4d8/its-a-draw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right from the start, the storytelling, <em>gorgeous</em> orchestral music and cast of characters will draw you in. As a Monster Hunter RPG, it has a slow-ish opening hour, but after that I felt in a similar flow as I have in big-name genre IPs from the likes of Square Enix, Atlus, and Monolith Soft; Capcom’s team has evidently continued to mature in its approach to making an RPG that devours hours in each play session.</p>
<p>What’s also encouraging is that it’s done this while retaining the Stories style, at least in the early going. As in previous entries, you gradually build up a team of ‘Monsties’, cute takes on iconic franchise beasts that you can ride and team up with in battle, along with a companion and their Monstie.</p>
<p>Battles themselves retain the rock-paper-scissors approach, though with impressive depth. Initially, I have stuck to the same three weapon types, each of which can target specific monster parts with each move, but there are various others I haven’t yet touched.</p>
<p>Even in the early running, there looks to be a dizzying amount of detail for those that seek it, and it’ll be interesting to see if — like its predecessors — this is at least partially optional. Ways to customise and evolve Monsties return, gathering eggs to rear creatures to then release and revive regional ecologies seems prevalent, and already stores and armourers are offering <em>a lot</em> of tools to eventually get you through a presumably tough end-game. I’ll be intrigued to see how deep these mechanics go, how <em>necessary</em> they are to surviving towards the end, and just how fabulous our fashion can get as we encounter more monster types in the world.</p><figure data-uuid="0dbdb013d6717"><a title="It's a big world" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0dbdb013d6717/its-a-big-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the opening sections it also seems that, beyond mechanical depth, this game is setting up for a decent amount of pure content. The story itself has — so far — introduced some key threads and then reached a dramatic denouement to set the scene for ‘Chapter 2’, but I’ve also enjoyed diving into side quests and side stories. The former are mostly basic ‘collect these things’ or ‘defeat this monster’, but the latter take you into little standalone vignettes with each companion in which you learn a little more about them. Even early on with only ‘Chapter 1’ for each side story available so far, there’s been a fair bit of gameplay variety and oodles of charm.</p>
<p>So far, so good. That said, I do have a mix of praise and minor issues around performance in this current version 1.0 build. As mentioned before, cutscenes — including those delivered in-engine — look and sound fantastic; I would also like to give a nod to the voice acting so far. While praise is generally given to RE Engine, this title is still clearly working on the foundations from the previous games; often it looks gorgeous, but sometimes it goes the other way.</p>
<p>Frame rate is <em>okay</em>, too. It's generally reasonable but appears to be unlocked and can veer from around 30fps at most times to occasional 60fps flashes in cutscenes (like combat special moves) or enclosed areas like caves. Docked play is better than handheld at present, as the image is certainly a good deal softer in the portable configuration. There are also regular blemishes, such as textures loading in late after scene cuts, which are hard to ignore. At times, it’s a <em>little</em> scruffy.</p><figure data-uuid="77ad05838d854"><a title="Slightly over the top move" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77ad05838d854/slightly-over-the-top-move.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aggressive motion blur and frame rate inconsistencies in crowded areas, as well as some dives in resolution on handheld especially, seem like areas that can hopefully be tidied up in the final weeks before launch.</p>
<p>I should also highlight that, overall, the game does look pretty good, but just because it is miles above the fidelity of a <em>certain</em> <em>bestselling monster-catching IP</em> doesn't negate it falling below other impressive RPGs early on in the Switch 2 lifecycle. However, this 1.0 build isn’t bad by any stretch, and at times the game has a bit of a wow factor. With a little refinement, it could certainly stand out further.</p>
<p>All told, our opening dalliances with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection are full of positives. Time will tell in the many hours to come whether this ultimately sets a new bar for this rather quirky but worthwhile spin-off series.</p>

<p>With servers closing in July</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://delistedgames.com/nba-2k-playgrounds-2-wwe-2k-battlegrounds-to-be-delisted-february-20th-servers-shut-down-july-9th/">DelistedGames.com</a>, the publisher announced that you only have until <strong>20th February</strong> to pick up a digital copy of either game before it leaves the storefront for good. The games' online servers will be sticking around until <strong>9th July</strong>, when they, too, will be shutdown — "After that time, all game functions requiring online servers will no longer function," the note reads.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tyihzr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, both games <em>do</em> have a certain amount of single-player content available, so you'll still be able to play through these modes offline after the cutoff date. That said, as pointed out by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/2k-is-delisting-a-wwe-game-and-an-nba-game-later-this-month-then-shutting-both-down-in-july/">VGC</a>, a lot of 2K's in-game unlockables are frequently tied to its online servers, thanks to the reliance on real-money transactions, so there's every chance that new character and cosmetic unlocks in both games will also wrap up with the server closure.</p>
<p>While both Playgrounds and Battlegrounds each have a physical release, bypassing the delisting somewhat, it's still a shame to see them taken down from the eShop (and all other digital storefronts, it seems).</p>
<p>We had a great time with Playgrounds 2 when it arrived on Switch way back in 2018, calling it "a bright and empowering way to defy gravity like Air Jordan himself" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/nba_2k_playgrounds_2">our review</a>. Things weren't so bright for WWE Battlegrounds on Switch, which we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/wwe_2k_battlegrounds">critiqued</a> for its "limited and repetitive combat, dopey AI, an excessively locked roster and a series of bewildering design choices that really should have been questioned at some point during production" — <em>yikes</em>.</p>

<p>At least 1,200 staff taking part</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="44d4e35de71ab"><a title="Ubisoft Logo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44d4e35de71ab/ubisoft-logo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Late last month, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a> which saw, among many other things, several studio closures and six game cancellations. This week, in response to the changes, at least 1,200 Ubisoft workers have taken to the streets in a three-day international strike.</p>
<p>The strike began on 10th February and runs until today. Ubisoft Paris' Solidaires Informatique union representative, Marc Rutschlé, told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">Gamesindustry.biz</a> that the strike mainly took place in Paris, though there has also been "additional activity" at Ubisoft Milan.</p>
<p>"At this stage, it seems clear to us that [Ubisoft CEO] Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees," Rutschlé told Gamesindustry, "The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan."</p>
<p>Rutschlé said that the Ubisoft staff are "already working under pressure, often understaffed," with no meaningful pay rises in "several years". On top of this, Ubisoft has issued a return-to-office mandate to "boost the collective performance of AAA," which requires all staff to work five days a week from the Ubisoft offices — a policy that previously saw employees walk out on strike back in 2024.</p>
<p>The Solidaires Informatique union organised a smaller strike on 22nd January, the day after Ubisoft published its restructuring plan.</p>
<p>Today (12th Feb) marks the end of <em>this</em> strike, but it remains to be seen whether any further action will come in the future. Ubisoft itself will be sharing additional information on the restructure today, so we'll keep an eye out for any developments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: I Hate This Place (Switch) - A Messy Monster, But With A Certain Charm]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/i-hate-this-place</link>
            <guid>1433422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161929/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The way I see it, there are three different versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>. First, there’s the game as promised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKD83Z1RbR0">in the trailers</a>: a survival horror with some general emphasis on resource management and gunplay, all elevated with some nice-looking cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Sweeping cameras slowly reveal the ominous presence of creepily deformed lab creatures. Moody pans pass over entrail-covered woodlands. And emotive close-ups show dramatic angles of the lead character, Elena, as she searches for her friend, Lou, who went missing in the opening. It’s all very appealing. Throw in a high-end voice-over and some occasional '80s synths, and you’d be forgiven for thinking I Hate This Place was going to knock your <strong>Stranger Things</strong> socks off.</p>
<p>But the truth is the trailers are pretty damningly misleading, and not a second of that narrative flair has made it into the game. Instead, the story is told via some fixed-camera early-'00s-era cutscenes that brought back memories of a simpler time in gaming.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161931/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I say all of this because I Hate This Place comes with a fairly hefty price tag ($29.99 USD / £26.49), and I feel it’s important to give realistic expectations. If you were to compare the game to the trailer, what you’d see is more of an echo, a ghostly shimmer of what was being promised elsewhere.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t make I Hate This Place <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>As for versions two and three, well, the difference here belongs to that familiar old story – the late-night campfire tales of underpowered hardware struggling to run contemporary, seemingly demanding games. This here is a Switch ‘1’ game – and more often than not, it shows.</p>
<p>In fact, when I looked at some videos for other systems, I realised just <em>how much</em> I Hate This Place was suffering on the Switch. On more powerful hardware, the game looks pretty great. Elena’s torch casts accurate shadows from the legs of giant spiders. The shine of the spectral underworlds you visit to solve the mysterious origin stories of a number of ghosts looks great and suitably otherworldly and strange.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161932/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Switch, however, I was often distracted by visual ticks during my six-hour playthrough. Elena’s shoes sometimes clipped through textures on the floor. Cutscenes suddenly jumped back to earlier moments in the story – or ended inexplicably short. Often, ghosts disappeared instantly as if someone had forgotten to add an effect.</p>
<p>I could go on complaining, but here’s the twist: despite the lack of finesse, I had a pretty good time. For me, too many of the big releases of the last year have felt as if they were going through the motions – but with I Hate This Place, I at least felt as if developers Rock Square Thunder were reaching for the sky.</p>
<p>The core gameplay — the twin-stick shooting and combat — won me over quickly. Sneaking around, creeping past monsters, and crafting new weapons and bombs to deal with any that got too close was fun. I soon found an enjoyable balance between being cautious and gung-ho. I enjoyed throwing Molotov cocktails at mutated creatures, watching them burn, and then picking them off with a few rounds of my newly crafted rifle.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161927/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether exploring swamps or mines, the challenge felt well judged, and each section lasted just long enough. The story — loosely based on a comic series about a haunted ranch and its surrounding wilderness — does a lot of heavy lifting. It grabbed my attention early on and showed enough creativity to win me over some more.</p>
<p>Less positively, though, in larger areas the performance often fell apart, dropping to a hauntingly low couple of frames per second. Some players will find this unforgivable, but for those like me who spent the best part of the last 10 years playing compromised ports, I coped with these moments well enough. Maybe that’s a testament again to the fun gameplay.</p>
<p>The last misleading element of the trailer concerns the crafting and the building. I’ve read some takes in the last few days that painted these crafting elements as more than they are, because in truth they’re very underdeveloped – seemingly remnants of ideas that had to be canned or simplified for whatever reason. For me, crafting more bullets, upgrading a weapon or two, and keeping bandages stocked was all I ever needed, and as someone not that bothered by exhaustive resource management, I was okay with that.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161928/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I can’t give I Hate This Place a higher score than the one below. The technical issues and a lack of finesse haunt almost every nook and cranny of its game world. But I also want to stress again that it’s often very fun, too. It’s not one I’d recommend full price on Switch, but if you can tolerate uneven performance and you enjoy scrappy, experimental survival shooters, there’s something here worth playing.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I Hate This Place is a game that oversells itself in the trailer and undershoots on the Switch, but still manages to be very enjoyable. The performance issues, visual compromises, and pared‑back crafting leave their mark on much of the experience, yet the core loop of sneaking, crafting, and blasting through strange supernatural threats has enough bite to carry it.</p>
<p>When the action flows, it’s easy to see what the developers were aiming for. It just depends on whether you’re willing to look past the rough edges to enjoy what <em>does</em> work.</p></section>

<p>Lego's new Pokémon sets are right around the corner, launching on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, A.K.A. Pokémon Day.</p>
<p>If you're a little unsure as to whether these sets are right for you, Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has recently got his hands on every available product, including Eevee, Pikachu, and Charizard/Venusaur/Blastoise.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, we also get a good look at the pre-order bonus Kanto Badge set, and the Lego Insiders Mini Pokémon Center set. There are other videos available online for each individual set, but this is one gives us a glimpse at all of them in one go – nice.</p>
<p>It's a pretty decent showcase of the new sets, overall. For example, we're pretty confident that the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fpikachu-and-poke-ball-72152&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">PIkachu</a> set (£179.99 / $199.99) just isn't for us – it just looks a bit weird, don't you think? <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fvenusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">The Starter Evolutions</a> looks pretty incredible, but you'd expect that for the ludicrous price of £579.99 / $649.99, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Feevee-72151&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Eevee</a> looks okay though, and at £54.99 / $59.99, it's definitely on the more affordable end of the scale. Though to be honest, referring to any Lego set as "affordable" is probably a bit of a stretch these days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also pre-order the new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Focarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle</a> set right now for £99.99. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/video-get-a-closer-look-at-legos-new-zelda-ocarina-of-time-set-in-this-first-review">Tiago Catarino also got his hands on this set recently</a>, and we have to admit, it looks pretty sweet.</p>
