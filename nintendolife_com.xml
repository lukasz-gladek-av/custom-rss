<p>Here's the official comparison</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco recently confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a> to Nintendo platforms later this year, and it's now <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-details-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-frame-rate-and-resolution-official-comparison/">provided an official comparison</a> update on its Japanese website.</p>
<p>Here's how the new Unreal Engine 5 entry will supposedly perform on both the Switch and Switch 2. If we hear any developments about the game's performance and resolution for either platform between now and its November release, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, on Switch 2, the gameplay in Sparking! ZERO apparently runs at a maximum resolution of 810p (varying, depending on dynamic resolution) and is 30fps across both docked and portable modes. Additionally, this version of the game supports HDR.</p>
<p>As for the original Switch version, its gameplay will supposedly be "fixed" at 720p in docked and 480p in handheld, with both modes running at 30fps (although it's apparently "24fps in some menus").</p>
<p>The Nintendo versions of the game will also include local multiplayer and motion controls. There will be a Switch update as well for the physical and digital versions of the title, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco has also released some comparison screenshots of the Switch and Switch 2 versions which you can see below.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bac07c3f2b59f/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has received a new update this week, bumping the Switch 2 exclusive up to Version 1.2.1.</p>
<p>This is the first update for August, and it's a small one compared to the previous updates, addressing some bug fixes. As usual, to continue playing online, you'll need to install this latest update.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's Japanese support page:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Version 1.2.1 (19th August 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where selecting "Ghost and Race" or "Watch Replay" immediately after downloading a ghost in "Time Attack" in "View Ranking" would cause a different Ghost to play than the one you downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need the latest updated data to play online elements.</p>
<p>If you download Ver. 1.2.1, you will not be able to use "local communication" and "LAN play" with users of Ver. 1.1.2 or earlier.</p>
<hr>
<p>If we hear anything else about this update, we'll be sure to let you know. The previous update, Version 1.2.0 included a bunch of adjustments and multiple bug fixes. You can find out more about this in our existing post here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> is mostly known for regular retro soundtrack updates, but this week it's completely different, with the Japanese firm announcing we're actually getting some music from a game that's not even out yet.</p>
<p>It's songs from Masahiro Sakurai's upcoming release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Of course, this links up with the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-direct-revealed-for-tomorrow-19th-august-2025">Nintendo Direct, which is airing later today</a> and will run for a <em>whopping</em> 45 minutes.</p>
<p>This "special release" also happens to be the first Nintendo Switch 2 song update for the Switch Online music app.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We don't know what exactly to expect from Kirby Air Riders just yet, but last week, Sakurai mentioned how he was aware fans hadn't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/we-might-be-getting-an-update-about-sakurais-new-kirby-game-soon">even seen gameplay footage yet</a>. The latest Direct announcement follows on from a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">recent classification for the title</a> as well, with the game currently scheduled to launch at some point <strong>2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Illustrative text-based-bangers ahoy!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're already all clued up and in the know about Moral Anxiety Studio's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, you'll already be in the know about how it was one of the most critically acclaimed games of 2022. And now it could be repeating success on Switch as it comes to the console on 25th August 2025.</p>
<p>Preorders for this one are now available on the Nintendo eShop, and it'd be remiss of us not to point out that there's a 20% launch discount at the moment, which brings the price down to a very nice <strong>£7.91</strong> / <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/roadwarden-switch/">$8.79</a></strong> until 15th September. Yessir.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem like just another retro-styled pixel adventure at first glance, but this text-based beauty is, in fact, the sort of game that has the energy and power to resurrect an entire genre. We've played it (well, this here writer has) and this release announcement got us very excited for any Switch players out there who are interested in very good games.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set in a gritty, low-fantasy world full of mystery, danger, and moral dilemmas, <em>Roadwarden</em> puts players in the boots of a solitary traveller tasked with exploring an untamed peninsula. The game combines <strong>isometric pixel art</strong>, <strong>deep narrative design</strong>, and <strong>RPG elements</strong> such as inventory puzzles, dialogue choices, character builds, and survival mechanics.</p>
<p><em><strong>Step into the unknown. Shape your fate. And guard the roads.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Key Features – Roadwarden</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explore a Mysterious Peninsula<br></strong>Uncover secrets, dangers, and hidden stories in a richly detailed, low-fantasy<br>
world.<br>
<strong><br>
Choose Your Class and Backstory<br></strong>Play as a warrior, mage, or scholar, shaping your character’s abilities, beliefs, and personality.<br>
<strong><br>
Meaningful Choices<br></strong>Engage in deep dialogue, make the right decisions and shape the world around you.<br>
<strong><br>
Unique Genre Blend<br></strong>Combines text-based storytelling, isometric pixel art, RPG systems, and adventure mechanics.<br>
<strong><br>
30+ Hour Campaign<br></strong>Immerse yourself in a narrative-driven experience full of quests, survival elements, and moral dilemmas.</p>
<p>Every shadow hides a threat, every stranger may be a friend or a foe, and every choice could be your last. <strong>Roadwarden</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> invites a new audience to lose themselves in a world where every path is uncertain and every decision has weight. The roads are calling and only you can decide where they lead.</p>
</blockquote>
