<p>It was almost exactly a year ago that we first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a>'s 'In the Jungle' DLC at The Game Awards 2024. We got a brief look at the expansion in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-dlc-swims-onto-switch-in-2026">November Xbox Showcase</a>, but today, developer MINTROCKET has fully lifted the lid on what we can expect.</p>
<p>In a new 'Dev Dive' video, the team gives us our best look yet at the upcoming DLC, which apparently adds roughly 10 hours of gameplay to the already beefy base game.</p>
<p>We get to see the jungle village of Utara, complete with its own real-time day/night cycle, where Dave can converse with the locals, freely dive into the freshwater lake, and gather resources. It still feels a bit strange to see Dave move in a 3D plane, but the whole thing looks really rather sweet. This locale is also home to Bancho's Grill, a new restaurant to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a closer look at Dave's new diving spot, and his fresh transforming 'Jungle Gun' weapon to fend off the beasties therein.</p>

<p>It promises to be quite the expansion when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 at some point next year. MINTROCKET still hasn't shared a precise date, but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more information.</p>
