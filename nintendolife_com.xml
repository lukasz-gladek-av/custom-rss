<p>Glitch in the Matrix</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a> is a visual novel that tells the story of Mark Borja, a high school student who grapples with the usual day-to-day of teenage life while trying to figure out why he’s experiencing weird cases of déjà vu. It’s a slow burn; one that relishes in the quieter, mundane aspects of life that many TV shows and movies would rather you believe didn’t exist.</p>
<p>With beautiful pixel art visuals at its heart, Until Then feels a lot more ‘alive’ than a lot of visual novels, with dialogue and actions taking place entirely within the scene; so in other words, no ‘talking head’ sequences where static characters are nattering to one another from across the screen.</p>
<p>There is a supernatural element that slowly reveals itself, but it’s best if I keep this under wraps here. This is a game that works best with as little prior knowledge as possible, and its story will definitely tug at your heartstrings on more than one occasion through its 10-15 hour runtime.</p>
<p>Gameplay is understandably pretty limited, and you’ll spend most of your time simply pressing ‘A’ to advance the dialogue. Occasionally, you’ll be able to move left or right through the environment, and developer Polychroma Games has also seen fit to include a bunch of fun little minigames. Again, these all fit into the narrative wonderfully, so one moment you might be trying to jam a stick into some floating fishballs, and the next you’ll be playing a tune on the piano. They're really cool and help to break up the experience nicely.</p>
<p>I have to give a massive shoutout to the sound design, too. A lot of the music is composed of slow, gentle melodies no doubt designed to heighten moments of emotion, but the true star of the show is the diegetic sound. Almost all of the public scenes are bolstered by background noises of folks just going about their day; it gives a wonderful sense of place, but also a weird, ethereal feeling to the bizarre events that play out.</p>
<p>While I do appreciate a slow burn, there were definitely a few scenes that outstayed their welcome. One in particular sees Mark simply trying to keep himself entertained at home: he watches TV, plays games, and even chats to random strangers on his phone. It demonstrates his boredom and loneliness well, but I think the same goal could have been accomplished a bit quicker. Mark's bored, but that doesn’t mean I need to be.</p>
<p>This is a minor gripe, though. Until Then is a wonderful story that manages to feel both strange and relatable, and it’s well worth playing. One quick note on the Switch 2, however: the game hasn’t been optimised for the new console yet, so after a certain point early on, it simply didn’t work for me. Stick to the Switch 1 for now.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/until-then]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I had been released from the inferiority complex I’d carried for years"</p>

<figure><a title="Imamura" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1cd3b50417c0e/imamura.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It should come as no surprise that Nintendo is quite the haven for talented individuals.</p>
<p>Given the sheer quality of its products and the dedication of its development teams, we imagine Nintendo must be a pretty intimidating place for anybody. And indeed, according to <strong>Star Fox</strong> designer Takaya Imamura (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-is-so-full-of-geniuses-even-zelda-and-star-fox-veteran-takaya-imamura-felt-a-constant-sense-of-inferiority-working-with-them/">Automaton</a>), this was indeed the case during his own stint at the company.</p>
<p>In speaking on <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1938107363799798252">X</a>, he noted that he felt relieved when he left the company; not because it provided a negative experience of any kind, but rather so that the overwhelming sense of inferiority he felt could be eased. Despite his own huge contributions, it seems even Imamura felt somewhat intimidated by his talented colleagues.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hkvqyx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I really felt that Nintendo is full of amazing people, and I was constantly thinking about how to prove my own worth among them. A sense of inferiority was always lingering somewhere.</p>
<p>"When I left the company, it’s true that I felt a sense of freedom, as if I had been released from the inferiority complex I’d carried for years. But at the same time, there was also a loneliness in thinking, “I won’t be able to work with these people anymore…” That said, with only a few years left until retirement anyway, and since game development often takes many years, I felt a stronger desire to move forward at my own pace, doing more freely creative things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shinji Watanabe, another ex-Nintendo employee and now CEO of Epsilon Software, <a href="https://x.com/es_s_watanabe/status/1938131920317256011">responded to Imamura</a> and agreed, even describing developers at Nintendo as "celestial beings".</p>
<p>Imamura has certainly earned his place in the Nintendo Hall of Fame, however, having contributed to massive franchises such as Star Fox, <strong>F-Zero</strong>, and <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. He has since released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">Omega 6: The Triangle Stars</a> on Switch.</p>
