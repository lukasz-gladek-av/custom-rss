<p>No joke</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a>'s Joker has made surprise appearances in games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and now he's making his way to Blizzard's free-to-play hero shooter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/overwatch_2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The Season 18 trailer has gone live and it finishes with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a> theme along with a silhouette of Joker. Atlus has also acknowledged the collaboration, which will go live on <strong>26th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's some additional PR about the upcoming season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bigger battles and bolder strategies await in Season 18: Stadium Quick Play!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Stadium Quick Play is here with shorter match times, quicker Item economy, backfill support, and Cross Play! Dominate as Winston, Brigitte, and Pharah at season launch, and shake things up with Tracer when she arrives in Stadium during Mid-season.</p>
<p>We’re also bringing a brand new game mode to Stadium with Payload Race, 3 new maps, and the new Draft Mode which gives players a pre-match advantage, enabling smart counter-picks and better team coordination.</p>
<p>Make a splash with Wuyang, the prodigy from Wuxing University and our newest Support Hero. With a skillset built for tactical repositioning and team utility, Wuyang rewards players who thrive on timing, precision, and adaptability.</p>
<p>Over 50 new Perks are arriving at launch, with each Hero getting at least one new one! In addition to new Perks, Season 18 is also bringing a Competitive Rank Reset, allowing a fresh start for everyone.</p>
<p>And we’ve only just starched the surface! Look out for Sojourn’s brand-new Ultraviolet Sentinel Mythic Skin, the new Season 18 Premium Battle Pass, and so much more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows on from collaborations with series like <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> and <strong>One Punch Man</strong>. In more recent times, Blizzard has also teamed up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> to offer unique collaboration skins based on Capcom's fighting game roster.</p>
<p>When we hear more about this latest crossover, we'll share an update. For now, you can see the latest season trailer in the video above. And in case you missed it, Atlus will also be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> to the Switch 2 on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>It's been announced another racing game is speeding onto the Switch 2 in the future. This time it's <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gear-club-unlimited-3">Gear.Club Unlimited 3</a></strong> and it's arriving at some point in "<strong>late 2025</strong>".</p>
<p>This game will follow on from the first two titles, which were released on the eShop during the original Switch generation. Apart from the teaser trailer above, Nacon has also shared some information about what you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Racing onto Switch 2 this November</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sakurai <em>finally</em> gave us our first proper look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> gameplay earlier this week, and based on what we've seen (and played) so far, it's not your average racing game.</p>
<p>If you want to know a bit more about what it's like, we've now put together this first impressions round up. We'll kick things off with thoughts from our video producer Felix Sanchez, who was able to go hands on with the title at Gamescom earlier this week:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's a lot we still haven't seen, but even this early on, there's so much variety... I had a really nice time racing with others and the controls feel extremely natural and easy to learn. Kirby is having a heck of a year on Switch 2"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/kirby/related-articles:186440 @ 1755845108 -->
<p>So what do other outlets have to say about this new entry? Here are some of the previews so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/kirby-air-riders-preview-impressions-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Polygon</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even though <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> has a reputation for being simple, it’s deceptively complicated. That holds true in a sequel that’s even heavier on visual stimuli. The pace is faster, there are tons of enemies to whack, and using a power-up usually results in a massive explosion of color on-screen. Machines swerve around the tracks with loose movement that makes them feel like mechanical bulls at times."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://mashable.com/article/kirby-air-riders-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"By the time the five minutes are up, you might have a machine that's so fast that you can barely control it, or so powerful that it's unstoppable in the more combat-focused Stadium minigames. No two City Trial games feel the same. It's a little magical."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview">IGN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kirby Air Riders is so extremely not just a Mario Kart redux that riding around 150cc matches at home felt practically quaint. Wall rides and bar grinds? That’s cute. In Kirby Air Riders, I’m drifting corners so screamin’ fast that I barely had time to blink. Whirlpool traps and gentle river runs? How serene. Air Riders’ Waveflow Waters race course has <em>violent</em> vortexes and corridors of walls made of water to punch through. Oh, and brace yourself for a gigantic meteor shower of fireballs that reign down during City Trials too!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://gamerant.com/kirby-air-riders-gameplay-city-trial-hands-on/">GameRant</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After over two decades, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feels like more than just a sequel or a revival of a cult classic. Rather, it's almost a full reinvention that refuses to be just another racing game. Air Ride scratches the competitive itch for anyone who loves speed and just wants to race, but it's City Trial that gives the sequel its unique identity, with a great deal of chaos and strategy that makes every match feel different. And then there's plenty of room for experimentation with all the different riders and machines to choose from."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Kirby Air Riders launches exclusively for the Switch 2 later this year on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. You can find out more about it in the Direct broadcast from earlier this week. We've also put together a round up of every announcement.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/kirby/related-articles:186684 @ 1755845108 -->
<p>What are your thoughts about Kirby Air Riders so far? Do you think you'll be adding it to your collection later this year?
