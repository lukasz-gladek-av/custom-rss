<p>If you're having trouble keeping up with the successive updates, the studio has now put out a handy blog post of the title's first month in the garden. This basically sums up the major updates and "what's bloomed" since the game's launch - detailing what the team has been able to fix, polish and improve. Here's the full rundown:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey Lawn Legends! It’s been almost a month since PvZ: Replanted sprouted onto your screens, and we’ve been busy tending the lawn ever since. At launch we had a few weeds, but thanks to your feedback, support, and unwavering sun-powered spirit, we’ve been able to polish, fix, and grow the game into a healthier, happier garden.</p>
<p>"To our defenders of the lawn - Thank you! Your support, love, and beleaf in Plants vs. Zombies means the world to us. You help this garden grow. And to those who are about to pick up the seed packets for the first time, we can’t wait to see your adventure bloom."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dynamic-audio-returns">Dynamic Audio Returns</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic Audio was unintentionally missing at launch due to a technical hiccup. But you let us know fast. With Patch 1.3.0, Dynamic Audio is officially back and behaving just as it should. Your lawns sound lively again!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="accessibility-options-plus-sun-magnet">Accessibility Options + Sun Magnet</h3>

</blockquote>
<ul>

<li><em>Slow Speed Mode</em></li>
<li><em>Disable Screen Shake</em></li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="saves-progress-andamp-achievement-fixes">Saves, Progress &amp; Achievement Fixes</h3>

<li><em>Progress saving improvements</em></li>
<li><em>Correct achievement triggers</em></li>
<li><em>Separate save files for I, Zombie and Vasebreaker</em></li>

<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-nes-and-game-boy-library-with-four-more-titles">return of multiple retro games today</a>, Nintendo has rolled out a new update for the Game Boy app on the Switch and Switch 2, bumping it up to Version 3.0.0.</p>
<p>Apart from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kid_icarus_of_myths_and_monsters">Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a>, this major update also comes with some cool new easter eggs. If you missed the boot screen of the Game Boy era featuring the 'Nintendo' logo (or 'Game Boy' one) and iconic sound, the good news is it's back!</p>
<p>It works <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-onlines-gba-app-has-been-updated-version-3-0-0">the same as it does on the GBA</a>. Once you've installed the update, boot up the app and hold the left analogue stick, and you'll see the original Game Boy start screen appear. What's also neat is it's different depending on your 'game screen' settings in the app's options menu.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iglonj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, you'll get whatever screen filter you've got the game screen set to: Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket or Game Boy Color.</p>

<p>One last thing, the sound when booting up the Game Boy - Nintendo Classics app has also been changed from the Game Boy boot up noise to a coin block sound from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a>. If you want to see the boot up of each screen in motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/txjFcpHTmN4">Vooks.net has shared a video</a>.</p>
<p>According to multiple player reports, this latest update has also added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/psa-you-can-now-remap-nintendo-classics-nes-and-game-boy-controls">ability to remap Game Boy controls</a> in this app. You can find the 'View/Change Controls' setting in the game options menu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>If you've been wondering what's next for the Switch Online's 'Nintendo Classics' service, the November update is now available.</p>
<p>This latest update includes NES and Game Boy titles, with a total of four more games added to the service today. On the NES, there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ninja_gaiden_ii_the_dark_sword_of_chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/battletoads">Battletoads</a>, and on the Game Boy, retro enthusiasts can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kid_icarus_of_myths_and_monsters">Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a>.</p>
<p>Switch Online's Nintendo Classics service for Japan has received the same four titles in this week's update. Here's the rundown of each game (via Nintendo's Japanese website):</p>
<h3><strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for family computers that was released in 1990. A year after Ryu Hayabusa defeated the Evil Demon King and prevented the resurrection of the evil god in the previous work "Ninja Gaiden". The man who was controlling the Evil Demon King behind the scenes, the Fierce Demon Emperor Ashtar, starts moving on his own. In this game, you can climb up and down after being held on to a wall, or attack by consuming ninjutsu power while holding on to a wall, increasing your freedom of action. In addition, the "Alter Ego Technique" appears, in which up to two alter egos appear that follow Ryu and attack at the same time as Ryu. By successfully guiding the alter ego, Ryu's attack range will be greatly expanded."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Battletoads</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for family computers that was released in 1991. Rush and Jitz, the strongest and most trained frog warriors in the Battle Toad, will defeat a host of enemy monsters, navigate through traps, and rescue Princess Angelica and her fellow Pimples from their rescue. Fight through all 12 stages with a variety of variations, including side-scrolling, vertical scrolling battle action, and high-speed action on air bikes and space boards, using techniques tailored to each stage."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The title is an action game released in 1991 in North America for the Game Boy (unreleased in Japan). A new mission given to the angel pit by the goddess Palutena is to fight the bosses in the three worlds and obtain the "Three Sacred Weapons". As you defeat enemies that stand in your way and jump to jump, the pit will travel through a vast world. In "Hades" and "Sky", where the tower is set, it moves upwards, and in "Earthly World", it moves horizontally. Inside the stage, there are various rooms, such as a shop where you can buy items and a room where you can train and get weapons."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Bionic Commando</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for the Game Boy that was released in 1992. The main character, "Rud Spencer", who is equipped with a gun in one hand and a special wire in the other, challenges the Dreise army to a battle. There are several types of guns, such as the Wide Range Rifle that shoots bullets in three directions and the powerful Grenade Launcher. And the elastic wire is essential for capturing the fortress. It exerts great power when moving, such as shrinking the hooked wire to climb to a high place or jumping with momentum like a pendulum. In the communication rooms in each area, you can talk to allies and eavesdrop on enemy conversations to obtain valuable information."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To access these titles, you'll need to have an active base-tier Switch Online subscription. This update for the Nintendo Classics library follows the arrival of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> for the GameCube app in October.</p>
