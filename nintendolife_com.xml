<p>Capcom has done it again</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has done a great job with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but if you're still debating about it and the PlayStation 5 release, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://youtu.be/8izgK3xQHWY">shared a side-by-side comparison</a> of the game running on the Switch 2 and the PS5 Pro, and as you can see, the wizards behind other Switch 2 ports such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> have done it again!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/dlss-is-the-game-changer-for-resident-evil-requiems-impressive-switch-2-port?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Digital Foundry</a> mentioned in its own technical analysis, the Switch 2 is running a low internal resolution in docked but this version and the PS5 release actually end up comparing "fairly equivocally", and it's all thanks to DLSS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Foundry:</strong> On paper, a 540p image blown up to 1080p on a modern flat panel display doesn't sound great. However, DLSS looks surprisingly competitive. Fine detail like wires and fences can actually appear more temporally stable on Switch 2, while PS5's spatial upscaling solution (likely FSR1 or similar) looks noisier and less refined in motion. PS5 still wins overall on clarity, aided by its higher internal resolution and 4K UI (Switch 2 uses a 1080p UI), but the gap is much narrower than raw pixel counts would suggest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of cutbacks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-analysis-of-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-capcom-deserves-kudos-for-this-port">as previously noted</a>, geometry is pared back in the Switch 2 version and there are lower-quality textures. Capcom has also taken a "different" approach to the character hair design on Nintendo's new hardware, but overall it's a solid effort.</p>

<p>Game Freak is moving on from the original Switch hardware</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="8367be104bdbb"><a title="Pokémon Winds And Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8367be104bdbb/pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 generation last year, certain first-party titles have received cross-platform releases. Trainers saw this with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but this won't be the case for the new mainline entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, The Pokémon Company has clearly stated in official press materials and the new webpage how these next-generation entries developed by Game Freak are "exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2". In other words, Nintendo's existing hybrid platform isn't part of the plans.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fhynsik&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a glance, this new generation is already looking quite promising, and Game Freak potentially has over a year to polish the experience, with the titles currently scheduled for a 2027 release.</p>
<p>So, this means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> and Legends: Z-A are likely the last "major" new entries that will be released on Nintendo's original Switch hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo previously said it would continue supporting the original Switch as long as there's an audience, but also understands "exclusive games are crucial when launching new hardware" and intends to shift support to its new hybrid system as the fan base grows.</p>

<p>Watch your language, trainers</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="27101ee173e6e"><a title="Pokémon FireRed Version" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27101ee173e6e/pokemon-firered-version.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the joys for many trainers during the earlier generations of Pokémon was giving the main character and their rival a rude or downright inappropriate name. In the Switch eShop versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a>, it seems there have been some updates to this.</p>
<p>As reported by Kotaku, you'll either have to get <em>really</em> creative now, or there's a good chance the game will override whatever you've input and instead give you a generic name. Here's a sample of some of the words that won't fly:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fhynsik&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Kotaku</em> has verified that some words, such as “d**k,” “p***y,” “s**t,” and even the f-slur are replaced by names like “Gary” or “Janne.” This doesn’t seem to extend to some milder words, however, as “hell” and “damn” were not replaced."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This update appears to impact Pokémon names as well. One theory suggests the update is to prevent users from flooding social media with screenshots and footage containing offensive language. It could also potentially be linked to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a>. Either way, some names wouldn't be the best look, as Pokémon is intended to be a friendly experience for all ages.</p>
<p>As many trainers have highlighted, this confirms these classic Game Boy Advance releases have actually been edited for this special release. There have also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-version-gives-you-the-mystic-ticket-and-aurora-ticket">some other updates...</a></p>

<p>Well, Nintendo kindly sent one over to Nintendo Life Towers and we can confirm that it is indeed a Switch 2 Pro Controller — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a pad we absolutely love</a> — now with some pleasantly subtle RE-detailing. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Back in the day, sure, we were <em>all about</em> the gorily OTT RE chainsaw controller for GameCube, but two decades on? We're a little more sophisticated than we used to be, perhaps. We don't <em>need</em> blood splatter over every prong of our pad, and this new one could sit on the side quite comfortably without alarming pets or family members.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at those little details, courtesy of our lovely video chap Alex, shall we? First, some close-ups, then a handful of moody shots that may well have been snapped in a Raccoon City warehouse! Or possibly Alex's garage:</p>


<p>Tasty, no? Itchy, right?...</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing how it compares to the regular Pro Controller colour-wise (it <em>is</em> a little different), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjhZXoQ8OhI">check out Alex's short below</a>, and our review of the non-Evil version.</p>
<p><em>Let us know below if you've picked up one of these pads.</em></p>
