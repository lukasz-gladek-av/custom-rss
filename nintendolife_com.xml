<p>Pre-order bonus revealed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has today opened up pre-orders for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, and there's a teaser of some additional side story DLC coming our way later in 2026.</p>
<p>The new trailer (above) finishes with a brief look at everything included in the game's 'Deluxe' and 'Premium Deluxe' Edition packages. It's mainly bonus armour and hair customisations, but there's also that 'Side Story: Rudy' mention to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It's a little vague, but here's the official summary of this DLC from the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/stories3/en-uk/">Twisted Reflection website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A side story about Rudy, whose family have served as Azurian Royal Palicoes for generations.<br>
One day, while accompanying the protagonist on a survey of some egg quartz, Rudy makes a surprising discovery!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That tells us... not a lot, honestly. The additional side story is expected to launch in Autumn 2026, so we're sure we'll hear a little more about the bonus in the coming months — the base game itself doesn't launch until <strong>13th March</strong>, let's not forget.</p>
<p>We know that the Rudy bonus is included as standard in the Deluxe and Premium Deluxe editions (the former of which is now available to pre-order on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Monster-Hunter-Stories-3-Twisted-Reflection-2951637.html#Deluxe_Edition">EU eShop</a> for £74.99), but Capcom is yet to reveal any info on purchasing the DLC separately.</p>
<p>Either way, keep an eye on those storefronts, because Twisted Reflections pre-orders are starting to roll out.</p>

<p>Shovel Knight arrives in both NecroDancer games soon</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It is a truth, universally acknowledged, that at some point in an indie game's lifecycle, it will be graced by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> crossover. That even applies if your indie game is a decade old, it seems.</p>
<p>Brace Yourself Games has announced that 2015's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a> (which arrived on Switch a few years later) is getting a Shovel Knight DLC all of its own. The new package throws the indie icon into the roguelike rhythm game as a new playable character with his own moveset, weapons, and shortcut potentials.</p>
<p>The above trailer gives a taste of the DLC in action, but it's safe to say that seeing a pixel art Shovel Knight hopping around on his little spade still brings us unrivalled amounts of joy.</p>
<p>What you'll also notice from the above trailer is that Crypt of the NecroDancer isn't alone in this shovel-y expansion. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> is also getting in on the DLC fun, with a new Shovel Knight pack adding the following tracks to the rhythm game:</p>
<ul>
<li>"La Danse Macabre (Lich Yard)"<br></li>
<li>"Strike the Earth! (Plains of Passage)"<br></li>
<li>"In the Halls of the Usurper (Pridemoor Keep)"<br></li>
<li>"High Above the Land (The Flying Machine)"<br></li>
<li>"An Underlying Problem (The Lost City)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Rift is even getting Jake Kaufman's main Shovel Knight theme as an added bonus <em>for free</em>, so everyone will be able to try that one out.</p>
<p>The bad news is that we don't have a specific Switch release date for either of these yet. Both DLC bundles arrived on Steam yesterday, but the most Brace Yourself Games have confirmed so far is that the Switch version will be coming "at a later date". We'll be keeping an eye out for more information in the coming weeks, because we're really digging this DLC so far.</p>
