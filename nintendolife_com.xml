<p>Nintendo's new mobile service for Hyrule</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> on the Switch 2, Nintendo added a special service to its mobile app called <strong>Zelda Notes</strong> – giving players multiple features to enhance their time in Hyrule.</p>
<p>This service includes navigation assistance, voice memories, autobuild sharing, item sharing, and much more. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, we couldn't help but feel a lot of these useful features should have been implemented in-game, but it's now got us wondering how everyone else is finding this optional extra a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Are you still using it? Have you used this service at all? Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments. It's worth noting this app is exclusive to the Switch 2 editions of these games and doesn't require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use.</p>

<p>Nintendo has also been doing a lot behind the scenes over the past few weeks to update many of its major first-party Switch titles for the Switch 2. This includes both free and paid upgrades for select titles, and alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update, Nintendo has also rolled out a patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>This bumps the latest version of the game up to Version 2.0.0 and follows on from an update released in November last year.

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b8f150bd4881b/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're now well into the first month of the Switch 2 and Nintendo has today released a new software update for the system-exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>On face value, this patch includes multiple fixes tied to "issues" with items, game crashes, online play problems and more. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World - Ver. 1.1.1 (Released June 17, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where items were no longer able to be used.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when selecting a character and trying to start Free Roam from the “Free Roam” map.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down when watching replay after a race.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down after a race in “Online Play.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Knockout Tour” and “Online Play.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it was easy for a communication error to occur when trying to join Friends playing “VS Race” or “Battle” in “Online Play.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes slipped through the wall before the finish line of “DK Spaceport.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes couldn’t return to correct position after falling of the course between “Airship Fortress” and “Bowser’s Castle” while gliding.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you want to keep enjoying modes like Knockout Tour, you'll need to update your copy of Mario Kart World to this latest version before going online. You can manually install this update by pressing the plus or minus button on the software from the Switch 2 Home menu and selecting "software update". Alternatively, you can simply boot the game and you should be prompted to update.</p>
<p>This follows on from the release of Version 1.1.1 at launch, which enabled various features for the game and also made some other changes. You can find out more about this patch in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mario-kart-world-update-is-out-now-here-are-the-patch-notes">our previous post</a> here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>"I'm using tilt controls"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0685f59b6039e/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> includes all sorts of toggles making it accessible to everyone. However, it seems this has also led to some confusion – with some players questioning why their karts are moving on their own during races.</p>
<p>It's actually resulted in Nintendo's Japanese customer support account on social media now issuing a notice about assist features like auto-acceleration and gyro being enabled. There are a few other features in the options that first-time players might also want to disable. Here's the translated message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Support:</strong> "We have received inquiries from customers who play Mario Kart World stating that their karts move on their own during races. This phenomenon may be caused by features such as Steering Assist, Auto Acceleration, and Gyro being enabled. Change the settings for each feature as necessary."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To change these controls, you'll need to enter a game mode (or the free roam mode from the main menu), pause the game, navigate to the "settings" with the 'X' button, and from there you can toggle various features on or off. This includes smart steering, auto-acceleration, tilt controls (which make use of the controller gyro feature) and there is even an "auto-use item" option, which you'll want to make sure is switched off.</p>
<p>While these are always welcome features and make the series a lot more accessible to newcomers and younger audiences, we're sure Mario Kart veterans will want full control of the new Switch 2 exclusive, so it's advisable to toggle everything off.</p>
