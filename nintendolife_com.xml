<p>And it's out now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you thought the day's surprises were over, think again, as Bethesda, id Software, and retro specialists Nightdive Studios have announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, the "definitive re-release" of two classic spell shooters. Oh, and it's also out <em>right now</em> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/heretic-hexen-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>For just $14.99 (it's not up on the EU eShop at the time of writing this), you'll be able to pick up two of Raven Software's iconic first-person shooters which introduced inventory systems, vertical aiming, and character classes to the genre.</p>
<p>Heretic originally launched in 1994 on PC and was made in the DOOM engine; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hexen">Hexen</a> is a direct sequel that followed in 1995 and got a Nintendo 64 release in North America in 1997.</p>
<p>This release bundles together all of the games' content — <strong>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders</strong>, <strong>Hexen: Beyond Heretic</strong>, and <strong>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</strong> — plus two new episodes created by Nightdive and id Software: <strong>Heretic: Faith Renewed</strong> and <strong>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</strong>.</p>
<p>But, given that it's Nightdive at the helm, you probably want to see all the shiny new enhancements, right? Here they are (from the eShop page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong><br>
• Online cross-platform and local split-screen deathmatch and co-op modes<br>
• Toggleable enhanced soundtrack from Andrew Hulshult<br>
• In-game mod support (Nintendo Switch™ only supports featured mods, curated by the team at id.)<br>
• An array of accessibility options, quality-of-life improvements, and engine fixes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nightdive Studios just continue to keep impressing — we've only <em>just</em> got our mitts on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, so it looks like we'll be dipping into Nightdive's seemingly endless pool of retro rereleases once again.</p>
