And Nintendo is adding to the festive savings with is Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle in the UK.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fnintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-P00154" rel="sponsored noopener">official Nintendo website</a>, if you order the Switch 2 bundle, you'll get a Nintendo Switch Online 12-Month Individual Membership <em>and</em> a Luigi ornament for your Christmas tree — or shelf — for free.
