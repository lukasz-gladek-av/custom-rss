They are a weird-looking group of creatures, to say the least, heralding from the 'Ultra Space' dimension, and thus appeared rather different when compared to the general squishiness of most other Pokémon designs. Well, according to former Game Freak illustrator Yusuke Omura — who served as Sun and Moon's lead Pokémon designer — that was kinda the point (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemons-ultra-beasts-were-based-on-past-pokemon-designs-rejected-by-game-freak-art-director-ken-sugimori-artist-reveals-thats-why-they-look-so-creepy/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Riffing on a recent <a href="https://x.com/ruruvi/status/2018614241524408698">X</a> theory about the Beasts' design origins, Omura <a href="https://x.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430">explained</a> that the Ultra Beasts' unusual look stems from many of his previous Pokémon proposals, which were rejected at the time by then-lead artist Ken Sugimori. Apparently, the traits that led to these past rejections served as the backbone for the Ultra Beast look, with the creatures' disturbing appearances acting like "a manifestation of [Omura's] own resentment".</p><div><figure data-videoid="EQ1L7whl5uA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ1L7whl5uA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytEQ1L7whl5uA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EQ1L7whl5uA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ1L7whl5uA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e741tgysvl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, there's no hard feelings between Omura and Sugimori, the post later clarifies, but it's interesting to hear how the director's vetoes eventually served to create something that felt intentionally un-Pokémon.</p>
<p>Here's Omura's <a href="https://x.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430">full post</a>, translated by Automaton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I designed the Ultra Beasts by recalling some of the designs I made which were rejected by Mr. Sugimori, and I decided to deliberately use the very reasons for why they were rejected and base the artistic direction of the designs on them. So in some way, they’re like a manifestation of my own resentment– pretty scary.</em><em>Of course, this doesn’t mean that I hate Mr. Sugimori or anything like that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the design work was completed on Sun and Moon, Sugimori apparently joked with Omura that there were some Pokémon designs in there that he wouldn't have used — <em>oops</em>!</p>
<p>So, there you have it. If you have ever been confused by Buzzwole's bee buffness, Xurkitree's long fingers, or Guzzlord's... well, <em>all</em> of Guzzlord, then it likely stems from a previously-rejected design coming back with a vengeance.</p>

<p>Howdy, partners!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="ea95192144bd1"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ea95192144bd1/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, we had an inkling that it might be on the horizon, and Nintendo has just made it official. A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has been announced for <strong>Thursday, 5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The Direct will kick off at <strong>2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 6am PT</strong>, and it promises "roughly 30 minutes" of news and announcements for third-party games heading to Switch 2 and Switch 1. As ever, you'll be able to watch along on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a>, your regional variant, or on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>
<p>Here's when the Direct will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Fri) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As for what the showcase will contain, your guess is as good as ours! There are still some third-party big hitters in the pipeline that we feel are probably due a new info dump — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> etc. — and we're still waiting on amiibo news for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>. Then again, it could be something completely new! Ports feel so much more possible on the new system, so we've got our fingers crossed for some sky-high dreams.</p>
