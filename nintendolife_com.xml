<p>It's a more "challenging production process"</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> to the Switch 2 in June 2026.</p>
<p>Compared to the first entry, part two is a significantly larger game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">small but intricately detailed open-world zones</a>. Despite this, the target goal apparently remains the same, according to the trilogy's director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/we-ask-final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-naoki-hamaguchi-about-the-switch-2-versions-hair-problem-why-does-it-happen-and-can-it-be-avoided/">Automaton</a> recently, he mentioned how the team's engineers are targeting 30fps "wherever possible". This will apply to not only Rebirth, but also the third installment in the trilogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> "We’re consistently aiming for 30fps wherever possible. For FFVII Rebirth and the third installment of the trilogy, our engineers are working hard on tuning to ensure stable performance at that level. I hope players will look forward to it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamaguchi adds how the team is working hard to optimise the game so it can maintain a "stable frame rate", while also improving the visual quality "as much as possible" at the same time.</p>

<p>This follows some comments Hamaguchi made not long ago, when he acknowledged how the second game was a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">much more "challenging production process"</a> overall but was still confident his team of engineers would be "able to deliver".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has also confirmed both titles to follow the Remake will feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">"exactly the same" gameplay experience</a> as other platforms.</p>
<p>When Rebirth arrived on the PlayStation 5 in 2024, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> thought it was a "great" sequel, but did call out the "disappointing" performance mode on this platform at the time, which <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/03/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-getting-another-patch-to-improve-performance-mode">led to a post-launch update</a>. As for our time with Remake on Switch 2, we thought it was an excellent experience, even at 30fps and with "a few minor dips" in handheld.</p>
