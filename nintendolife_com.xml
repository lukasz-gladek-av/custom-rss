<figure data-uuid="a0844111deb84"><a title="Pokemon Gen 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0844111deb84/pokemon-gen-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>On 27th February, Pokémon turns 30. That's three whole decades of exploring many and various regions to find monsters, battle monsters, and pocket monsters - and we've all got our personal favourites.</p>
<p>And they're not <em>always</em> just our starter, either! Sure, you build up a special relationship with your first Pokémon each generation, but there are usually a half-dozen winners who work their way into your good books as well as your team - and maybe even your <em>heart</em>, assuming you're not a cold Rock-type (and they can be awesome, too!).</p>
<p>In honour of this momentous anniversary, we'll be running a series of polls leading up to the big day where we get your votes for your favourite Pokémon from each generation. Then, we'll pit the winners against each other in a final nine-generation showdown to find out Nintendo Life readers' very favourite Pokémon from the <del>7 million</del> 1,025 discovered thus far.</p>
<p>We'll be covering a generation every day for the next nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown between the top 'mons at the end of the month. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days after going live.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/02/feature_best_pokemon_starters_from_all_gens_as_voted_by_you">We've looked at starters before</a>, and they're bound to poll well. We hear <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/03/random_new_study_uncovers_the_most_popular_pokemon_by_country">Pikachu's pretty popular</a>, too?</p>
<p>While the choice is yours and we certainly don't wish to influence your decision, we feel a duty to remind you of some less obvious picks from each gen. So let's quickly ask Team NL for some underdog candidates they'll consider before casting their vote. Team?</p>




<hr>
<p>Okay, that's more than enough ado - here's the poll featuring all 151 Gen 1 Pokémon in National Dex order. Remember, you can only choose one, so pick wisely!</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Keep an eye out for further generations in the coming days as we cruise towards Pokémon's 30th anniversary at the end of February!</em></p>
