<p>Launching in Japan next month</p>

<figure data-uuid="c9f951f7c1376"><a title="Sakurai Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c9f951f7c1376/sakurai-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506461">East Press / Famitsu</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>After <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> streams, Direct presentations and more YouTube uploads than we can count, we'd wager that you probably have a pretty good understanding of who Masahiro Sakurai is by this point. But seeing his life story told through a manga? Now that's new (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-manga-based-on-the-life-of-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-is-out-next-month/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55235">Famitsu</a> has revealed that the legendary creator of <strong>Kirby</strong> and Smash will soon have his very own manga biography, titled "Masahiro Sakurai: Making the World More Fun with Games' (via Google Translate). The book, on which Sakurai has lent a helping hand, traces his life from a childhood passion for gaming, through the creation of Kirby and Sora, and up to the present day. There's even a conclusion that Sakurai himself appears to have written.</p>
<p>According to Famitsu, the manga's six chapters are titled as follows (again, via Translate):</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: "Boy Sakurai and Games"</li>
<li>Chapter 2: "The Birth of Kirby of the Stars!"</li>
<li>Chapter 3: "The Beginning of the Great Battle"</li>
<li>Chapter 4: "Sora Limited Company Established!"</li>
<li>Chapter 5: "Inheritance"</li>
<li>Chapter 6: "A Light for the Future"</li>
</ul>
<p>The book will launch in Japan on 18th November for 1,430 yen (roughly £7 / $9), and while an English translation hasn't been announced at the time of writing, Famitsu has revealed a peek at the following three pages:</p>

<p>Sakurai's YouTube channel provided us with an unparalleled look into the developer's mind, so we're not exactly sure what else there is to know. That said, a manga biography wouldn't have made our bingo card any time soon, so it sure is a cool announcement.</p>
<p>The next time we see Sakurai will likely be in his second <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct, which was teased last month. The pink puffball's upcoming racer arrives on Switch 2 on 20th November, so there's only so many weeks left for another info dump from Sakurai himself. Keep those eyes peeled for a Direct announcement!</p>

<p>But you have to beat it first</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> already looks incredible, but a new trailer from IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 showcases the awesome feature in which you can actually change key moments from the original story.</p>
<p>You need to beat the game once first, during which you'll experience the story from Judgement Day in its entirety, but once you've done that, you're free to mix things up. Doing so will actually open up new levels and opportunities, so for example, instead of sparing the police that show up at Cyberdyne, you can eviscerate them with a mini-gun. Brutal.</p>
<p>There's also a short clip in which the T-1000 impales Sarah Connor, which is obviously quite a departure from how the original movie plays out. We can't wait to what kind of opportunities this might open up for the rest of the story.</p>
<p>As long as it's executed well and it's not, y'know... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a>, then we're all good.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate recently suffered a delay, but is still scheduled to launch this year on <strong>26th November 2025</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Switch 2's First Warhammer 40,000 Game Isn't The One You Might Expect]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/switch-2s-first-warhammer-40000-game-isnt-the-one-you-might-expect</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2s-first-warhammer-40-000-game-isnt-the-one-you-might-expect.1326340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 1 was home to plenty of <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> titles, so it was only a matter of time before Switch 2 got in on the fun. Well, that time is finally upon us, and the first series title on the new hardware is... the classic RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>! Wait, that's not <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine II</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, there was a part of us that expected to see the immensely popular 2024 shooter as the one to lead the 40k charge on Switch 2, but it looks like we're going for something different.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a story-rich RPG, where you'll explore the outer space perils of the Koronus Expanse. It boasts all the hallmarks of the genre, with crew-building, tough decisions that have a real effect on the story, and classic isometric turn-based battling. What's more, it seems to do them really rather well.</p>
<p>The game launched on PC, PlayStation and Xbox at the end of 2023 and, while this writer hasn't sampled it himself, it has gone on to rack up almost 15,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">Steam</a>. That's not bad going!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore the Koronus Expanse</strong><br>
Begin your adventure aboard your personal, giant voidship, traveling between the multitude of systems within the Koronus Expanse, a barely charted and incredibly perilous region of space. Despite being considered a backwater of the Imperium, this region encompasses an enormous stretch of the void, filled with dangerous creatures and prodigious opportunities for profit and exploration.<br>
<strong>Gather your Crew<br></strong>Rogue Traders never travel alone. Gather your retinue of righteous heroes, twisted psykers, and perfidious xenos. All of them are ready to follow you into the darkness between the stars. They will offer you counsel, aid you in battle, and allow you to amass ever more power. In return, you can guide them through their own personal journeys, changing their destinies forever.<br>
<strong>Your Decisions Matter<br></strong>During quests show your subjects mercy or disdain, stay faithful to the God-Emperor, or consort with enemies of Mankind - your every decision and every act, even in character creation, is changing the in-game open world and those who inhabit it.<br>
<strong>Plan your Actions Carefully</strong><br>
Slaughter the enemies of Mankind in a fully-fledged isometric turn-based tactical combat. Take advantage of cover, the environment, and careful positioning to overpower your enemies. When that is not enough - use your companion`s powerful abilities to turn the tide of battle and achieve victory even in the direst of situations. Our video game adaption of the classic Rogue Trader ruleset allows an enormous number of possibilities for you to explore.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>OwlCat hasn't provided a specific release date for this one just yet outside of the teasing "coming soon", but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more info.</p>
