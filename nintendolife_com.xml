<p>Mario &amp; Wario, Bubsy and Fatal Fury Special!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's latest batch of Switch Online SNES games has dropped, and for October three games have been added.</p>
<p>Following his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Purrfect Collection</a> release in September, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bubsy_in_claws_encounters_of_the_furred_kind">Bubsy</a> is now back with Accolade's original 1993 Super Nintendo side-scroller. Along with this, we've got the release of the 1994/95 SNK fighting game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a>. It follows on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_2">Fatal Fury 2</a> on the service in January.</p>
<p>And last but not least is Game Freak's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_and_wario">Mario &amp; Wario</a>. This puzzle-platform title by the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a></strong> developer made its debut on the Super Famicom in 1993, and this marks the first time it's been made available outside of Japan. One catch is, you'll need to use your Joy-Con 2 to play this game (or a USB mouse on the Switch).</p>
<p>Here's the official Nintendo description for each game, along with some screenshots <em>[Update: Feel free to rate each game in our polls, too!]</em>:</p>
<h3><strong>Mario &amp; Wario</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Action puzzles abound in this title released only in Japan for the Super Famicom™ system in 1993. Wario has dropped a bucket on poor Mario's head, and now he can't see! So it's up to you to lead Mario safely to Luigi. Use the forest fairy's magic wand to create platforms, change the direction Mario walks, and defeat enemies. You can clear a total of 100 screens full of unique challenges using simple controls—just move the mouse to move the fairy and click the left button once to perform actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>BUBSY™ in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bubsy the bobcat is on the prowl to recover his stolen yarn! Play as the furr-ocious feline himself in this action title released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System™ in 1993. Bubsy's grand adventure begins when his precious yarn is stolen by a race of yarn-obsessed aliens, the Woolies. Gallivant across 16 total stages, each containing an average of 300 screens, packed with wacky enemies and kooky mechanics. Dash through every nook and cranny of these vast stages as you search for yarn balls scattered throughout and make for the goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>FATAL FURY SPECIAL</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Pit 15 different fighters against each other! This fighting game, released for the Super NES™ console in 1995, includes the original eight characters from FATAL FURY 2, as well as three new characters (Billy Kane, Axel Hawk, and Laurence Blood) and a new boss (Wolfgang Krauser). Additionally, three characters from the original FATAL FURY (Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, and Geese Howard) have returned to the fight. By building on the appeal from the previous game with its two-line battles, special moves, and powerful finishers, on top of further improving the series's formula, this game is truly worthy of the title "SPECIAL." And if you can meet certain special conditions, Ryo Sakazaki from the ART OF FIGHTING series will make a special guest appearance, which is noteworthy in itself!</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The same three titles have also been released on the Super Famicom - Nintendo Classics service in Japan this month. Mouse support for the SNES digital collection arrived alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> release in July. Nintendo has added this control option for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-four-more-titles">other games on the service</a> as well.</p>

<p>It's already outpacing Switch and PS4</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella, Nintendo's new hybrid device sold 2.4 million units over its first three months on the market (from June to August), placing the system five percent ahead of the PlayStation 4's previous "record-setting pace", which shifted 2.2 million units within the same time frame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With 2.4M units sold LTD over its first 3 months market, Nintendo Switch 2 is now 5% ahead of the previous record setting pace of PlayStation 4, which sold 2.2M units during the 3 months ending January 2014."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4xzjrlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Piscatella further notes how these sales were able to offset "double-digit percentage declines" across the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Switch. It doesn't stop there, either – with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-sales-in-the-us-are-outpacing-the-original-console-by-75percent">Switch 2's unit sales trending</a> ahead of "time-aligned sales" of Nintendo's original hybrid unit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 unit sales are trending 77% ahead the time-aligned sales of the original Nintendo Switch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's financial results in August previously confirmed Switch 2 hardware sales had exceeded <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">"6 million units globally"</a> in the seven weeks after launch. It also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">shared a regional breakdown</a> of Switch 2 hardware sales for this period.</p>
<p>As for the best-selling games in the US in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> made the top 10, coming in at seventh place (down from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/donkey-kong-bananza-is-selling-like-bananas-on-switch-2-us">third spot in the previous month</a>). Although this placement does not factor in the game's digital sales.</p>
