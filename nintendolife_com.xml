            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/gloomy-eyes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-gloomy-eyes-switch-if-captain-toad-were-a-cosy-horror-game.1301331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Growing up, I absolutely loved <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/medievil">MediEvil</a> on the PS1. The spooky yet lighthearted aesthetic really spoke to me as a child and would ultimately help foster a lifelong passion for the horror genre. So when I saw trailers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gloomy_eyes">Gloomy Eyes</a> from developer Fishing Cactus, I was instantly enamoured with the Tim Burton-esque vibes.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Inside</a>, Gloomy Eyes is a puzzle-adventure that stars two characters, Nena and Gloomy, who begin an unlikely friendship. Described as "self co-op", the game is strictly single-player, but you’ll be swapping between the two protagonists on the fly in an effort to complete each level, while voiced narration provides context and backstory.</p>
<p>The levels themselves are presented as spooky dioramas, and a quick press of ‘-’ will bring the camera all the way out so you can scope out the entire environment. It reminds me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>, in a way, albeit with much larger levels and puzzles that often require a bit of backtracking. That’s a scary word for many, but each level here takes mere minutes to complete, even if you have to spend time traipsing around in confusion before figuring out what to do. It’s a breezy experience, one that can easily be polished off in just a few short hours.</p>
<p>Puzzles are pretty tactile in the sense that you're always interacting directly with the environment with objects found on the fly, and you’re often required to complete objectives with one character to open access for the other. Gloomy, for example, can’t stand the light, so you might need to shut off the power as Nena. Alternatively, Gloomy is adept at chucking rocks, so hurling one at certain lights knocks them in the other direction, freeing the way to proceed while blinding an enemy stalking Nena.</p>
<p>Exploring the environment, picking up items, and discovering how they interact with obstacles is satisfying, but it can often be quite tricky to make out certain details within the world. This is usually due to two key reasons: the fixed camera angle makes depth perception difficult, so you’re never quite sure whether certain pathways are actually accessible until you start venturing down them; and the game just looks a bit messy on the Switch.</p>
<p>The art design is wonderful, but the slightly blurry visuals and washed-out colours can look unpleasant at times. It’s a shame, because it looks a real treat on other platforms, so this is yet another instance of Switch players getting an objectively lesser experience. It doesn’t look much better on Switch 2 either, but it’s at least fully functional if you want to try it on Nintendo’s newer system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, disappointing visuals aside, there’s a lot to like here. It definitely falls into the ‘cosy horror’ sub-genre, with spooky yet charming aesthetics, haunting music, and engaging puzzle-solving throughout. With Halloween on the horizon, it could be the perfect little primer for younger gamers.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/gloomy-eyes]]></content:encoded>

<p>Multiple genres in one easy-to-store package</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="baroque YA collection announcement" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/85f54e2137f79/baroque-ya-collection-announcement.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sting</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japanese dev outfit Sting has just announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/baroque_ya">Baroque YA</a>, a collection of four games from the genre-spanning series, will release on Switch (in Japan only, for now) on <strong>18th December</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally released for the Sega Saturn all the way back in the Spice Girls-heady days of 1998, the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/baroque">Baroque</a> is a post-apocalyptic RPG in the roguelike vein that was eventually ported to Wii in 2008.</p>
<p>The game was then followed by a smattering of further entries, all of which are included in this new release, jumping genres from visual novel to platformer and shoot 'em up.</p>
<p>Here's the complete list of what's made the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BAROQUE: Original Version</strong></li>
<li><strong>BAROQUE Syndrome</strong></li>
<li><strong>BAROQUE Shooting: Reversed</strong></li>
<li><strong>BAROQUE ~Become a Meta-Being~ Revive</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure><a title="baroque YA collection announcement" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11ca8aa7c7bdc/baroque-ya-collection-announcement.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sting</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hopefully, at some point we'll see this collection make it over to the West. But for now the old tried and tested means of grabbing this from the Japan eShop (or importing from your purveyor of choice) will have to suffice for big fans who just can't hold out. We'll keep you posted with any further news.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to Baroque YA? Played any games in the series, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/baroque">the Wii version</a> or the original? Check out the trailer for that 2008 version below if you need a reminder.</em><em><br></em></p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza DLC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a6184125b5da8/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There is a lot to be distracted by in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a>. It might be the beautifully reimagined DK Island, the fast and frantic Emerald Rush mode or... actually, that's about it. But those are two pretty distracting things! Distracting enough, we'd say, for a sneaky Easter Egg to slip under the radar.</p>
<p>If you had asked us yesterday whether we spotted the Namco reference in the DKB DLC, then all you would have got in return is a blank stare — and that's with near enough 10 hours of Emerald Rush roguelike runs under our belts. But modding extraordinaire <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohpoorpup.bsky.social">Christa Lee</a> has opened our eyes. What's been seen cannot be unseen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4mvostu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Okay, let's cut to the chase. When you finish an Emerald Rush run, DK's VoidCo employee card pops up on screen so you can see all the rewards you've pulled in. But if you take a closer look at the platforming primate's employee number, you'll see a pretty recognisable series of digits (if you're a Pac-Man fan, that is): 7650.</p>

<p>For those <em>not</em> in the know, 7,650 is the maximum number of points you can pick up in a Pac-Man game. It's a recurring figure that cropped up in a bunch of Namco-developed titles, apparently due to the numbers' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_substitution_in_Japanese">gorowase</a> substitutions sounding like the company name (7='Na', 6='Mu', 5='Ko', 0='O').</p>
<p>Now, sure, its appearance in the Bananza DLC <em>could</em> be a complete coincidence, but we doubt it. Nintendo clearly has knowledge of it — remember the Wii U Smash Bros. '<a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/The_Big_7650!">The Big 7650!</a>' event? Yep, we forgot it too — so we think the employee number is a nice nod to the high-score-achievers and arcade originators of the past.</p>
<p>We have smashed our way through the DLC's interactive credits, and we saw no sign of Bandai Namco having done any work on it. Then again, the studio has paired up with Nintendo on various things in the past, so this isn't to say that the team had <em>no</em> sway over the roguelike add-on.</p>
<p>It's a neat little nod, and one that definitely would have passed us by had it not been pointed out to us (so that's for the heads up, Christa!). We had a good time with the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC, praising the fast and fun roguelike mode, but feeling a little short-changed by the rest of the experience. You can find our full thoughts in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">review</a> below.</p>

<p>Free blades if you've played TOTK or AoC</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It's not too long now until we finally get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> on Switch 2, with that <strong>2nd November</strong> release date rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>To sate our appetites in the interim, Nintendo has dropped a new teaser trailer showing off Koei Tecmo's very slick-looking Musou action featuring all of your favourite lunatics from the Zelda series. Oh, and Zelda herself, who is shown kicking seven shades out of huge armies in gameplay footage that, as a big Warriors franchise fan, this writer is incredibly excited about. It's all so smooth, so 60fps, so crystal clear and beautiful. Hold me, Tingle!</p>
<p>Now, beyond the excitement of finally getting a 60fps Musou game in the palm of our hands (and one that happens to look incredible, to boot), the trailer above also unveils some goodies to be nabbed for players who have a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and/or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> save on their system.</p>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom data nets you a <strong>High Guard's Sword</strong> to be used in the game, whereas Age of Calamity nets you a <strong>High Guard's Claymore</strong>. Nothing groundbreaking, but welcome nonetheless.</p>

<p>If November is too far away, remember that the previous entry in the Hyrule Warriors series is playable on Switch 2 with a much improved, now-stable frame rate - one of various games to get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/33-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">unnannounced, 'secret' updates</a> thanks to the newer hardware's grunt. If the frequent dips put you off on your Switch 1, now's a good time to catch up.</p>
<p>And if that's not enough Musou for you, remember that Koei Tecmo is bringing Omega Force's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> to Switch 2 in January, too. Plenty of hacking and/or slashing to be getting on with, then!</p>

<p>With a heavy discount for current owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> was a delightful little game from developer Shin'en Multimedia, and the company has now revealed that its official re-release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst: Deluxe</a>, will launch on the Switch 2 next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available now at <strong>19.99€ / $19.99</strong>, though current owners who purchased The Touryst from the Switch eShop can bag the re-release at a heavily discounted price of <strong>4.99€ / $4.99</strong>.</p>
<p>The game will run at 4K resolution with frame rate set at 60fps; it's worth mentioning here that the game already ran at 60fps on Switch, albeit at a max resolution of 1080p. 120fps won't be supported at launch, but this might be something Shin'en could explore at a later date.</p>
<p>Several other graphical enhancements have been applied, but players can also look forward to brand new content, including new locations and quests, and even a playable arcade spin-off of the <strong>FAST</strong> racing series.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at everything new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Resolution is now 4k (from 1080p) at 60fps<br>
- Added new locations, new items, new quest<br>
- Added new Arcade Cabinet (featuring FAST ZERO racing game)<br>
- Added Global Illumination for many locations<br>
- Added Voxel waves on the beach shores<br>
- Added dynamic Ambient Occlusion<br>
- Added Anti-Aliasing<br>
- Much improved Rain effect<br>
- Much improved Depth of Field effect<br>
- Improved controls<br>
- Import your save game from the Nintendo Switch 1 version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now let's see how The Touryst: Deluxe is shaping up, along with a couple of comparison shots with the Switch original:</p>


<p>Shin'en Multimedia also launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> as a launch title for the Switch 2 to critical acclaim, earning a well-deserved score of 9/10 from us. It's since received a free update to add more performance options and content.</p>
