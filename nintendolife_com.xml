<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/780e82d554eac/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> has secured a firm release date on Switch 1 and 2, and with the latter console being more powerful, fans should be excited for what will hopefully be a smoother, more-polished release for the latest entry in the Trails series.</p>
<p>However, ever since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">Switch 2 version's announcement back in June</a>, there's been controversy surrounding it as publisher NIS America confirmed it would be a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/never-in-my-wildest-dreams-would-i-have-expected-this-falcom-president-talks-20-years-of-trails-in-our-big-interview">after our interview with Falcom President Toshihiro Kondo</a> — where representatives of NIS America were present — we asked about why the publisher decided to go with a Game-Key Card release, rather than a full physical version.</p>
<p>In a follow-up email, a representative from NIS America responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We decided to release this title as a Game-Key Card on the Nintendo Switch 2 as we believed it was the most beneficial option for our customers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to clarify that, as far as we can tell, a Japanese Switch 2 release hasn't been confirmed for the game yet. As such, this 'physical' version is only confirmed for the West. Another Falcom game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> — which is currently <em>only</em> confirmed for Japan — is also a Game-Key Card release on Switch 2, though that is being handled by Clouded Leopard Entertainment</p>
<p>Regardless, the above response isn't the answer anyone was looking for, and many have taken to social media to criticise. Especially when the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon?variant=42117184127024">special edition of the Switch 2 release is $10 more expensive than any other version</a>, including the PS5 release.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon Switch 2 Special Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e119d950bc95/trails-beyond-the-horizon-switch-2-special-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Game-Key Card releases have gone down like a lead balloon in general, with many refusing to buy them as they're not true physical games — as Nintendo puts it, the cartridge in the box is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview">"your "key" to downloading the full game to your system via the internet".</a></p>
<p>You only need to connect to the internet the first time you boot up the game, but you will need to pop the Game-Key Card into the Switch 2 to play the game, despite the fact the game isn't on the cartridge.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version is a full physical, but we have no details on whether there will be the ability to transfer save data between the Switch 1 and 2 versions, <em>or</em> whether there will be an upgrade path for those who want to buy the physical Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>Some publishers, such as Marvelous and CD Projekt Red, have stuck to full physical releases, but many third-party Switch 2 games — like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, and even future releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a> — are all Game-Key Cards.</p>

<figure><a title="dk speedrunners" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7df75ab55e798/dk-speedrunners.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been absolutely addicted to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> over the past week or so and various members of the team are, as expected, at different points along the way in the adventure. Some, like this writer, are still fairly early on in DK's latest outing, whilst others, such as our very own Liam Doolan, are already done with the thing. No messing around there!</p>
<p>Now, very mild spoilers ahead, but by way of some of the old 'water-cooler' banter (proving once and for all that such a thing can even exist betwixt online colleagues), Liam shared with us that he'd actually managed to complete the game without unlocking one of Donkey Kong's transformations.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Further to this, he hasn't even completed one of the layers. He skipped the entire frozen area of the game. All that lovely snow!</p>
<p>After a quick look online, and it seems Nintendo Life's crack squad of pro gamers aren't the only ones finding lots of new ways to beat the game and/or skip things in the name of speedrunning. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m2ud1r/you_can_completely_skip_freezer_layer_and_zebra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">r/DonkeyKong</a>, people are already sharing Liam's trick, along with a whole bunch of other ways to beat the game quickly.</p>

<p>Some of these techniques can be a little spoilery, so take care.</p>
<p>The video below, meanwhile, gives an indication of the sorts of things gamers are already doing in terms of mechanics, rather than simply skipping things.</p>
<p>There's some real potential here, as this post exclaims, as the Bananza transformations can be freely switched between once engaged. As seen in the vid, entire areas can be avoided if you use the right moves at the right time.</p>

<p>Another post on the forum claims to have only unlocked two of the five total Bananza transformations in the game, so we can only imagine that there's plenty more shenanigans ahead in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>We're genuinely feeling quite tired just considering trying some of this stuff. Whatever happened to just taking your sweet time, y'know?</p>

<p>Coming January 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>NIS America has revealed that the next entry in the expansive turn-based RPG franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>15th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This announcement follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">game's delay just last month</a> from its Fall 2025 date, where the Switch 2 version — which is a Game Key-Card — was also revealed.</p>
<p>Taking place across the continent of Zemuria, Trails Beyond the Horizon is the third game in the Calvard Arc, and the 13th game in the wider Trails series. You'll control three different protagonists throughout the adventure — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak">Daybreak</a>'s lead Van Arkride, the founder of Arkride Solutions and a Spriggan; Rean Schwarzer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_iii">Cold Steel</a>'s protagonist and the Ashen Chevalier; and Kevin Graham, a high-ranking member of the Septian Church who hasn't been seen since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_to_azure">Trails to Azure</a>.</p>
<p>The game features a robust blend of turn-based and real-time combat, which legendary Japanese developer Nihon Falcom has been steadily improving over the course of the series. The game will be playable at PAX West later this year, so if you're heading there, keep an eye out for the booth!</p>
<p>Let's get a better rundown of what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Arkride and the members of Arkride Solutions are back, and this time the future of the entire Zemurian continent is at stake! The people of Zemuria await the launch of humanity's first foray into space with bated breath. A sudden invitation from Marduk to cooperate in a high-tech training exercise sets Van, Ashen Chevalier Rean Schwarzer, and Father Kevin Graham on a collision course with the secrets at the very core of Zemuria.</p>
<p>Their paths may diverge, but the ultimate question remains the same: Just what lies beyond the edge of the horizon?</p>
<p>● All Trails Lead Here: Paths from across Zemuria intertwine with higher stakes than ever before as the Trails series enters its final chapter!<br>
● Gameplay, Evolved: New gameplay mechanics such as Shard Commands,<br>
Awakening, and the time-freezing Z.O.C. give you an unprecedented amount of options in both Field and Command Battles!<br>
● Dream Teams: Gather allies from all over Calvard and beyond and put a stop to Ouroboros' machinations in the Grim Garten, a dungeon that you can take on with your own custom party!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's looking pretty fantastic, and will be an excellent way to ring in 2026 for RPG fans.</p>
