            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8773a64927b5"><a title="The Seance of Blake Manor" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8773a64927b5/the-seance-of-blake-manor.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spooky Doorway</em></figcaption></figure><p>Spooky Doorway is an Irish dev studio that's already brought us lucky Switch gamers some seriously good point-and-click fun times in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective_-_the_series_edition">The Darkside Detective</a> series.</p>
<p>This is a studio with form, and one that's already proven it knows how to serve up clever puzzle adventures that just <em>get</em> what makes this particular genre sing. I'm talking about delicious mysteries into which to sink your teeth, mysteries that are alive with all manner of supernatural and off-kilter aspects. Stories full of weirdo characters backed up by excellent writing, perfect location choices, and gameplay that gives you enough agency that you're sucked right into the whole thing for the duration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective">The Darkside Detective</a>, and its follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective_a_fumble_in_the_dark">A Fumble In The Dark</a>, excelled at all of this, and with sinister style to spare. So, you'll have to forgive me (and doubly so as an Irishman) if I've been ever so excited and delighted by the arrival of the team's latest game, <strong>The Séance of Blake Manor</strong>.</p>
<p>This point-and-click horror mystery is set in 1897s Ireland — Connemara to be precise — and it's their best work to date by some margin. It's a game that, had it released on Switch when it landed on PC back in October, would absolutely have been sat in the number one spot for me, over all of the other things — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-i-reviewed-25-switch-2-games-in-2025-and-these-are-my-top-3-picks">even all the Nintendo stuff (!)</a> — that I played in 2025. It's proper GOTY material, is what I'm saying, and I really, really, really (add lots more "reallys" here) want to see it come to Switch so all my Nintendo homies can get stuck into it too.</p>

<p>The titular Blake Manor is a hotel set in a remote spot in the west of Ireland, and if you've ever been to this part of the world, you'll know just how dramatic and how well lent to horror and mystery the scenery and wilderness is. Connemara is a wild and rugged spot, with its famous Twelve Pins, a range of Bens that can often be seen rising dramatically up and out of the ever-present mist of a morning - the same mist that settles over the area's many, many ancient bogs. Now add a great big Gothic hotel full of haunted stuff and weirdos, and we're in business.</p>
<p>It's the kind of place you want to set a nice big mystery like those snazzy ones with Daniel Craig in them, except make it tinged with cosmic horror and supernatural elements. It's also a setting that Spooky Doorway excels at manipulating into a story and set of puzzles that had me (a professional point-and-click expert, no less) glued to my PC monitor for the duration of my roughly 30-hour playthrough.</p>
<p>Assuming the role of Private Investigator, Declan Ward, you arrive at Blake Manor to investigate the disappearance of a young lady guest. It's a disappearance that's made all the more unsettling by the odd behaviour of the staff of the hotel, as well as its owner, and to add to the fun, a bunch of veteran mystics have just shown up to perform a weird Hallows' Eve ritual seance - so you're guaranteed a lot of strange conversations from the get-go.</p>
<p>It really is a delicious setup, and it's one that's carried off with aplomb, thankfully. I won't ruin it, it'd be a crime, but through interviewing suspects, keeping track of paper trails, getting stuck into all that amazing "Mind Palace" Sherlock-Holmes-style guff, solving well-designed puzzles, and exploring the labyrinthian (and secret-filled) hotel itself, you're kept more than busy.</p>

<p>Then we have the double-cherry on top of this one, the real finishing touches, in the form of a clever time management mechanic that sees your days count down as you work, adding a real sense of urgency to the entire endeavour...<em>and</em> the fact that the whole thing takes place from a first-person perspective. Oh yes, it's a real treat to explore this game from such a personal vantage point, make no mistake, and Blake Manor is brought to life in a way that wouldn't have been possible had the devs stuck with a more classic view of the genre at hand.</p>
<p>If you're into your gothic Victorian paranormal mysteries, and if you like your games stuffed to the gills with kooky characters, this one's 100% for you. By the same token, if you enjoy (or also enjoy) a bit of the auld Irish folklore and mythology — we do good folklore and mythology — and most certainly if you're into grand mysteries in the classic detective style, well, you need to play this. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>And so, I've got my rosary beads out for the lot of us. I'm praying hard for a miracle, mammy. Let's get this cracker on Switch consoles ASAP, as I reckon it's exactly the sort of thing I want to sit on my couch and play. Mostly because my TV is upstairs and I'm scared of ghosts now. And people. And stairs.</p>
<p>I reached out to Spooky Door for any word on plans for a Switch console release. No word back yet. However, perhaps they're keeping it for a surprise. Yes, yes, that's it. A surprise! Just don't go scaring me with any sudden noises if and when the announcement does finally roll around. I'm already petrified over here.</p>

<figure data-uuid="40b937d3cbf81"><a title="Sephiroth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40b937d3cbf81/sephiroth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, you made it! The weekend is here again, which means it's time to get some all-important gaming done.</p>
<p>Before that though, let's quickly recap the week. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">big review</a> was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> on the Switch 2, and as expected, it's a bit of a banger. We also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">heard from director Naoki Hamaguchi</a> who confirmed that the upcoming two sequels will have "exactly the same" gameplay as other platforms.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-gets-a-free-switch-2-update-and-adds-dixie-kong">surprise update</a>, which added in a bunch of improvements along with playable Dixie Kong. We got more information about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>'s Switch 2 update, and had a bit to say about its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/random-mario-wonders-new-box-art-might-be-the-ugliest-switch-2-edition-cover-yet">ugly-as-heck box art</a>.</p>
<p>So let's see what we're all up to, hm?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:196554,196505 @ 1769262018 -->
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I'll be diving into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cult_of_the_lamb">Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven</a>, which I'm quite excited about, as it's a chance for me to finally go back and finish the game - which I love, but I got distracted!</p>
<p>Beyond this, I'll be picking away at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a>, which I'm also really enjoying, and making some time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, which I've yet to touch. Loads of great stuff. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and I know there's been a lot of talk recently about how good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy Remake</a> looks on the Switch 2, and how its closest visual competitor is probably <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but man... Outlaws looks <em>really good</em>, too. Please give it a shot, if you haven't already.</p>
<p>And as teased last week, I have indeed jumped back into Zelda with... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>! Wheeey. Y'know what, I'm really enjoying it this time too. I'm just going slow, enjoying the sights and sounds, and not really bothering with much story stuff yet.</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>How has another week gone by so quickly? My theme for this week was “cosy-grinding” as I spent most of it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing New Horizons</a> or revisiting an old (and somewhat janky) favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/my_time_at_portia">My Time at Portia</a>. I've been trying to work through my huge backlog and Portia is on the top of my list to finish. Saying that, it'll take me a while because it's one I tend to play in short bursts.</p>
<p>This weekend however, I'm hoping to change it up with the Final Fantasy VII remake!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was too buried in everything else in 2020 to give Final Fantasy VII Remake a fair shot, so I have been counting down the days until I can properly dive into it on Switch 2. I’ll finally be seeing what it’s all about this weekend after the demo got me sufficiently intrigued a few weeks back, so I expect this will be my WAYP entry for a few weeks going forward.</p>
<p>See you on the other side, and all that!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>A triple dose of indie gems to play this weekend: The critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a>, the visually-striking MIO: Memories In Orbit and the clever nostalgia inducing Cassete Boy. I believe I will be done with Wings! Remastered Edition soon since I’m already in 1918. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will live in my head for a long time to come, truly an amazing achievement. What all those folks in the two hour long staff roll credits managed to pull of something special. It is now on the same level as my other favourite entry: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a>. I also picked up <strong>Rumble Roses XX</strong> on Xbox 360, another system exclusive game I always wanted to give a go.</p>
<p>Game of the week is to no surprise Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It has been a long time since this came out on rival platforms and an even longer time since I played the original on it’s European PS1 release. In my advanced age I no longer properly recall the plot, but... level up the flower-selling girl while giving her all the best materia and gear and Sephiroth does nothing wrong… right?</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Would you believe it, ACNH has gone an got its claws in me again. Having avoided crafting as much as possible (and never having cooked a thing in the game), I've been getting back into the swing of things, making a few items, and customising some pieces for my house, specifically for my Ten Forward-themed top room, which now has some nice long windows looking out at the stars.</p>
<p>Since last week, my kids have tents in the game, too, and I'm introducing them to the controls. I expect we'll spend a couple of hours pottering around the island, while I spend thousands of Bells on the clothes they want in the Able Sisters' place. Time to plant some more money trees. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>! I think I will be playing it forever. I have two endings so far, and no actual end in sight. I love it so much.</p>
<p>When I'm done with that, some time next century, I'm gonna give <strong>TR-49</strong> a go! I think I must be one of Inkle's biggest fans at this point, and after playtesting their last one, I made sure to go in almost completely blind to this one. Excited!</p>

<p>Last November, Sega announced three more characters for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. This included the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> IDW duo, Tangle and Whisper.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent interview with <a href="https://mcvuk.com/">MCV Magazine</a>, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka has reiterated how the team realises there is "a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe" which goes beyond the video games, and is apparently open to including even more "deep cut characters if the opportunity feels right".</p>

<p>According to an update on his Facebook page, Konno seemingly left the company in July 2025, but the news of his departure and apparent retirement has only been discovered now. He was at Nintendo for around 40 years and started as a designer and assistant director on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>.</p>

He went on to lead his own group at <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Production_Group_No._9">Nintendo EPD</a> and played a role in the creation of the 3DS as the producer.</p>
<p>In more recent years, he acted as a producer on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, and helped run <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Smart_Device_Production_Group">Nintendo's mobile division</a>, working on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_heroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>. He also worked on the DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> for Switch and was recently given a "special thanks" credit in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
