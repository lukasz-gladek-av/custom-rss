<figure data-uuid="7a3b1bbf5dc96"><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a3b1bbf5dc96/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Zelda series in 2026, and this week it has released new updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p>These updates aren't major ones, but they do include some general fixes for both titles and there's now also Thai language support in Breath of the Wild. As usual, Nintendo says it's addressed several other issues across both games, so if anything else significant is discovered behind the scenes, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>For now, here's the full rundown of each update, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/61936/~/how-to-update-the-legend-of-zelda%3A-tears-of-the-kingdom">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Version 1.4.3</a> (Released 17th February 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue causing the Black Hinox in Hyrule Castle to appear as undefeated even after being defeated, preventing players from obtaining the Hinox Monster Medal. By downloading the update data, players will be able to obtain the Hinox Monster Medal.</em></li>
<li><em>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/25568/kw/breath%20of%20the%20wild%20update">Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Version 1.9.0</a> (17th February 2026)</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Added Thai as a supported language. If you set the language to “Thai/English” in the Nintendo Switch 2 system, the text will become Thai.</em>
<ul>
<li><em>The audio language does not support Thai, so if you select "Match System Settings" from the "Options" in the game, it will be in English.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Now might be a good time to revisit Skyrim</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="7d72872352d24"><a title="Skyrim" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d72872352d24/skyrim.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> didn't exactly arrive on the Switch 2 in the best state last year, but Bethesda has rolled out some patches since then to improve the overall experience.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this week sees the arrival of <strong>Update 1.2</strong> for the title on Switch 2. This includes a 60Hz mode, allowing players to prioritise either visuals or performance. The update also locks the frame rate at 30Hz when prioritising visuals, improves FPS drops in certain locations, and fixes a bunch of bugs, including Joy-Con 2 controller problems.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ox0NHxAh5v8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytox0NHxAh5v8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed78ab97tvmhwz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the full rundown, according to Bethesda's official patch notes (via social media):</p>
<h2><strong>Skyrim Switch 2 Update 1.2 Notes</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added a 60 Hz mode under Display settings that allows players to toggle between “Prioritize Visuals” or “Prioritize Performance”.</em></li>
<li><em>In addition, frame rate has been locked at 30 Hz in “Prioritize Visuals” mode for smoother gameplay.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crashes and Performance Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that occurred when reading “The Crimson Dirks Vol. 4” book for the “Tilted Scales” quest in German.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an audio-related crash.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash, infinite load, and game freeze that sometimes occurred when rapidly selecting “Load” multiple times in the pause menu.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that occurred when the “Transmute Ore” spell was repeatedly cast outside of the Haltered Stream Camp.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved FPS performance drops that occurred in the following locations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>during the Hide and Seek quest in Kynesgrove</em></li>
<li><em>during combat at Secunda’s Kiss</em></li>
<li><em>when discovering the “Drelas’ Cottage” location</em></li>
<li><em>when engaged in combat with a giant at the Talking Stone Camp.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visuals Issues Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Viewing water planes from a distance or within menus caused them to shift up and down.</em></li>
<li><em>Distant aspen trees appeared with a blue tint.</em></li>
<li><em>Transitioning out of caves caused an outline of the entrance to linger during the fade-to-back loading screen.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Interface Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in dialogue or the Help menu, caused different options to be highlighted.</em></li>
<li><em>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in help menus or user hints, did not dynamically update callout prompts.</em></li>
<li><em>The “Ready/Sheathe” option was missing from the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls menu.</em></li>
<li><em>The “Delete” prompt remained grayed-out within the Load menu when swapping between mouse and controller mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Deleting a save in the Save/Load menus reset the highlighted selection to the top of the menu list.</em></li>
<li><em>While in mouse mode, the cursor remained stuck within a smaller section of the screen when changing between docked/undocked modes or interfacing with GameChat.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controls Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The “Eagle Eye” Archery perk remained active after switching between mouse and controller mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Holding down the Right Joystick while reassigning a button caused that button to disappear from the Controls list.</em></li>
<li><em>The Joy-Con 2 controllers provided haptic feedback while in mouse mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Buttons became unresponsive when controls were remapped while moving the Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Rotating the map in mouse mode was slower and less smooth than in controller mode.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audio Issue Fix</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scrolling SFX continued to play while holding up or down on the Left Joystick or buttons at the top or bottom of the Save/Load menus.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Localization Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Amiibo” appeared as plural in Spanish.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added new translations for the features listed above and UI updates.</em></li>
<li><em>Updates were made to the game credits.</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This update follows the release of a patch towards the end of December 2025, which addressed input latency issues.</p>
<p>When we reviewed this title on Switch 2, we called it "hugely disappointing" - mentioning at the time how the whole experience was still running at 30fps and had "awful input lag to boot", so this is a welcome update today.</p>
