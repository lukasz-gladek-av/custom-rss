<p>Fancy a singing and talking Yoshi?</p>

<p>Nintendo's 'My Mario' campaign has lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e3127119-fdb6-43d2-ad95-e162068ea3df">multiple Yoshi-themed announcements</a> today, and apart from the new app, there'll also be a new singing and talking Yoshi released later this month.</p>
<p>This fluffy Yoshi, available on <strong>18th November 202</strong><strong>5</strong>, is a toy that will flap its arms, sway from side to side, talk and sing. It comes with 13 different voice lines and has two melodies: "Yoshi's Story" and "Yoshi's Song".</p>
<p>When you press the musical note on the bottom of Yoshi's foot, you can swap between the "talking mode" and "melody mode". Here's a look:</p>

<p>Apart from this, there'll also be a plush Yoshi, sitting Yoshi with a blanket, and Yoshi rattle released on the same date. All of these items can be hand-washed, making them easy to clean. And last but not least is a Yoshi board book releasing on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Once again, Nintendo has also announced a new Yoshi Switch and mobile app, as well as more standalone wood block amiibo sets.</p>

<p>Joining the 'My Mario' product line in Japan</p>

<p>When Nintendo kicked off its 'My Mario' campaign for parents and children in August, it also announced a new 'wood block' sets doubling as amiibo were on the way.</p>
<p>It's now revealed <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e3127119-fdb6-43d2-ad95-e162068ea3df">three more wood block sets</a>. This includes standalone three-piece sets for Yoshi, Peach and Luigi. This follows the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">a three-piece set for Mario</a> (priced at 2,980 yen) and a 30-piece set including every amiibo &amp; multiple blocks.</p>
<p>Here's a look at each of these three-piece sets:</p>
<figure data-uuid="21a505d4c5b67"><a title="Super Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/21a505d4c5b67/super-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>So, if you weren't interested in the bigger and more expensive set, it seems you'll be able to pick up each of these characters individually.</p>
<p>These standalone 'My Mario' wood block amiibo will be available at Nintendo Stores in Japan on <strong>18th November 2025</strong> - the same date as the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-announces-my-mario-yoshi-app-for-switch-and-mobile-devices">the new Yoshi app for Switch</a> and mobile devices.</p>

<p>If we hear about any details about a local release, we'll let you know.

<p>Following the release of 'Hello, Mario!' in August</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="aef29bb0b4aed"><a title="Yoshi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aef29bb0b4aed/yoshi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo announced a new 'My Mario' campaign for parents and children in August, which included a whole range of themed products as well as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-announces-new-hello-mario-app-for-switch-and-mobile-devices">Mario-themed smartphone and Switch app</a>.</p>
<p>In an update, the Japanese firm has now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e3127119-fdb6-43d2-ad95-e162068ea3df">announced a new Yoshi-themed app</a> for Switch and mobile devices. Like the Mario one, children will be able to interact with this particular character's face in all sorts of fun and interactive ways.</p>
<p>The app will be released for free on the Japanese Switch eShop on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>, and will also go live on the App Store and Google Play on the same date. Here's a rough translation about what you can expect, along with another look:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kipsuz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Stretch out Yoshi's tongue to eat items, or have different colored Yoshis appear from eggs. Have fun playing with this mysterious Yoshi, who shows off a variety of expressions.</p>
<p>"After playing for a while, Yoshi will fall asleep. You can't play while he's asleep, so use this as a guide for when your child is resting."</p>
</blockquote>

<figure data-uuid="b2af8bcee7761"><a title="Yoshi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b2af8bcee7761/yoshi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you didn't test out the original 'Hello, Mario' app, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/feature-nintendos-new-app-reminds-me-of-a-universal-truth-it-feels-good-to-squash-marios-face">we went hands on with it</a> here on Nintendo Life. Here's our own summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the most part, this is an interactive soundboard. Mario's ever-grinning face pops up in the middle of the screen, and you're free to squish and squash it in any way you please, all while he utters the general chorus of "<em>Ooh!</em>", "<em>Haa!</em>", and "<em>Wa-Haa!</em>" with every poke.</p>
<p>"...Nintendo couldn't resist adding a <em>little</em> bit of 'game' to the whole affair. Spinning Mario's face in a circle or firing him through a pipe (also accessed from the menu) brings up a little bubble-popping challenge, where you can tap the bubbles or drag Mario's face into them, each pushing a counter up towards 100. Nothing outside of a small confetti burst happens when you reach triple-digits, but it's <em>just</em> enough to hit every beat in that 3-5-year age bracket"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo has also announced a bunch of other Yoshi-themed products today as part of its ongoing 'My Mario' campaign. This includes toys, board books, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-reveals-three-more-super-mario-wood-block-amiibo-sets">standalone wooden block amiibo sets</a> for Yoshi, Peach and Luigi.</p>

<p>As the battle gets underway in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment</a> this week, it seems the team at Koei Tecmo's AAA Games Studio has already got some future updates planned.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/zelda_musou/status/1986357898071638423">Zelda Musou account on social media</a> has revealed how the developer is apparently gearing up to release two free updates in the future, which will allow fans of the new title to enjoy the experience "for even longer".</p>
<p>We don't have the specifics about these updates just yet, but we'll let you know when the details are revealed and they go live. This announcement follows the first patch for the new entry this week, which fixed some issues and also added a new shortcut feature to the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2xtugmn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>In case you missed it, there's also some bonus content you can unlock right now in Age of Imprisonment if you have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> save data. This includes the High Guard's Sword and the High Guard's Claymore. Here's another look:</p>

<p>If you've not yet decided whether or not to check this new entry out, be sure to check out our review. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</em></p>

<p>Over 100 jobs in the UK are potentially affected</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="73a8897453561"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Cloud" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/73a8897453561/final-fantasy-vii-remake-cloud.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Reports have emerged that Square Enix is the latest video game company to be hit with layoffs today, with job cuts across "nearly all areas" outside of Japan including roles in sales, marketing, and publishing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC broke the news</a> earlier today and reports that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu held a video call to staff outside of Japan — including Europe, the UK, and the US — to tell employees that a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization" will be taking place.</p>
<p>This will involve staff losing their jobs and those that remain will also be required to be present in the office more often. Employees are being told the news today, and staff have already shared posts on social media announcing their departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/square-enix-lays-off-staff-in-global-restructuring?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjQ1ODk3NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYzMDYzNzc0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUJMWDNHUEw0MjkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.8hIi4eIEjJGIFf5pODYhOL8-J_P1II2FnRzzFRYs6BY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> have also corroborated this information, with today's <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">progress report</a> stating that the restructuring "Implementation of structural reforms in overseas publishing organizations to further strengthen global publishing capabilities and improve operational efficiency".</p>
<p>According to the Progress Report (linked above), the Overseas Structural Reform is expected to save around 3 billion yen, or around USD $19.6 million.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Square Enix told both Bloomberg and IGN that the decision to make cuts and layoffs was "extremely difficult" though declined to tell the outlet how many jobs this will hit. According to IGN, around 137 jobs are potentially affected in the UK.</p>
<p>The company "extend[s] our heartfelt gratitude" to those affected and that "During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process."</p>
<p>This news follows the news <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-aims-to-automate-70percent-of-qa-with-generative-ai-by-2027">that Square Enix hopes</a> to "Automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027" using generative AI. Today's layoffs are reportedly unrelated to that announcement, as per <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4yebaj5jk2o">Jason Schreier on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>But it does come at a time when the video game industry is struggling, and over three years after Square Enix already sold off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/embracer-group-to-acquire-crystal-dynamics-square-enix-montreal-eidos-montreal-plus-ips-for-usd300-million">a number of its international development teams to Embrace Group</a>.</p>
<p>More details are sure to emerge; we wish for all the best for those impacted by today's layoffs.</p>
