<figure><a title="Coins" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1bca9c83ebf7/coins.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> lets you unlock a bevy of interesting new karts by collecting in-game coins. Specifically, you get one new kart for every 100 coins you collect; which is pretty much how it was on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>You'll need to grab a total of 3,000 coins to nab every in-game vehicle, which in standard play might take quite a while depending on how often you're able to dive in for a race. However, it seems some Mario Kart World players have found a pretty solid way to farm coins and unlock every kart pretty quickly.</p>
<p>We say "quickly", but it seems pretty tedious to us. Essentially, there's a vehicle driving around the world that constantly spits coins out of its backside. So all you need to do is hop into Free Roam (press '+' on the main menu), track down the vehicle, and follow it around for a while.</p>

<p>Does it take all the fun out of it? Yeah, in our opinion, it probably does. But if you're someone who simply <em>has</em> to have every kart unlocked as quickly as possible, then this is definitely a viable option.</p>
<p>Or you can just keep playing the game naturally and you'll likely find that those coins will start piling up pretty quickly anyway. Up to you!</p>
<p>We'll have our final verdict on Mario Kart World very soon, but for the time being, check out our Review in Progress if you're keen to see what we think so far.</p>

<figure><a title="Favourite Course Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/497742fd6641d/favourite-course-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're willing to bet there are a fair few of you out there who spent the weekend up to your elbows in axle grease with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - would that be a fair assessment?</p>
<p>It's a big old game and we're <em>still</em> working on finalising our review of the Switch 2 launch game after getting our hands on it last Thursday, and while you can read our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">in-progress impressions</a> right now, you'll have to wait a little longer for our final verdict. (It's not much of a spoiler to say that they're mainly positive, though.)</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749559775 -->
<p>However, having gotten a good handle on it in the past few days (Felix had put in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTOghSITWvw">over 30 hours</a> before the weekend was out) and explored the titular World <em>a lot</em>, we're keen to find out your standout tracks so far.</p>
<p><em>Tracks, as in circuits, or tracks, as in music off the soundtrack?</em> you may well ask. Well, despite the incredible number of killer cuts that play as you race, today we'll be focusing on the courses - but watch this space for a musical deep-dive at some point!</p>
<p>You'll find a poll at the bottom, but let's hear first from Team NL and get their picks...</p>
<h2>Space Race &amp; Movie Magic (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>

<p>This might be my favourite selection of new courses in Mario Kart history. I know the intermission tracks are divisive, but in terms of visual variety and layout? It's staggering. I've spent all weekend thinking about this question.</p>
<p>I've settled on the two that I think are the most different from anything we've had before — <strong>DK Spaceport</strong> and <strong>Boo Cinema</strong>. The former is <em>such</em> a fun tribute to the original arcade <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a>, chasing a robotic version of DK with the iconic music from the arcade remixed perfectly. It's an eight-checkpoint race up a huge structure with so many twists and turns. I love it.</p>
<p>Boo Cinema is self-explanatory. How have we not had a movie theatre race course before? Plus, I love Boo (and King Boo, often my go-to MK character since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Double Dash</a>). This course was made for me. Jumping through the screen with the sepia scenery and movie reels? And a little bit of Banshee Boardwalk outside? <em>Ugh</em>. Magic.</p>
<p>I have a million honourable mentions — Cheep Cheep Falls, Whistlestop Summit, Acorn Heights. But I might be restrained if I continue.</p>
<h2>Anything with water (Gavin Lane, editor)<br></h2>

<p>Watch out, here comes the 40-something gaming dude with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/wave_race_64">Wave Race</a> fetish!</p>
<p>Yes, the moment I saw MKW's hot wave tech, I was jonesing to see how Nintendo would channel its AWOL jet ski series. And my word, it's got me worried that an <em>actual</em> new Wave Race might feel a bit vanilla after the hijinx of hop-boosting off crests and lobbing projectiles while zipping across the water.</p>
<p>If you want a specific course, <strong>Wario's Galleon</strong> was the first water course I encountered and it made a serious impression. I've barely touched the Free Roam mode just yet, but I feel like I'll be spending a lot of my time in the brine.</p>
<h2>Life, uh, finds a way (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>

<p>I love me some dinosaurs.</p>
<p>So naturally, I've gravitated immediately toward the new version of <strong>Dino Dino Jungle</strong>. Being able to dash up the Triceratops' head to get an early boost is a thrill, and avoiding the stomping Brachiosaurus and T-Rex will never stop being fun. Plus, the music reminds me of Alton Towers, somehow, which just dredges up some wonderful childhood memories.</p>
<p>I also adore <strong>Starview Peak</strong>, if only because the twisty-turny waterways remind me of the Loopdeeloop Galaxy from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. Racing through for the first time brought back memories of the Manta Ray Surfing, and I only wish the game offered this up as a vehicle option.</p>
<h2>The ultimate question (block) (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>

<p>Gosh, can I say "every circuit"? No? Okay, fine, I'll narrow it down, but if you think I'm going to be able to stick to just one, you've got another thing coming.</p>
<p>I'm a sucker for anything that has a really cool flying sequence in it. It's why I've always loved DK Mountain so much, and it's why I was grinning cheek to cheek when I first flew up to <strong>The Great ? Block Ruins</strong>. Aside from its awesome Indiana Jones vibes and the shortcut potential that I'll never be skilled enough to use, this track is just <em>so</em> gosh-darn cool! It's all high-flying jumps and wicked rail riding - eat your heart out, Tony Hawk.</p>
<p>I'm going to throw in a mention for <strong>Rainbow Road</strong>, too. It's one of the easier variants out there, I'll admit, but it's such a wonderful victory lap for the game itself, with all those little nods to the circuits before it — if you haven't spotted the train yet, you're in for a treat. Oh yeah, <em>and</em> it has the sharp, ace ascent to get up to it. What can I say, I'm a predictable chap.</p>
<h2>The one where you fall off a lot (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>

<p><strong>Rainbow Road</strong> is, and always will be, my favourite MK track for the simple reason that, ever since the OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> back in '92, it's the one that puts the fear factor front and centre (for a man of my modest driving skills, at least). This is the track that I get sweaty thinking about, because my timings need to be <em>reasonably</em> good for fast snaking through corners that, if misjudged, lead to a very time-consuming drop into the abyss.</p>
<p>Looking back on the first Rainbow Road, my brain imagines something in line with the majestic, cloud-buffeted spectacle presented here in Mario Kart World, where in fact it's actually a very rudimentary course indeed. But the corners, those corners remain a constant, and the thing that has kept this track, in its various guises, as my fave time and again. It may look approximately 1,000,000,000 times better these days, but the core conceit remains. This is the track where you get a little test on those drift skills.</p>
<p>Oh, and this might actually be my favourite variant of RR in ages, too. I love the lead into it, the magically crumbling start to the blocks, how the karts are lifted up through the air to it, and how you can see the twisting course spread out across the cloudscape ahead as you barrel along. What a cracker - and an insanity in multiplayer!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>So there you have it. It's tough, though, because the way Grand Prix works in this one, some of those transition routes between circuits are pretty neat in their own right!</em></p>
<p><em>Let us know in the poll below your favourite tracks of the 30 available (remember that Crown City and Peach Stadium are repeated in Grand Prix mode with different variants), and take to the comments if there's a specific highway, byway, or raceway section that's floating your kart-turned-boat.</em></p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52f3926191f6c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was widely anticipated to be the biggest console launch of all time in the weeks leading up to its release, and according to new information from <a href="https://x.com/GyoJvfr/status/1932014842652590330">Gyo</a> on X (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-switch-2-may-have-obliterated-ps5s-launch-record-in-france">Push Square</a>), the console may have already broken records in France.</p>
<p>Over the first weekend, the Switch 2 is said to have sold more than 200,000 units in the region. This is almost double what the previous record-holder PS5 managed in the same time period back in 2020 when it shifted around 107,000 units. Now, it's important to keep in mind that the PS5 launched smack bang in the middle of a global pandemic, so supplies were unusually constrained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Switch 2 is a HIT in France. Here are some (mind-blowing) numbers:</p>
<p>- More than 200,000 units sold in the first weekend<br>
- More than 100 million in revenue from consoles alone...<br>
- We go up to more than 130 million with games and accessories<br>
- 70% of sales are Mario Kart packs<br>
- Only 3 to 5% of Switch 2 buyers did not buy Mario Kart</p>
<p>I remind you that I am talking about the French market only.<br>
For a small comparison, the PS5 PRO had not exceeded 10,000 units.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skip ahead to the Switch launch, and although the console <em>is</em> sold out in many stores throughout the world, stock is definitely a lot more readily available when compared to the PS5. Still, 200,000 is a remarkable number, and we suspect we'll see some more record-breaking sales figures in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Remember, Nintendo has forecast a total of 15 million Switch 2 sales for the current financial year. The company managed to sell 15 million original Swith consoles during its first year on sale, and despite some concerns around pricing for the successor, we're fairly confident Nintendo will hit its target.</p>
