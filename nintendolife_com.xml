<p>That's right, no Game-Key Card!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega has just earned itself a big win by confirming that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> on the Switch 2 will <em>not</em> be a Game-Key Card when it launches physically in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company confirmed that Crossworlds will launch digitally on Switch 2 in Holiday 2025 and physically in Early 2026, with two versions available for digital purchases. The standard is priced at <strong>£64.99</strong> and the Digital Deluxe is priced at <strong>£74.99</strong>. It's not known at this time how much the physical version will cost.</p>
<p>Crucially, Sega states that the physical release "will feature the full base game on the cartridge". So no Game-Key Card! Rejoice! We've reached out to Sega to triple check, but the wording seems pretty clear to us.</p>
<p>Sega has also reiterated that those who purchase the game on Switch 1 will be eligible for a paid upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Again, pricing has not been confirmed for this at the time of writing, but we'd probably expect it to be around £10 or so. We'll see.</p>
<p>Finally, a new trailer looking at customisation in the game has been released. It's looking pretty awesome so far, and we can't wait to take the game for a spin properly when it launches.</p>
<p>If you're not bothered about waiting for the Switch 2 version, Crossworlds will launch elsewhere, including Switch 1, on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Ready for day one</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6fa0513cf8f9/bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch2/software_support/aaaca/110/index.html">released a day one update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, bringing the game to <strong>Version 1.1.0</strong> and introducing some predictable, but welcome additions and improvements (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-1-1-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>The update should automatically download when you receive your game then, but if in doubt, you can always manually check for any updates by pressing '+' on the game icon. If you're not on Version 1.1.0, simply select 'Software Update' and go from there.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at what's coming up in this new update...</p>
<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza - Ver. 1.1.0 (Released 16th July, 2025)</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now select “GameShare with people nearby” or “GameShare via GameChat” from the “Play with two people” option in the pause menu.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been fixed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That's yer lot! As we say, it's pretty standard stuff, but whatever's been done to improve the gameplay experience is a win in our book.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on 17th July and has received high acclaim across the board. Our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10 review</a> called it "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK", while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-donkey-kong-bananza">other outlets were similarly enthusiastic</a>.</p>
