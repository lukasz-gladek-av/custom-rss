<p>Now including Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="61f9987b6acda"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61f9987b6acda/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's not every day there's a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> release, and after an 18-year wait since the last major entry in the Prime series, the fourth adventure is finally here.</p>
<p>To mark this occasion, Metacritic has now <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/every-metroid-game-ranked-worst-to-best/">rounded up <em>every</em> Metroid game</a> in its database to share a look at each title's metascore (based on the aggregate score of critic reviews). This includes not only the Prime games but also the spin-offs, Samus' 2D outings, and the re-releases.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are some omissions – including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> (NES, 1987), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> (Game Boy, 1991), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> (SNES, 1994), and that's simply because these games were released well before Metacritic even existed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceqxnkwu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>One other thing to note is the metascore for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is based on the Switch 2 Edition of the game. Switch reviews are still 'TBD' on Metacritic, although our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">own mini review for this version of the game is now live</a>.</p>

<p>Although these rankings are based on the aggregate of critic scores, if you're looking for a second opinion, we've got our own "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-metroid-games-of-all-time?page=2">best Metroid games of all time</a>" list here on Nintendo Life based on user ratings. The title at the top of our list is Super Metroid, with the original Prime entry in second place and Metroid Dread in third. We've not added Prime 4 to this list just yet.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about Samus' latest adventure, be sure to check out both of our reviews. The Switch 2 version offers the best experience, but if you're not planning to get a Switch 2 anytime soon, the Switch version is still well worth picking up.</p>

<p>"Happy gaming!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Many Switch games have been receiving compatibility updates for the Switch 2, and following an update to one of Square Enix's games earlier this week, it seems the indie developer Brace Yourself Games has now rolled out a fix for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a>.</p>
<p>If you've been experiencing any crashes when playing this rhythm-based Switch game on the Switch 2, the good news is that a patch has now been rolled out to fix this issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Crypt of the NecroDancer - Switch 2 Update</strong></p>
<p>If you've been having trouble playing Crypt of the NecroDancer on Switch 2, we've got good news to you!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>We just released a patch to fix the issue that was causing the game to crash. Thank you for your patience, and happy gaming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100cea007d08000">compatibility page</a> does not appear to reflect this fix at the time of writing, but if there are any other significant updates to this game, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer originally made its debut on the Switch eShop in 2018. The developer's latest release is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> which is fully compatible on the Switch 2. The Zelda spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cadence_of_hyrule_crypt_of_the_necrodancer_featuring_the_legend_of_zelda">Cadence of Hyrule</a> is also compatible with Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>This follows multiple compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. This included updates for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>

<p>From the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a fan of retro-style first-person shooters and want to eradicate swarms of alien bugs, you might want to check out this new game when it arrives in early 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/starship-troopers-ultimate-bug-war">Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!</a> is developed by Auroch Digital (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>) and published by Dotemu (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>), and will be coming to the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>Here's some additional information, and you can listen to General Johnny Rico's recruitment message in the video above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set 25 years after the events of the original <em>Starship</em> Troopers film, this heroic campaign follows war veteran Samantha Dietz as she recounts her hunt for the dreadful Assassin Bug during the First Bug War. Relive her experiences as you annihilate the Arachnids on their familiar home world of Klendathu and journey to all new worlds like Planet P and beyond in this streamlined solo campaign, with access to a devastating arsenal of 14 weapons (including the iconic Morita rifle), 11 Tactical Supports and a Mech vehicle in a gloriously gory 3D pixelated combat simulation.</p>
<p>Citizens looking to prepare themselves to the fullest extent can utilize <em>Starship</em> Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!’s anti-bug combat training, where you can play from the perspective of the Bugs, and prepare for the skills they need to erase the insectoid threat.</p>
