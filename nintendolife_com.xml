            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Metroidvania revival (did it ever really go away?) keeps rolling, and here comes another stylised combat-platformer where a strange little hero gets lost in a dark, labyrinthine fantasy world.</p>
<p>This time, our protagonist is John, who stumbles into a bizarre realm full of somnambulist weirdos and giant babies. Studio Cima has crafted a disturbing, stylised trip that deftly builds on themes of psychological trauma and fear. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/perfect_pencil">The Perfect Pencil</a> can be pretty impenetrable at times, but it stays compelling throughout.</p>
<p>John’s actual goal is never fully clear, which only adds to the fever-dream vibe of the world he wanders through. Initially headless, he acquires an old projector for a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bonce">bonce</a> and ventures out armed with nothing but a giant pencil.</p>
<p>Bedtime iconography is everywhere: NPCs speak in riddles, and you’re never totally sure who’s trying to help you and who’s planning to stab you in the back. Both enemies and allies are equally creepy. John meets dead‑eyed sleepwalkers wrapped in random junk, or oddball creatures offering to teach him martial arts.</p>
<p>The Camera Obscura atop John’s neck lets him scan the environment, which helps with navigating the (sometimes pretty convoluted) map and uncovering secrets tied to the main quest.</p>
<p>While a lot of recent Metroidvanias lean heavily on tough combat and tricky platforming chains, The Perfect Pencil is more focussed on exploration. You’ll poke around its surreal dreamscape, run side‑tasks for NPCs, and upgrade John’s projector with ability‑boosting filaments.</p>
<p>There’s still a solid amount of combat as you battle with those sleepy enemies scattered across the games diverse biomes. They’re not especially tough, but their placement can lead to some annoying deaths and long runbacks. Boss fights are fun setpieces with bigger enemies that are literal manifestations of the game’s themes. Like their smaller counterparts, they also love flattening John and sending him back to distant save points.</p>
<p>John fights these Tim Burton‑esque foes with a simple melee offence. His most useful skill is a heal strike that converts the energy from consecutive attacks into a health‑restoring hit. It’s a neat ability that stays handy throughout the game. His attacks can be upgraded by spending a resources scattered throughout the levels and by defeating enemies.</p>
<p>Combat and traversal across this uniquely designed world feels smooth in both handheld and docked modes, with zero performance issues. This has none of the razors-edge twitchiness of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">Mio</a>, but it's nice to see the painstaking art style in clear detail during John's tribulations. The Switch continues to be a comfortable home for artistically-driven Metroidvanias.</p>
<p>Despite being another in an ever increasing genre stable, The Perfect Pencil brings a uniquely twisted world to the genre. Its mysteries can be a bit dense, but the eerie atmosphere, complex themes, and strange landscapes make it worth exploring.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-perfect-pencil]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Hades Voice Actors Reunite In The BAFTA-Nominated Visual Novel 'Vampire Therapist']]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hades-voice-actors-reunite-in-the-bafta-nominated-visual-novel-vampire-therapist</link>
            <guid>1425052</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> voice actor Cyrus Nemati (Ares, Dionysus, Theseus) brought the therapy visual novel Vampire Therapist to PC. It reunited Nemati with a bunch of his Supergiant co-stars, picked up a BAFTA nomination, and landed a fair few '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/#app_reviews_hash">Overwhelmingly Positive</a>' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/">Steam</a> reviews in the process. The crème de la crème is that later this month, we'll all get to check it out on Switch.</p>
<p>Little Bat Games (founded by Nemati, no less) has today announced that Vampire Therapist will arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>17th February</strong> — hey, that's right around the corner!</p>
<p>This one sees you step into the immortal shoes of a reformed vampire from the Wild West, who's given up his gunslinging to instead guide his fellow neck-biters through the wonderful world of therapy. It was written with a real therapist on hand, so all of the advice, listening, and conversations are rooted in real cognitive behavioural therapy concepts. Don't worry, it also stars a bunch of wacky vampires, so there's no shortage of laughs amongst the deep stuff, too.</p>
<p>Alongside Nemati himself, the voice cast also includes Hades / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> alumni Francesca Meaux (Eurydice) and Sarah Grayson (Selene), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole">Critical Role</a>'s Matt Mercer — damn, when does this guy sleep?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Real Therapy Concepts:</strong> You’ll learn and apply real cognitive behavioral therapy concepts vetted by licensed therapists. By challenging client statements that contain “cognitive distortions”, you’ll help vampires see where their thoughts don’t match reality.<br>
<strong>A Comedic Look Through History:</strong> Meet emotionally damaged vampires from ancient Greece, Renaissance Italy, revolutionary France, Tudor England, and Iron Age Ireland.<br>
<strong>An All-Star Voice Cast:</strong> Featuring Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Baldur's Gate 3), Francesca Meaux (Hades), Sarah Grayson (Gone Home, Hades II), Kylie Clark, and the game's creator, Cyrus Nemati (Hades, Pyre).<br>
<strong>Unique Setting:</strong> Vampire Therapist merges cozy self-introspection with a dark European goth vibe. In fact, the whole thing takes place above a goth club in Germany filled with willing necks to bite.<br>
<strong>Minigames:</strong> Learn mindfulness meditation, safely and consensually bite sexy necks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Switch version includes the base game with all of its free content updates, <em>and</em> bundles the 'Couples Therapy' DLC in there too. Little Bat has confirmed that the game has also been "revamped" with improved controller support, so there shouldn't be any worries there either.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like it could be a rather interesting one for those after something in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/coffee_talk">Coffee Talk</a> vein. We'll have to wait and see how it stacks up on Switch in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Will you be checking it out on Switch later this month? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hades-voice-actors-reunite-in-the-bafta-nominated-visual-novel-vampire-therapist]]></content:encoded>

But if you're not keen on splashing out on the <strong>$66.99 / $99.99</strong> replica or its cheaper cardboard equivalent, then you <em>might</em> be in luck.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> kit lying around gathering dust, then you'll want to dig it out in the coming days. According to <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/nintendos-virtual-boy-classics-will-be-playable-on-labo-vr-headsets/">GamesBeat</a>, a Nintendo Treehouse staff member has confirmed that the cardboard peripheral will be compatible with Virtual Boy on NSO.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tzvpoy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now just to be absolutely sure, we've reached out directly to Nintendo and will update this article once we get confirmation. But honestly, it kind of makes sense that Labo VR would be compatible, and hopefully this will make the prospect of playing Virtual Boy a little easier for current owners.</p>
<p>Released in 2019, the VR headset could be used with big-hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. Nintendo has not opted to utilise it in recent years, but the cardboard variant of the Virtual Boy headset has definitely taken some inspiration. It will launch alongside the full-fat replica for a more affordable <strong>£16.99 / $24.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you plan on using your Labo VR kit, then you'll need to consider that the Switch 2 simply won't fit inside the peripheral. So you'll need to stick with the OG Switch, but Virtual Boy will thankfully be compatible with both systems.</p>
