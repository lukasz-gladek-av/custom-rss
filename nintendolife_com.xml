<figure data-uuid="eb5c8d1d3feff"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb5c8d1d3feff/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom is truly treating us Switch 2 owners this week, as it releases not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Village</a> on the new hardware, but also the brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a>. Yep, that's on the same day as other platforms!</p>
<p>All of these launch on <strong>27th February</strong> (a Pokémon Day surprise, if we've ever seen one), and today, the Requiem reviews have started rolling in to clue us up on Leon and Grace's latest.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a fantastic time with RE9, calling it "a love letter that celebrates RE’s origins; one that will have you grinning from ear to ear until the credits roll" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a brief snippet, followed by the full shebang, so you can catch all the details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem sets a new benchmark for a series that has been pretty consistently great for the last decade or so. By combining classic survival horror with the more action-focused gameplay of RE4, the result is an experience paced to perfection. Add in a lore-heavy narrative and copious easter eggs, and you've got what might be the ultimate expression of Resident Evil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, of course, we're not the only ones with a Requiem review out today. Being the big multi-platform release that it is, there are a fair few write-ups for the game at large across the internet, and below, we've gathered a bunch of them together for you to easily see the full range of opinions. Do note that while we've highlighted some reviews that focus solely on the Switch 2 version, many outlets will have been playing on different platforms.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a full beans 10/10 score for the PS5 version from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/resident-evil-requiem-the-mercenaries-mode-326263-20260215">GAMINGbible</a>, where the outlet praised just about everything the game had to offer, particularly in its lore drops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a horror game in its own right, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is a very solid nine out of ten, but as a passionate fan of the series, it earns an additional bonus point thanks to the attention to detail and craft that’s gone into every pore of this game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full scores kept coming with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-review">Eurogamer</a>'s 5/5 review, where even the game's strange second act wasn't enough to detract from the overall experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Requiem uneven? Absolutely. Does it eventually, slightly, run out of steam? I think that's a fair criticism too. But carried away on a wave of increasing nostalgia, I didn't especially care</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/resident-evil-requiem/review">Pocket Tactics</a> opted for the same score as us in another 9/10 Switch 2 review, calling out how impressively well the title runs on Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It runs incredibly well on the Nintendo Switch 2, boasts a compelling cast, and a story that fits nicely into the Resident Evil universe at large</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an opinion that was echoed in <a href="https://www.vooks.net/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-review/">Vooks</a>' 4.5/5 review of the Switch 2 version, where the hybrid's visuals got a major nod of their own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t say it’s the very first visually impressive game running on the Switch 2; however, it does stand out as one of the first day-and-date games that truly holds its own</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Switch 2 version was laden with even more praise in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-review">TechRadar Gaming</a>'s 4/5 review, even if the outlet was a little disappointed with the game's second half:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To developer Capcom’s credit, while events may veer unapologetically into the camp and ridiculous, I was practically on the edge of my seat, wondering what on Earth could possibly happen next</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a slightly lower PS5 review, our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/resident-evil-requiem">Push Square</a> gave Requiem an 8/10 after struggling with the "imbalance" between the survival horror and action gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is brilliant, both when you’re avoiding zombies as Grace and cracking their skulls as Leon — but, eventually, there’s slightly too much of one and not enough of the other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll round things out with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-review-36772690">The Mirror</a>'s multiplatform 3/5 review, where, despite the "drop-dead gorgeous" visuals (even on Switch 2), that sense of imbalance was enough to bring things down a little:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem attempts to blend all eras of the franchise together with a dual-pronged campaign that features terrifically scary highs and some all-too terrifying lows</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em>Some</em> range in opinions, then, but it looks rather positive overall. As it stands, Resident Evil Requiem on Switch 2 is currently sitting at a 90 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/resident-evil-requiem/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metascore</a> across 12 critic reviews, and an 88 on PS5 across 112.</p>

Oh boy, here we go again...</p>
<p>The new version is now live on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Balatro-3037082.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£12.79 / $14.99</strong> (with a sweet NA sale bringing it down to $11.99), or as a <em>free upgrade</em> for anyone who already owns the Switch 1 base game — come on, it's difficult to argue with that.</p>
<p>The eShop listing doesn't go into any detail about what's added on the new hardware, but we're already taking it for a spin and have noticed a smooth 60fps bump, HD Rumble 2, and the addition of Mouse Mode for super quick card selection.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8uGWdOGD83w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uGWdOGD83w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8uGWdOGD83w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8uGWdOGD83w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uGWdOGD83w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed41126extnyjm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p>It's all a very welcome sight, and an unfortunate sign that we're probably signing ourselves up to another batch of sleepless nights. The only wrinkle that we've found so far is that there doesn't seem to be any way to transfer your data from the Switch 1 version to the Switch 2, which is weird. We'll keep investigating and will update this post if we find a workaround.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed this one back in 2024, we described the original Balatro as "Utterly sublime" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/balatro">our 10/10 review</a>, praising just about everything it could throw at us.</p>
