<figure><a title="Final Fantasy IX Calendar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d0cb0e6398e67/final-fantasy-ix-calendar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yuya Ishihata / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> is about to celebrate its 25th anniversary; the incredible turn-based RPG launched on the PS1 on 7th July 2000, and in 2025, Square Enix has been busy building up to the event with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/final-fantasy-9-remake-hopes-rise-as-square-enix-teases-anniversary-projects">frequent new merch drops</a> (much to the chagrin of this author and her wallet).</p>
<p>Over the past few days, the developer has upped the ante and has been sharing brand new artwork. We're up to three already, and it's causing fans online to go into overdrive.</p>
<p>Let's start with the newest piece, which dropped overnight. This beautiful piece sees Zidane, Garnet, and the rest of the party overlooking the Iifa Tree, an important location in the game's story. Drawn by the game's character designer Toshiyuki Itahana, you can see the two planets in the sky and the Silver Dragon in the distance.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lvqsnp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Oh, and we'd be remiss not to point out Vivi and Steiner at the bottom there. So. Cute.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy IX Iifa Tree" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0debb91419928/final-fantasy-ix-iifa-tree.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1940214096668115057">Toshiyuki Itahana / Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Responses to the piece are... not-so-measured, as you'd expect. A Final Fantasy IX remake has been rumoured for an extremely long time, and what better time to reveal it than the game's 25th anniversary? Especially when you're giving it <em>this</em> much promotion.</p>
<p>So some fans suspect that these art pieces are actually <a href="https://x.com/TinaClarkwinkel/status/1940003601377620033">concept art</a> for that reimagining. Others just think it's a <a href="https://x.com/YunalesckaGames/status/1940281425472950462">tantalising tease</a> for some kind of announcement. We've even got <a href="https://x.com/FtMonkey/status/1940226445835657532">box art mock-ups</a>. Whatever it is, Final Fantasy IX fans are going a little nuts.</p>
<p>There are two more stunning pieces to look at, anyway. First up is a calendar illustration featuring the main cast on the stage of the M.S. Prima Vista, the Tantalus' theatre ship. This one's done by Yuya Ishihata, who's created a ton of beautiful artwork for the <a href="http://www.square-enix-shop.com/jp/ff-tcg//card/illust_YuyaIshihata.html">Final Fantasy X Magic the Gathering collab</a>.</p>
<p>The usual suspects, including Beatrix, are all here, but if you look in the crowd, you can also see members of the Theatre Troupe, the group of thieves Zidane is part of, there; Marcus, Blank, Cinna, Ruby, Baku, and Benero and Zenero.</p>

<p>Last and by no means least is another piece from character designer Itahana. This one shows the game's primary antagonist, Kuja, standing inside the Iifa Tree, next to his Silver Dragon.</p>
<p>It's oddly peaceful as Kuja looks out towards the sunlight, either waiting for the party towards the end of Disc 2 or perhaps just there to plot.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy IX Kuja" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cc3ce1ac5887/final-fantasy-ix-kuja.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1939881904750395674">Toshiyuki Itahana / Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, perhaps even more artwork will pop up over the next week. We should stress that there's no guarantee Square Enix will announce <em>anything</em> when 7th July rolls around, so don't be too disappointed if that happens. The Final Fantasy IX remake isn't official, and if it's real, it'll come when it comes.</p>
<p>After all, it's kind of fun just to see the game get a lot of love in the form of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/final-fantasy-ix-just-got-a-picture-book-prequel-in-japan-featuring-the-games-best-character">picture book prequels</a>, vinyl releases, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/random-is-this-the-best-piece-of-final-fantasy-merch-ever">the most adorable mug you've ever seen</a>, right?</p>

<figure><a title="Gallery: Street Fighter's Luke amiibo Is A Big Boy, And No Mistake 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e7c57ca7e826/gallery-street-fighters-luke-amiibo-is-a-big-boy-and-no-mistake-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The welcome news that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> was getting its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/street-fighter-6-amiibo-revealed-price-exclusive-rewards-and-amiibo-cards">own range of amiibo</a> was countered somewhat by the <em>less</em> welcome news that they would also be getting a price increase, but Nintendo can at least argue for that rise on one front: these figures <em>are</em> bigger than what has come before.</p>
<p>Luke, Kimberly, and Jamie have all received their own amiibo, and we've managed to get our hands on the cover star himself.</p>
<p>As you can see from the photos below, Luke towers above Ryu, Ken, and Terry and feels more weighty and substantial.</p>

<figure><a title="Gallery: Street Fighter's Luke amiibo Is A Big Boy, And No Mistake 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56dca29547cf1/gallery-street-fighters-luke-amiibo-is-a-big-boy-and-no-mistake-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>It's not just his size which is a step up from other amiibo, however; like his fellow <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-amiibo">Street Fighter 6 characters</a>, Luke unlocks special items in the game, such as unique music tracks, wallpapers and backgrounds (the latter being used with the in-game camera functionality).</p>
<p>Does this mean that Luke and company are worth the extra money? We'll let you decide on that score, but these larger figures do offer the potential for more detailed features.</p>

<figure><a title="Xbox Game Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afd3dfea7a4b5/xbox-game-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft has begun informing staff of a huge second wave of job cuts this year, and the layoffs are expected to hit over 9,000 employees.</p>
<p>In a report published by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, studios affected include King — the team behind Candy Crush — where around 200 staff (roughly 10%) are being laid off, and ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. Staff have informed Schreier they weren't authorised to speak to the press.</p>
<p>Other US-based studios will be told of the cuts later today, and the cuts go beyond the gaming division. Many who are losing their jobs today only found out about the incoming cuts due to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?srnd=undefined">a previous Bloomberg report</a>. These layoffs follow the 2,000 cuts made in January 2024, and the closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May 2024.</p>
<p>It's galling stuff, and it comes despite the fact that, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html">CNBC</a>, " $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter". As a result, it's reportedly one of the most profitable companies in the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKu_ZSYOos0cnYjMoZ4Emgzx0Wk4z-5LcUARMrLW2FCD-ZYxhyklcUDTygMIUSiLefK1-1OeNKSWM_l1u9MD9aYTQ_REJLnvOcWVKyoM2EgLGDenVhZTizdXJcASovGM9lfMplCFYMhblYNKLSoU7URjjmOlT3xcL_i9Ejt4b8TD">S&amp;P 500 index</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN also reports</a> that Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer has been vague on the details, telling staff in a memo that organisational shifts and changes "will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days".</p>
<p>Below is Spencer's note in full, sent to staff and shared by IGN earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p>
<p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p>
<p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p>
<p>—Phil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rare may also be part of the layoffs as the studio's upcoming action game <strong>Everwild</strong> — which was bound for Xbox and PC — has reportedly been cancelled as part of the cuts.</p>
